Online classes have become a new paradigm of education, and are expected to develop and be maintained in various forms even after the end of COVID-19. Therefore, attention is focused on finding ways to improve learners’ achievements in a distance learning environment.

Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficients, multiple regression, and mediation analysis using SPSS/WIN 26.0 program.ResultsThere were significant positive correlations among self-directed learning competency, optimism, emotional intelligence and academic resilience. The self-directed learning competency acts as a mediator in explaining relationship between optimism, emotional intelligence and academic resilience, respectively.ConclusionThis study provides the evidence for the role of self-directed learning competency in the relationship between optimism, emotional intelligence and academic resilience in nursing students.
