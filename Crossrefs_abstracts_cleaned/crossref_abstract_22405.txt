SummaryUnder the aperiodic Denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks, this paper studies the resilient adaptive event‐triggered synchronization control problem for a class of Piecewise‐Homogeneous Uncertain Markov Jump Neural Networks (PHUMJNNs) with time‐varying delays. First of all, a new way of carving DoS attacks is given from the defenders' perspective, that is, aperiodic DoS attacks based on fixed detection periods. Then, under such attacks, a new Resilient Adaptive Event‐triggered Communication (RAETC) is designed between sensor and controller, which has a threshold function based on the net change rate and is real‐time updated depending on the present sampling state. Next, a single functional is used in the construction of the Lyapunov‐Krasovskii functional, while a new looped functional is introduced that makes full use of the state information of the current instant , the trigger instant  and the next trigger instant . Based on the constructed single functional, under the framework of the input delay method and the linear matrix inequality technique, the exponential mean square stabilization criterion of the error system is obtained, which makes the master system and the slave system synchronized. In the end, three simulation examples are used to illustrate the validity of the obtained results.
