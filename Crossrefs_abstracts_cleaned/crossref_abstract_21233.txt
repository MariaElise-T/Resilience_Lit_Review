The economic and social well‐being of rural, “resource‐cursed” communities can depend on the boom‐bust cycles of a single industry like oil and gas. This study used a constructivist, inductive approach to identify the challenges placed on families in one such community and the processes that strengthen family resilience. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 35 adult residents (30–76 years old, 19 women) from a community in Alberta, Canada, that has specialized in oil and gas extraction for 70 years and experienced its worst economic downturn while the study was underway. Results showed that many families have experienced an endless cycle of poor work–life balance and income instability throughout the economic cycle. Family life often lacked social cohesion as a consequence of demanding work schedules and economic pressures. Additional challenges were the perceived negative effects of rigid gender roles, substance abuse, family conflicts, and domestic violence. Crucial strengthening processes for family resilience were fundamental financial and living standard adaptations (e.g., living within or below one’s economic means; having both spouses become earners), maintaining regular contact by having a flexible home routine, and mutually agreeing to change roles during busts (former earners take responsibility for caregiving and running of the household and vice versa). Alternatively, accepting economic volatility and its impact on normal family life processes were essential for family resilience. Findings suggest the need for clinicians to help families foster resilience in communities that depend on resource extraction industries with concurrent adaptations required by individuals, families, and socio‐political and economic systems.
