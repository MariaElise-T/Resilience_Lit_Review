Child adversity is often associated with poor quality of life in pediatric gastrointestinal disorders, including non-allergic food reactions (food intolerances), which may be improved using mind-body interventions. We conducted an observational study to (1) describe child adversity (stressors) and resilience factors in children with food intolerances, and (2) explore the association between stressors and self-reported use of integrative modalities. A retrospective chart review of children â‰¥4-years-old presenting to a pediatric food intolerances clinic from 2017 to 2020 was performed (n = 130). Use of integrative medicine at intake, demographic, illness, and social history data were collected. Qualitative analysis identified exposure to stressors and resilience strategies. Correlation was assessed using a chi-square test. Management of the medical condition was the most common stressor, indicating impact on quality of life. Resilience strategies included themes of self-coping and social support. Individuals with one or more stressors were more likely to be using an integrative modality (most commonly, mind-body interventions) prior to their visit (X2 = 8.1, p = 0.004). Our hypothesis-generating study suggests that screening for child adversity and integrative medicine use may be used to better address quality of life and personalized approaches to treat pediatric food intolerances.
