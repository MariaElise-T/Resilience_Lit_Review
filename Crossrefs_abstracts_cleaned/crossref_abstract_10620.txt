The research methodology for this research comprised three stages. Stage one, to identify the health resilience from the previous studies. Content analysis was used in stage two to determine health resilience catalyst for the elderly. The final stage was to stream the influence element of health resilience for the elderly. The findings have implications for improving intervention plans designed to boost resilience and promote healthy ageing for the elderly.
