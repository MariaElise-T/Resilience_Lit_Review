God's Word s.w.t: Then set your face straight to the religion of Allah, the nature of Allah, which He created man above that nature; there is no change for the creation of the nature of God; that's a straight religion, but most people do not know it. Tawakal means surrendering decisions on all matters, efforts and endeavours to God of The Entire Universe. Tawakal is also an element that proves faithfulness and the Islamisation of a Muslim. Every human being who has been born to this earth has been created in the natural state; his heart always wants to face his God and wants to follow his religion; and the nature that God has created in every human being will never change, it will still voice the command to always return to the truth of God. Resilience is one aspect that is absolutely required by all Muslims when facing the COVID 19 Pandemic. There are several verses in the al-Quran that discuss the aspect of resilience or the capability of an individual to rise against adversities and overcome it.Â
