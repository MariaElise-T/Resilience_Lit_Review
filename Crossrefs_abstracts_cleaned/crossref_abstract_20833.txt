Background/Aims A family's economic resilience can impact a child's wellbeing, particularly in relation to parenting practice. This study aimed to identify the effect of family economic resilience on early childhood parenting in Indonesia, for children age 0–6 years old. Methods This study used cross-sectional data from a 2019 Indonesian survey. Simple and multiple logistic regression were used to analyse data for 20 413 families with children 0–6 years old in Indonesia. Results More than half of families had high economic function (56.2%) and demonstrated strong economic resilience (59.1%), although a similar proportion also demonstrated less effective parenting practices (63.3%). Families with high or moderate economic resilience were more likely to use more effective early childhood parenting practices than families with lower economic resilience (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Age, family type, number of family members and education significantly affected good parenting. Conclusions Family economic resilience has a significant impact on early childhood parenting. Interventions should be designed to simultaneously to strengthen family economic resilience and increase engagement with early childhood parenting practices.
