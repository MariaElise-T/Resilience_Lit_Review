 ABSTRACT: On April 8, 2021, legendary golfer Lee Elder stepped onto the first tee as an honorary starter at the historic Augusta National Golf Club—a club where 45 years prior he became the first Black golfer to integrate the Masters Tournament. As a participant at the 1975 Masters, Elder was the recipient of death threats and was forced to keep security close by for precautionary measures. In 2021, after a storied career, Elder returned to Augusta and was received in a more welcoming fashion. This article explores the career of Elder, including the golfer’s challenging upbringing, transition to the PGA, and participation in the 1975 Masters. Emphasis will be given to Augusta’s rationale to anoint Elder as an honorary starter. The article will also integrate the concept of resiliency to suggest that Elder’s success and ability to play golf through the most trying of racial circumstances is a testament to the golfer’s resiliency.
