In recent years, with the increasing concerns about the global warming, limited non-renewable energy sources, and uncertainty in renewable energy sources accessibility, how to continuously supply clean sources of energy in form of a resilient system structure has become a topic of intense scholarly interest. Based on the milestone literature on the research field of renewable and non-renewable energies, forest biomass and bioenergy have significant compatibility with both industry and nature. Through this, our proposal contributes to supply one of the most available clean energy sources and direct this type of energy needed in an optimal way. The essential resilience components are determined and classified according to the theoretical and practical concepts. Then, this research is made use of a conceptual decision-making model based on third order confirmatory factor analysis to explore the interactions among the components in form of a network. The results reveal that the proposed model has sufficient validity and reliability levels. Finally, key interactions among the elements of model that contributed to most of the impacts on the forest biomass and bioenergy supply chain resilience were found to be optimized constantly within the network.
