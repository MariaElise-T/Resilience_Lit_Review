AbstractBackgroundCognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) differs based on background genetics even with similar pathology. Using genetic linkage analysis, we identified a coding variant in the receptor binding domain of ApoE that leads to changes in cognitive performance across a genetically diverse population harboring familial (FAD) mutations known as the AD‐BXDs (Neuner et al., 2019). Using CRISPR‐based gene editing, we developed a C57BL/6J (B6) mouse carrying the ApoE allele from the DBA/2J (D2) strain (ApoEE163D) and determined that ApoEE163D mice with 5XFAD transgene (ApoEE163D‐5XFAD) are susceptible to cognitive decline compared to B6‐5XFAD mice (Kaczorowski, et al., 2022).Analysis of hippocampal RNA sequencing profiles from the hippocampus indicates robust transcriptomic changes in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells associated with cognitive resilience to FAD mutations in the presence of the B6 ApoE genotype. Here we aim to evaluate the functional implications.MethodWe adapted the Patch‐Seq method (Cadwell et al., 2017) to investigate transcriptional and electrophysiological changes within the DG associated with both FAD mutations and ApoE genotype. Whole‐cell patch clamp was used to evaluate intrinsic excitability of granule cells from 14month old B6 mice carrying FAD mutations and ApoEE163D, compared to age matched controls. The cellular contents, including the nucleus, were collected after each recording to characterize the transcriptome, and the cells were filled and stained for downstream analysis of neuronal morphology.ResultWe observed a significant interaction of the 5XFAD and ApoE genotypes on DG granule cell excitability. Specifically, cells from ApoEE163D‐5XFAD required less current stimulus to both elicit a single action potential, and to fire in response to a current ramp (rheobase). Although input resistance was comparable across all 4 groups, the sag ratio of ApoEE163D‐5XFAD was also reduced.ConclusionEnhancement of DG excitability of ApoEE163D‐5XFAD mice may underlie increased seizure susceptibility that has been reported previously in FAD animal models on D2 genetic background and associated with increased risk of seizures in AD patients. Ongoing work will integrate DG excitability with single‐cell RNAseq, morphology, and behavior to dissect mechanisms underlying the modifier effect of ApoE genotype on susceptibility and resilience to cognitive deficits in FAD mutation carriers.
