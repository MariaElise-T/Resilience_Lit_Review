Abstract
Sempu Island is one of the marine conservation areas, which has an important function in the conservation stage, namely preservation, preservation itself means the preservation of biodiversity and protected areas in biotic and abiotic life support systems. Many problems arise on Sempu Island as a protected area due to lack of access, which triggers a conflict of interest in the management of the area between policy makers and the community. Water quality is an important parameter for assessing water conditions and productivity associated with other biotic parameters, such as plankton and zooxanthellae. The method used in this research is quantitative method with direct in-situ data collection using water quality parameters measuring instrument AAQ Rinko 1183. Data collection was carried out at 15 station points in the Sempu Strait. The results obtained show that the average temperature in the Sempu Strait waters is 26.27 Â°C, turbidity is 0.40 ftu, salinity levels are 34.57 ppt, pH levels are 8.6, DO levels are 6.656074 mg / L, and chlorophyll content of 1.17 mg / m 3. This research is the result of preliminary research from the advanced research stage, which discusses the resilience of the Sempu Island aquatic ecosystem.
