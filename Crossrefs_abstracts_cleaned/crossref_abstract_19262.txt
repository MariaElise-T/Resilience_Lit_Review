AbstractObjectiveOur objectives were to examine cross‐sectional correlations of headache disability with measures of resilience, anxiety, and depression, and to determine if resilience modified the association between headache severity/frequency and disability.BackgroundResilience is associated with quality of life and functioning among patients with chronic conditions. We investigated whether resilience strongly mitigates headache‐related disability as measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS).MethodsWe prospectively recruited 160 patients with primary headache disorders seen in a tertiary headache medicine program between February 20, 2018 and August 2, 2019. Each participant completed the MIDAS, Conner Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS‐25), Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 (GAD‐7), and WHO‐5 Well‐Being Index.ResultsThe CDRS‐25 score was negatively correlated with the total MIDAS (r = −0.21, p = 0.009), GAD‐7 (r = −0.56, p < 0.001), and PHQ‐9 scores (r = −0.34, p < 0.001). Well‐being inversely correlated with disability (r = −0.37, p < 0.001). Increases in anxiety and depression increased the odds of disability. A 1 point increase in the CDRS‐25 score decreased the odds of being severely disabled by 4% (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.99, p = 0.001). However, the CDRS‐25 score did not significantly moderate the association between headache days and disability.ConclusionTraits associated with resilience decreased the odds of severe disability from headaches, whereas anxiety, depression, and headache frequency were strongly associated with higher disability from headache.
