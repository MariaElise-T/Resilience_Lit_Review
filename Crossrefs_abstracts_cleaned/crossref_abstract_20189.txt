Purpose
This study aimed to explore the association between family satisfaction, resilience, and anxiety and depression among adolescents, and the mediating role of resilience in these relationships.


Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among grade 8 to 9 students from 4 secondary schools in Hong Kong. A total of 1,146 participants completed the survey.


Results
Respectively 45.8% and 58.0% of students scored above the cut-off for mild anxiety and mild depression. Results from linear regression analyses showed that family satisfaction was positively associated with resilience, and both family satisfaction and resilience were and negatively associated with anxiety and depression. The mediating effects of resilience on the relationship between family satisfaction and anxiety/ depression (26.3% and 31.1% effects accounted for, respectively) were significant.


Conclusions
Both family satisfaction and resilience have important influence on adolescent mental health. Interventions that seek to promote positive family relationships and resilience of adolescents may be effective in preventing and reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among adolescents.
