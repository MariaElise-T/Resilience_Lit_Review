Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of the electrical activity of large medullary reticular formation neurons, in nucleus gigantocellularis, were performed under control conditions and under conditions of hypoxia or anoxia. Neurons were discovered whose activity was remarkably resilient during and after the reduction or loss of oxygen. Such cells may relate to the ability of the newborn brain to survive hypoxia/anoxia, and also may demonstrate the preservation of neurons involved in generalized CNS arousal, as would be appropriate for activating behavioral responses to the reduction or loss of oxygen.
