Objective.  This study used a longitudinal design to investigate the buffering role of resilience on worsening HbA1c and self‐care behaviours in the face of rising diabetes‐related distress.Method.  A total of 111 patients with diabetes completed surveys and had their glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) assessed at baseline and at 1‐year follow‐up. Resilience was defined by a factor score of self‐esteem, self‐efficacy, self‐mastery and optimism. Diabetes‐related distress and self‐care behaviours were also assessed.Results.  Baseline resilience, diabetes‐related distress and their interaction predicted physical health (HbA1c) at 1 year. Patients with low, moderate and high resilience were identified. Those with low or moderate resilience levels showed a strong association between rising distress and worsening HbA1c across time (r = .57, .56, respectively). However, those with high resilience scores did not show the same associations (r = .08). Low resilience was also associated with fewer self‐care behaviours when faced with increasing distress (r = −.55). These correlation coefficients remained significant after controlling for starting‐points.Conclusion.  In patients with diabetes, resilience resources predicted future HbA1c and buffered worsening HbA1c and self‐care behaviours in the face of rising distress levels.
