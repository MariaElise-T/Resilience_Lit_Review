Abstract
Experimental and clinical studies suggest that prenatal experiences may influence health trajectories up to adulthood and high age. According to the hypothesis of developmental origins of health and disease exposure of pregnant women to stress, nutritional challenges, infection, violence, or war may “program” risks for diseases in later life. Stress and anxieties can exist or be provoked in parents after fertility treatment, after information or diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and demand simultaneous caring concepts to support the parents. In vulnerable groups, it is therefore important to increase the stress resilience to avoid harmful consequences for the growing child. “Enriched environment” defines a key paradigm to decipher how interactions between genes and environment change the structure and function of the brain. The regulation of the fetal hippocampal neurogenesis and morphology during pregnancy is one example of this complex interaction. Animal experiments have demonstrated that an enriched environment can revert consequences of stress in the offspring during critical periods of brain plasticity. Epigenetic markers of stress or wellbeing during pregnancy might even be diagnosed by fragments of placental DNA in the maternal circulation that show characteristic methylation patterns. The development of fetal senses further illustrates how external stimulation may impact individual preferences. Here, we therefore not only discuss how maternal stress influences cognitive development and resilience, but also design possibilities of non-invasive interventions for both mothers and children summarized and evaluated in the light of their potential to improve the health of future generations.
