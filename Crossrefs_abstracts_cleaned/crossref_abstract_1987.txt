ABSTRACT

Objective
Resilient students may better navigate the challenges of chiropractic training. This study explored the relationships between response to stressful experiences, perceived stress, and quality of life among students at 1 US chiropractic college campus.


Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 873 students. The anonymous online questionnaire included demographics, quality of life, perceived stress, and the Response to Stressful Events Scale (RSES). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses assessed for significant relationships among variables.


Results
A sample of 221 students (60% female) completed the survey (25% response rate). Male respondents reported greater psychological health. Participants reporting high quality of life exhibited higher resiliency on the RSES flat score and many RSES domains. Respondents who rated greater psychological health and social relationships exhibited greater spiritual resiliency. Respondents reporting higher psychological health and lower levels of perceived stress exhibited higher self-efficacy resilience. Psychological health was the most important predictor for RSES flat score and domains, except for spiritual resilience, for which social relationships were most important. Male gender was predictive of 3 RSES domains: meaning making, active coping, and cognitive flexibility.


Conclusion
More resilient responses to stressful events were reported by male chiropractic students and those who reported greater psychological health, higher quality of life, or lower perceived stress. Female students and those experiencing psychological challenges or lower quality of life might consider resilience training to increase the use of protective coping strategies. These findings may permit academic institutions to identify students at highest risk and employ interventions to prevent program withdrawal.
