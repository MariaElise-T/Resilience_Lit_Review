One of the substantial concerns in any large scale enterprises is the process of evaluating, selecting and improving suppliers due to the involvement of many uncontrollable and unavoidable factors. To address this issue in industry, suppliers are selected in the context of a resilient supply chain since it is one way to overcome disruptions. Selection of suppliers involves a variety of both qualitative and quantitative attributes. This research proposes the five main criteria of supplier selection which are chosen based on vulnerable areas and production requirements to develop flexibility in procuring material. In order to select appropriate suppliers for optimal order allocation the fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) is proposed which overcomes the vagueness of the information. Also to calculate the importance of each criterion fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is used. Finally, the practical usefulness of the proposed method is ascertained through a case study in steel industry.
