AbstractThis Special Issue is dedicated to issues and challenges related to pandemic risk and resilience, with a focus on policy and operations of global systems in the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic. The cascading effects of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases to the global economy are a critical interest. Measures to confront the ongoing pandemic are an urgent need. Data analysis at regional and global scales is helping to prioritize response and resilience across locations of high risks. The risk sciences are available for addressing human health and infection risks; the evaluation of risk management strategies and tradeoffs; risk perception as it relates to information processing and receiving risk communication; and tracking system resilience as it relates to various imposed measures.
