Background: In recent years, research has witnessed an exciting change toward well-being and health instead of emphasizing disorders and inefficiency. The current study aimed to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based resilience training program on the psychological well-being of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The current study was quasi-experimental with a control group and a pre/post design. A sample of 30 students was randomly selected from a community of medical students at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in the academic year 2021-2022. These students were randomly divided into two groups of 15 participants. The tools used in this research included Ryff’s Psychological Well-Being Questionnaire (PWB-18) and an integrated training program for resilience and mindfulness. Results: The findings showed an integrated training program of resilience and mindfulness positively affected students’ psychological well-being. In addition, this intervention was able to explain 59% of the combined variance of psychological well-being variables. Conclusion: The results of the current study found that an integrated training program of resilience and mindfulness can improve individuals’ psychological well-being during a difficult situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
