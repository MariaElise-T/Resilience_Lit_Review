Abstract
The relentless penetration of information and communication systems into all spheres of life and the widespread use of digital technologies has been called “digital transformation”. Different systems demonstrate a different ability to effectively resist risks of any origin and nature, adapt to changes in the environment, maintain rapid recovery and return to maximally stable functioning. Such properties are generally called resilience. If these properties are acquired or enhanced through the use, application and development of digital technologies, we call them digital resilience. To analyze digital resilience, it is suggested to consider digital subscribers, digital needs, digital tools and their dependencies. Practical examples of such dependencies are given, which are formed under the influence of systematic missile attacks of the aggressor on the power energy system of Ukraine. The foundation was laid for a combined digital resilience assessment methodology that includes a metric approach and the theory of topological spaces.
