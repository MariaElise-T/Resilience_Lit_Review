An effective, timely managed and interoperable governance process and its adaptive features are of the utmost importance in dealing with any type of crisis at the state level. This article explores civil society actors’ engagement in Lithuania to identify the functional resilience level in crisis governance of COVID-19. Social capital and adaptive capacity approaches were employed for theoretical consideration and analysis. We hypothesise that linking social capital is more important for enhancing resilience at the beginning of the crisis, while adaptive capacity gains prominence during and after the crisis. Mixed analysis methods were used in gathering data through content analysis, surveys (standardised questionnaires) and interviews with experts from civic (voluntary and non-governmental) and public (local and central government) sectors. The findings provide novel insights into the importance of civil society actors’ engagement in bolstering functional resilience and embedment of a whole of society approach in crisis governance during times of uncertainty.
