Abstract
The resilience of mild steel to electrochemical degeneration in weak electrolyte corrosion (0.5 M HCl) was assessed at discrete concentrations of Norcholine derivatives by potentiodynamic polarization and open circuit potential analysis. Degradation rate of the steel substantially declined with augmentation of Norcholine concentration from 9.49 mm/y in control HCl (no Norcholine) to 0.27 mm/y at highest Norcholine value of 15%. The degradation rate at this inhibitor concentration correlates of 97.1% protection performance. Norcholine demonstrated cathodic inhibition effect from observation of the negative deviation in corrosion potential. Norcholine was also observed to indicate substantial passive reaction mechanism on the anodic polarization regions of the polarization graphs. This translates to evolution of non-porous layer on the steel exterior. Open circuit potential graphs indicate substantial variation between the inhibited and acid degraded graphs of the steel. Mathematical computations through analysis of variance demonstrates Norcholine concentration and potential tracking time are statistically important variation sources influencing the protection performance of Norcholine at values of 68.03% and 26.4%.
