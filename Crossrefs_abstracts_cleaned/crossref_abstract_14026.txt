Abstract
Indonesia is located at the meeting point of three tectonic plates, making it at-risk to geological disasters such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Earthquake disaster can cause a variety of crucial dangers, such as earthquakes, landslides, liquefaction, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, as one took place in Palu City in 2018. This study aims to identify key parameters that could increase Palu resilience in the face of calamity in the future. This study start with a literature review to determine the concept, parameters, and variables of resilience Palu City against disasters. These parameters and variables were then compared to the current condition. The findings of the literature review generated four main parameters for disaster-resilience cities: disaster risk reduction (improvement of infrastructure design and multi disasters-based land use planning), community recovery, efficient program implementation, and monitoring-evaluation. Furthermore, the comparison of these four parameters to reconstruction activities reveals that Palu cityâ€™s post-disaster reconstruction has not fully resulted in efforts to achieve the concept of a disaster-resilience city. This is because post-disaster management efforts in Indonesia are in accordance with applicable regulations, emphasizing recovery rather than mitigation in the following catastrophic events.
