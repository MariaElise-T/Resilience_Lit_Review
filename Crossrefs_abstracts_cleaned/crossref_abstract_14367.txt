AbstractAttachment resilience is the ability of attachment relationships to survive adversity and maintain their functions in the face of stress and is a critical component of personal and family resilience. This property is the result of interactive influences across multiple systems of care. In this way, security is transferred across what we call chains of security. This paper will delve into how family keyworkers (i.e., professionals who are referential and responsible for family intervention plans) function as a critical link within these chains of security for hard‐to‐reach families: first, through attachment‐like relationships that foster attachment resilience within families that are vulnerable or face adversity, and second, as receptors and transmitters of security by means of attachment‐centered supervision. Sensitivity, repair, and mentalization are highlighted as key processes constant across these multisystemic levels.
