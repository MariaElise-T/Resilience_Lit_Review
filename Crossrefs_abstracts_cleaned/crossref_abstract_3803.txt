 The stiffness of bituminous mixes is an important indicator of mix performance and a required input for mechanistic pavement design. Resilient modulus is one of many stiffness indicators of mixes which can be determined using laboratory testing methods or non-destructive field tests such as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests through back calculation. In this paper, two Manitoba mixes known as Bituminous B (Bit B) and Bituminous C (Bit C) are analysed using laboratory testing and FWD back calculation. The experiment involved samples from eight paving sites. Each site included two side-by-side sections having a common Bit B surface course over either a Bit B or a Bit C binder course. Cored samples were tested following the guidelines of the long term pavement performance protocol P07 at 5, 25, and 40 Â°C. The modulus of each layer was also estimated from FWD deflection measurements. Findings include correlations between the various material and test parameters and a comparison between back calculated and laboratory stiffnesses.Key words: falling weight deflectometer, indirect tensile test, resilient modulus, asphalt concrete.
