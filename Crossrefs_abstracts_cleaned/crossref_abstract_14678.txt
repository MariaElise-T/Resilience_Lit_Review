Abstract
        The aim of the paper is to analyse if and in which way specialization, geographical localization and spill-over effects affect resilience. The research is carried out using LLMAs (Local Labor Market Areas) as observational unit and spatial data analysis techniques (Anselin 1999, LeSage &amp; Pace, 2009) in Italy. Resilience literature focalized its attention on regions. Despite this, there is no general agreement regarding the most appropriate observation unit. Our aim is not only to investigate the relationship between specialization and resilience at smaller scale using the LLMAs as observation unit but also to explore the spatial relationship among them. Results highlight a strong spatial correlation among LLMAs. As consequence resilience is not only influenced by specialization but also by geographical localization through spill-over effects.
