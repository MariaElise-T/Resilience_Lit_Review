In this study, ten cities from the Visegrád countries are compared applying cross-sectional data (from the year 2015). After the standardization process of the involved 11 indicators, their adaptive capacity is measured by resilient index that we developed and a rank is created. This index is formed by three components (demographic, social-economic and spatial-environmental resilience components). Significant differences were revealed related to the adaptive capacity of the examined settlements. In spite of the fact that the capitals of the Visegrád countries are the most resilient cities from an economic perspective, their results are around or below the average regarding their demographic and spatial-environmental components. This indicates that the economic success of a city does not necessarily imply greater resilience: being an economically successful city is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a resilient city.
