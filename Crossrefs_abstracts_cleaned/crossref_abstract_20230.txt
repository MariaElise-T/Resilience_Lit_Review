This study was conducted on 100 hairdressers in the Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area on the American East Coast, By studying the relationship between work-life balance, job resilience, and job satisfaction, the study sought to find ways to improve the job satisfaction of hairdressers. The purpose of the study was individually explained to the subjects, and the survey was conducted using Google Form for those who agreed to participate. The specific results of data analysis based on the responses are as follows.
Most subjects worked 4-5 days a week, and the most common daily working hours were 8 hours, followed by over 9 hours, over 5 hours, less than 8 hours, and less than 4 hours, which showed that the working hours were relatively free compared to Korea. The salary level was 1.5 times higher than the Korean average.
The subjects' work-life balance and job resilience showed a significant positive correlation, and work-life balance and job satisfaction also showed a positive correlation. Job resilience and job satisfaction also showed a statistically significant positive correlation, and it was found that the higher work-life balance and job recovery resilience, the higher job satisfaction (p<.001). Additionally, the impact on job satisfaction was related to work-life balance and job recovery resilience.
Therefore, in order to fulfill the job satisfaction of hairdressers, priority must be given to improving the work environment or working conditions that can improve work-life balance. If work-life balance is met, mental and physical fatigue caused by work is reduced, and job satisfaction can be achieved. In the follow-up research, it is hoped that an in-depth qualitative study of hairdressers will be conducted based on this study results, and efforts to find the specific ways to improve work-life balance will be made.
