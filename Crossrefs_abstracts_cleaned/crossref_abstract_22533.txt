This study examines the sociocultural resilience to flash floods among the agrarian communities in Kuh-e-Suliman range. The researchers employed an ethnographic research design and used in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and participant observations to collect qualitative data. The study found how the local people act as a social group and use their indigenous knowledge to respond to the flash floods. They mobilize their social capital such as the local networks, alliances and natural resources for ensuring their survival in the face of natural disaster. Sociocultural obligations are religiously followed by the community members at the time of crisis that help them develop resilience against the flash floods.
