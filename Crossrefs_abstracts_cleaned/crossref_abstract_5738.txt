The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has caused a serious stigma in China. The purpose of this study was to explore the stigma in China against the background of COVID-19 and analyze its causes. This study also explores the negative consequences of trauma caused by stigma on people. Moreover, it explored the reasons for wound relief and identified the elements of resilience. Through analysis of existing relevant literature, it was found that the stigmatization phenomenon in China during COVID-19 was mainly targeted at people, patients, and medical staff in areas with severe epidemic situations. The main reasons for the emergence of stigma are improper information content used in mass media reporting and social media dissemination. The impact of trauma on people is in terms of self-identity and self-esteem, self-behaviour, and physical and mental health. Finally, the main factors contributing to resilience are family support, policy support, and personal regulation.
