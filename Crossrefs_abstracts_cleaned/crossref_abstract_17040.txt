Food systems scholars and practitioners are increasingly prioritizing food system resilience (FSR) as a conceptual framework. FSR has been the guiding topic of an ongoing partnership between the University of Vermont (UVM) and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM), involving faculty, graduate students, and commu­nity partners from both regions to collaborate on research, education, and outreach. The first major output of the UVM-UPRM partnership is a Food Resilience Toolkit developed by faculty and gradu­ate students at both universities, available in written and video formats in both English and Spanish. This research brief provides the results of an application of one component of the toolkit, an asset mapping exercise. We analyzed the results using the community capitals framework to highlight areas of strength and areas in need of investment. We found Vermont has assets to apply to FSR, with built, human, and social capital assets most numerous, while financial and political assets are fewest. We conclude with recommendations which can be vetted in future stakeholder gatherings and a call to apply the toolkit elsewhere.
