Science and practice focused on child resilience and family resilience have deep and intertwined roots, yet there have been surprisingly few efforts to systematically integrate the theory, findings, and implications of these two traditions of work. In this article, the authors discuss parallels in concepts and processes that link the sciences of child and family resilience and the potential of relational developmental systems theory to provide an integrative framework for understanding and promoting resilience in children and families. The authors describe components of an integrated approach to child and family resilience, highlighting examples from recent research, and discuss implications for research, practice, and professional training.
