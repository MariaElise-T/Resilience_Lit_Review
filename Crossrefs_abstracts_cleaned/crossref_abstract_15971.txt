AbstractAimThe aim was to investigate the associations of activities of daily living, resilience and the well‐being among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and provide a long‐term follow‐up study.DesignA longitudinal design was used.MethodsThe instruments included the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) Scale to assess the activities of daily living as well as the Resilience Scale and Well‐Being Scale. A regression analysis was used to predict the factors related to well‐being. A repeated‐measures ANOVA was used for long‐term follow‐up with regard to IADLs, resilience and well‐being.ResultsA total of 105 eligible participants were enrolled, of whom 59% were men and 41% were women. Interactions at three time points among IADLs, resilience, and well‐being were reported. IADLs were significantly and positively associated with resilience and well‐being. Resilience was a significant predictor of well‐being. The well‐being score increased by 0.24 points for every 1‐point increase in the resilience score.ConclusionIADLs, resilience, and well‐being are correlated in patients with CKD, and resilience is a predictor of well‐being. Higher resilience is associated with higher well‐being. Therefore, clinical care providers need to access the resilience level of CKD patients as early as possible and design appropriate interventions to improve mental health and quality of life.
