PurposeThis study addresses resilient mixed supply chain network design (SCND) and aims to minimize the expected total cost of the supply chain (SC) considering disruptions. The capacity of facilities is considered uncertain. In order to get closer to real-world situations, competition between SCs is considered.Design/methodology/approachA two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for designing the SC network. The location of facilities and selection of suppliers are considered first-stage decisions, and the determination of materials and products flows are second-stage decisions. Some resilience strategies are applied to mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions.FindingsThe results indicate that considering resilience and applying the related strategies are vitally important, and resilience strategies can significantly improve the SC objective and maintain market share. Also, it is confirmed that unrealistic decisions will be made without considering the competition.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by proposing a novel mathematical model for the resilient mixed SCND problem. The other contribution is considering the chain-to-chain competition in collecting returned products and selling recycled products to other SCs in a mixed SC under disruptions. Also, a novel hybrid metaheuristic is developed to cope with the complexity of the model.
