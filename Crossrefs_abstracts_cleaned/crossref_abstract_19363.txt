AbstractRecently, due to the increase of the frequency of high impact low probability (HILP) events (manmade and natural events), assessment and enhancement of resilience has become very important in the operation and planning procedures of future power systems. In this regard, several researches have been conducted on operation and planning strategies of the power system to improve resilience. Here, assessment and enhancement approaches of power system resilience by focusing on the role of wind farms and wind turbines are reviewed. To do so, a comprehensive review of the related metrics, hazard types, modelling approaches, assessment methods, and enhancement solutions is presented. Then, the assessment and enhancement methods of power system resilience are categorized in three phases before event (preventive proactive actions), during event (corrective active actions) and after event (restorative reactive actions) from the point of view of operation and planning actions. Finally, the current challenges, research gaps and future trends are discussed.
