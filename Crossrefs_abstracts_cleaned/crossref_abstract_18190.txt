Introduction. Resilience is the capacity in which the qualities and resources of the individual help in the successful coping of adverse situations. Studying the construct of resilience requires seeing it as a process and not only a characteristic of the individual. Saavedra's resilient response is a model that fits this idea and explains resilience satisfactorily. Having a measuring instrument for health personnel working in hospitals would allow discovering its benefits as a protective factor in the workplace. Objective. Adapt and validate the Resilience Scale SV-RES in hospital health professionals in Mexico. Method. Based on recent research literature, including response models and modified and adapted items from the Resilience Scale SV-RES, a total of 909 health professionals responded. Distribution, factor analysis, and internal consistency tests were performed. Results. The process led to a scale of 28 items grouped into six factors with an overall internal consistency of (Î± = .908) and 50.5% of explained variance. Discussion and conclusion. The Resilience Scale SV-RES has adequate psychometric properties that make it appropriate to measure the resilience capacity of hospital health professionals in Mexico.
