 The economic development and increasing population have intensified the demand for mineral products and have led to environmental disasters in mining cities around the world. This paper discusses environmental risks in mining cities by analysing the current situation of environmental disasters that occur at home and abroad. The study draws on the theory of urban resilience and analyses the influencing factors of disastrous occurrence in mining areas. By putting forward the resilience evaluation index system this paper aims to improve the cities’ ability to cope with major shocks and chronic stress, and to enhance urban resistance and resilience. The study of urban resilience capacity against uncertain risks involves ecological and engineering resilience, and economic and social resilience. With reference to the statistics of Tangshan city, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation, using the cluster analysis method, to calculate the degree of urban resilience and resilience index. The paper also attempts to put forward optimisation statistics for greater capacity of resilience to be achieved in the future urban development process, while providing a basis for improving the mining cities’ capability to resist disasters and maintain sustainable development in those places.
