Abstract
As the global climate continues to change and environmental damage has intensified, it has seriously affected the safety and sustainable development of coastal cities. Improving the resilience of coastal cities has become their strategic consensus to respond to changes. Based on the theory of resilient cities, using complex network analysis methods and taking reliability analysis as the starting point, a coastal road resilience evaluation system was constructed, and the impact analysis and resilience evaluation were carried out using Yantai City as an example. The results show that: 1) Yantai municipal road network (national and provincial road) has high reliability and strong robustness; 2) the network has important road sections with greater influence. Based on this, this article proposes strategies for improving urban resilience.
