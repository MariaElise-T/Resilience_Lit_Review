Introduction: The present study aimed to examine a proposed model for the relationship between resilience and emotional reactions to failure, mediated by self-compassion and Emotion Regulation (ER) among martial artists. Materials and Methods: A total of 286 athletes (191 males & 95 females; Mean±SD age: 20.98±3.30 years) from different disciplines of martial arts (taekwondo, karate, Judo, & wushu) engaged in league championship participated in the study. Athletes completed the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). The proposed model was evaluated using structural equation modeling. Results: The obtained results revealed that resilience has direct and indirect effects on emotional reactions to failure. Furthermore, self-compassion and maladaptive ER play a partial negative mediating role between resilience and emotional reactions to failure. However, the mediating role of adaptive ER was not significant. Conclusion: The study data predicted negative emotional reactions to failure based on resilience, mediated by self-compassion and ER among martial artists; thus, these data indicate the necessity of paying attention to the development of resilience in martial artists. This method emphasizes self-compassion and the reduction of maladaptive ER for better recovery of failure and reduces its effects.
