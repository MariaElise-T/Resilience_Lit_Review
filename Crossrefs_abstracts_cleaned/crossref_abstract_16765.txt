Abstract Objective: To identify studies on resilience in the elderly measured by the Connor-Davidson scale. Method: A systematic review of literature on the level of resilience of the elderly was carried out, based on articles indexed in the Lilacs, IBECS, MedLine and PubMed databases, according to the Prisma method. Results: 27 studies were identified which included the elderly in their samples and determined the level of resilience through the Connor-Davidson scale. The USA (6), China (6) and Australia (5) had the greatest number of articles. A study carried out with elderly people in Australia had the highest level of resilience, which was attributed to public policies that favor the resilience development capacity of the population. The lowest level of resilience was observed in Japan in a study with survivors of major natural disasters, highlighting resilience as a significant protective factor for elderly persons who experience such events during their lives. Conclusion: The studies recognize resilience as an important protective factor for coping with external adversities and natural events, whether arising from the effects of the aging process on health, or through disease.
