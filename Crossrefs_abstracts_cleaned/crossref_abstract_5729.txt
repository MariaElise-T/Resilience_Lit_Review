Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant increase in stress for frontline healthcare workers, including rehabilitation workers. Contributing factors include disrupted workflows, heavier workloads, increased time restraints, and fear of contracting/passing the virus. Prolonged high stress levels can produce adverse health outcomes when unaddressed. Resilience can mitigate the negative effects of prolonged stress. Four healthcare workers relate their experiences from the frontlines of the pandemic, discussing their strategies to build resilience and maintain health. Highlighted strategies include mindfulness (the purposeful act of paying attention to the present moment without judgment), gratitude (the practice of being grateful for the positive things in life), self-care (the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle using physical, psychological, and emotional tools), and social support (the sense of belonging that comes from being cared for and valued). These strategies reduce negative outcomes produced by elevated stress levels and promote resilience in frontline healthcare workers.
