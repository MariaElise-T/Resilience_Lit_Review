Farmers are socially isolated, working for long hours without any opportunity for social interaction, which can lead to loneliness and poor mental health (Skerratt, 2018). The present study aimed to assess the relationship between perceived social support and resilience among farmers. For this purpose, a sample of 230 farmers aged 35-50 years was selected from various rural areas of Punjab. Results revealed a significant positive relationship between perceived social support and resilience. This finding has implications for mental health counsellors in enhancing resilience among farmers by highlighting the role of social support through family counselling and awareness campaigns. Families of farmers need to be educated with regards to their role in providing social support to the farmers in the face of difficult times, and farmers need psychoeducation about seeking social support without hesitation or inhibitions.Â
