AbstractOnly‐child loss parents in China recently gained extensive attention as a newly defined social group. Resilience could be a probable solution out of the psychological dilemma. Using a sample of 185 only‐child loss people, this study employed latent class analysis (a) to explore whether different classes of resilience could be identified, (b) to determine socio‐demographic characteristics of each class, and (c) to compare the depression and the subjective well‐being of each class. The results supported a three‐class solution, defined as ‘high tenacity‐strength but moderate optimism class’, ‘moderate resilience but low self‐efficacy class’ and ‘low tenacity but moderate adaption‐dependence class’. Parents with low income and medical insurance of low reimbursement type and without endowment insurance occupied more proportions in the latter two classes. The latter two classes also had a significant higher depression scores and lower subjective well‐being scores than high tenacity‐strength but moderate optimism class. Future work should care those socio‐economically vulnerable bereaved parents, and an elastic economic assistance policy was needed. To develop targeted resilience interventions, the emphasis of high tenacity‐strength but moderate optimism class should be the optimism. Moderate resilience but low self‐efficacy class should be self‐efficacy, and low tenacity but moderate adaption‐dependence class should be tenacity.
