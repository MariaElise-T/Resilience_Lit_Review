Background The evolution of technology has contributed to the way people communicate with each other; however, it exposes individuals to cyberbullying which has become widespread across many societies. Despite the increased attention given to this internet-related problem, little efforts have been made in non-Western societies like Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the direct impact of cyberbullying victimisation and resilience on depression among students and to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between cyberbullying victimisation and depression. Methods A quantitative survey approach was employed to collect data from 353 undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of the Cyber-Victim dimension from the Cyberbullying Test, the Resilience Scale (RS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted using AMOS version 26 to test the hypotheses. Results The findings from the structural model showed that cyberbullying victimisation had a significant and negative direct effect on resilience. Cyberbullying victimisation also had a significant and positive direct effect on depression, while there was a significant and negative direct effect of resilience on depression. The study further found that resilience significantly mediated the relationship between cyberbullying victimisation and depression. Conclusions This study is significant as it is a pioneering work in Saudi Arabia that examines the relationship between cyberbullying victimisation, resilience, and depression among undergraduate students. The findings of this study can help tackle depression among students by increasing resilience when faced with cyberbullying victimisation.
