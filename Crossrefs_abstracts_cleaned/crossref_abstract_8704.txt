AbstractAchieving success in one's career has numerous positive consequences for individuals as well as for organizations. This study examines the influence of emotional intelligence measures on career success. Also, using the broaden and build theory, we propose employee resilience as an underlying mechanism connecting emotional intelligence measures and career success. Data were collected from employees working in different IT organizations in India's northern region. Confirmatory factor analysis followed by path analysis using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method in AMOS was performed. Results found that all the emotional intelligence measures directly affect career success and employee resilience. For instance, the adaptability dimension had the most significant direct impact on career success, whereas the interpersonal dimension emerged as the leading predictor of resilience among all five emotional intelligence dimensions. In addition, employee resilience was identified as a partial mediator between all emotional intelligence measures and career success. The present study offers some insightful theoretical and practical implications.
