Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to personal growth that occurs after experiencing challenges. For many nursing students, PTG could occur during their clinical practice. Academic motivation and resilience could help students to overcome these traumatic clinical experiences and possibly achieve PTG. This study examined the relationships between nursing students’ academic motivation and resilience leading to post-traumatic growth. A total of 291 nursing students from three South Korean nursing colleges participated in this cross-sectional study. Self-report questionnaire data were analyzed using t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions. Intrinsically motivated students’ PTG scores were significantly higher compared to extrinsically motivated students (t = 4.62, p < 0.001). Resilience scores showed similar results (t = 3.81, p < 0.001). Significant total, direct, and indirect effects of academic motivation on resilience and PTG were found. In addition, resilience mediated 40.9% of the relationship between academic motivation and PTG. Nursing students with intrinsic academic motivation were more likely to achieve high PTG scores, and resilience mediated the relationship between academic motivation and PTG. It is suggested that the importance of academic motivation must be considered in the early stages of university-level nursing education to increase retention rates of nursing students.
