Abstract‘Resilience CL+’ (Reg. no. CV‐1176, PI 686413; PVP 201800104) is a soft white common winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar carrying two‐gene tolerance to imazamox herbicide that was developed and released in October 2016 by the Agricultural Research Center of Washington State University. It was tested under the experimental designations KCF9002 and WA 8187. Resilience CL+ was developed using marker‐assisted background selection and marker‐assisted forward breeding approaches involving a cross between a soft white winter wheat cultivar ‘Madsen’ and CL0618 (an Australian hard red spring two‐gene Clearfield line). Resilience CL+ carries two mutation alleles (Als1 and Als2) of the acetolactate synthase gene (ALS) located on chromosomes 6DL and 6BL. Resilience CL+ has high grain‐yield potential, intermediate plant height, and is well adapted to regions of the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) with >500 mm of annual precipitation. Resilience CL+ exhibited herbicide tolerance equivalent to ‘AP503 CL2’ and greater than the single‐gene Clearfield cultivar ‘ORCF‐102’. Compared with the other Clearfield cultivars grown in the PNW, Resilience CL+ has a high level of resistance to stripe rust and foot rot resistance, similar to that of Madsen. Resilience CL+ has soft kernels, an excellent milling score, and good end‐use quality characteristics. Yield comparison of Resilience CL+ with other popular cultivars demonstrated that it has greater yield than ‘SY Ovation’ and Madsen but is similar to ORCF‐102.
