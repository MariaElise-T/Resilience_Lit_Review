AbstractThis paper addresses the issue of frequency recovery in distributed battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and the balancing of the state of charge (SOC) after secondary control inputs have been subjected to false data injection attacks (FDI). A fuzzy high order differentiator (FHOD) observer based distributed resilient control is introduced with the aim of achieving frequency restoration and power adaptive allocation. In order to mitigate the performance degradation caused by the chattering of traditional sliding mode observers, a high order differentiator (HOD) is employed as an observer. By introducing fuzzy control logic to optimize the coefficients of the differentiator, the coefficient of the proposed differentiator is adjusted based on the tracking error, thereby reducing the transient overshoot of the observer when the attack signal changes, which approach effectively balances the response speed and observation accuracy. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that the suggested control strategy is able to mitigate the effects caused by complex and unbounded FDI attacks on the BESSs and exhibits superior transient performance compared to traditional HOD observer in response to changes in attack signal.
