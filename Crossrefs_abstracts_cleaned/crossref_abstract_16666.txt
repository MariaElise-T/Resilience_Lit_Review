AbstractThe purpose of this study was to identify the personality predictors of individuals with a stress coping style. In the study, we have attempted to establish which traits play a crucial role in the prediction of tendencies applicable to a specific style of stress coping. In this study, all personality predictors were included in one model. The study was conducted with a group of 632 students. The results demonstrate a positive relationship between both self-efficacy and resilience with a task-oriented style of coping. Both traits related to a task-oriented style to a similar extent. The relationship between participants’ sense of coherence and task-oriented style was non-significant. Participants’ emotion-oriented style was negatively related with not just the sense of coherence variable, but also with self-efficacy and resilience. Significant predictors of avoidance-oriented styles were the sense of coherence and resilience variables. Further analysis of the two forms of avoidance-oriented styles demonstrate that the sense of coherence variable was a significant predictor of both engaging in substitute activities and seeking contact with other people. Resilience was a significant predictor solely with regard to seeking contact with other people.
