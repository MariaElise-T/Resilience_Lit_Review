ObjectiveMost reactions to loss can be characterized by three prototypical trajectories of resilience, gradual recovery, and chronic distress (Bonanno, ). However, research on the factors that uniquely predict these trajectories of response has been limited. We examined theoretically relevant predictors of each of the trajectory patterns.MethodWe assessed 115 bereaved spouses at 1.5 to 3 years postloss and 74 married controls. To identify grief trajectory, we provided bereaved participants with a graphical depiction of the trajectories and asked them to select the one that best described their experience.ResultsGroup comparisons revealed substantial differences between resilient and prolonged grievers, and almost no differences between resilient and married controls. Multivariate analyses indicated that prolonged grief, when compared to resilience, was uniquely associated with maladaptive dependency traits, difficulty accessing positive memories of the deceased, and higher recalled marital adjustment.ConclusionThe present results extend our understanding of factors associated with distinct trajectories of adjustment after loss.
