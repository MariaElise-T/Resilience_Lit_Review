AbstractMicroanalyzed global parent interview variables that had previously differentiated stress‐resilient (SR) and stress‐affected (SA) outcomes in independent samples (4th–6th and 2nd–3rd grade) of multiethnic, highly stressed, urban children. The in‐depth interview assessed caregiving environment and early child development. On item‐level t tests for the pooled sample, 36 of 144 items differentiated the groups. Discriminant function analysis identified a cluster of nine sensitive items that correctly classified 81.7% of children as SR or SA. Factor analysis of the 36 items identified a 4‐factor solution: Child Adjustment, Early Temperament, Parent‐Child Relationship, and Developmental Milestones; SR parents exceeded SAs on each. Structurally comparable analyses using only Sample 2 and including the second interview's new measures, replicated and extended findings from the pooled sample. Overall, study findings enhance understanding of resilience and testify to the merit of using a microanalytic approach in this research area. Implications for streamlining existing measures and for future research directions are considered. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
