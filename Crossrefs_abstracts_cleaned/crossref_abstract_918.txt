 The primary aim of this study was to identify factors associated with resiliency in poor single-parent families. A cross-sectional survey was used to identify and describe resiliency factors that enable families to maintain healthy family functioning. The 51 families that participated in this study were identified by the nature of the crisis and the developmental phase of the family. A biographical questionnaire and several indexes were completed independently by a parent and a child from each family. The results indicated a significant relationship between the familiesâ€™ adaptation and intrafamilial support, support from family and friends, family hardiness, a positive approach to problems, and religion. The findings can contribute significantly to future interventions and preventive approaches to foster resiliency in families.
