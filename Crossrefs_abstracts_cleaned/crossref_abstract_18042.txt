To effectively adapt to changing environments, plants must maintain a delicate balance between growth and resistance or tolerance to various stresses. Nitrate, a significant inorganic nitrogen source in soils, not only acts as an essential nutrient but also functions as a critical signaling molecule that regulates multiple aspects of plant growth and development. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in understanding nitrate sensing, calcium-dependent nitrate signal transmission, and nitrate-induced transcriptional cascades. Mounting evidence suggests that the primary response to nitrate is influenced by environmental conditions, while nitrate availability plays a pivotal role in stress tolerance responses. Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of key components in the nitrate signaling pathway, namely, NRT1.1, NLP7, and CIPK23, under abiotic stresses. Additionally, we discuss the specificity of nitrate sensing and signaling as well as the involvement of epigenetic regulators. A comprehensive understanding of the integration between nitrate signaling transduction and abiotic stress responses is crucial for developing future crops with enhanced nitrogen-use efficiency and heightened resilience.
