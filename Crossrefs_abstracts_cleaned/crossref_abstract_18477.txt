This study offers an analytical portrayal of the resilience that learning management systems (LMSs) provide to higher education institutions. It analyzes the previous literature on various educational settings during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the LMS adoption process, followed by a focus on Qatar Universityâ€™s adoption of Blackboard and how this offered a smooth transition to online and blended learning during the pandemic. The main purpose of this research is to provide an overview of how the effective adoption of a LMS by higher education institutions can enhance the resilience of the teaching-learning process in a changing educational landscape. A qualitative case study is conducted to present the process Qatar University went through to adopt Blackboard in its educational system, followed by an examination of the impact of this adoption on resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. This case study is conducted through a qualitative content analysis of the resources available on the official Qatar University website, including information from the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) and Student Learning Support Center (SLSC), other sources on the website such as newsletters and announcements, and datasets provided by CETL. The research employs the theory of diffusion of innovation to evaluate the effectiveness of the adoption of Blackboard. The value of this paper lies in establishing a link between the LMS adoption process and its role in overcoming academic disturbances. The limitations and recommendations are considered.
