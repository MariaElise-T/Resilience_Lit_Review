AbstractResilient modulus (Mr) of subgrade soils is one of the crucial inputs in pavement structural design methods. However, the spatial variability of soil properties and the nature of test protocols, the laboratory determination of Mr has become inexpedient. This paper aims to design an accurate soft computing technique for the prediction of Mr of subgrade soils using the hybrid least square support vector machine (LSSVM) approaches. Six swarm intelligence algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), symbiotic organisms search (SOS), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), slime mould algorithm (SMA), and Harris hawks optimization (HHO) have been applied and compared to optimize the LSSVM parameters. For this purpose, a literature dataset (891 datasets) of different types of soils has been used to design and evaluate the proposed models. The input variables in all of the proposed models included confining stress, deviator stress, unconfined compressive strength, degree of soil saturation, soil moisture content, optimum moisture content, plasticity index, liquid limit, and percent of soil particles (P #200). The accuracy of the proposed models was assessed by comparing the predicted with the observed of Mr values with respect to different statistical analyses, i.e., root means square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2). For modeling the Mr of subgrade soils, percent passing No. 200 sieve, optimum moisture content, and unconfined compressive strength were found to be the most significant variables. It is observed that the performance of LSSVM-GWO, LSSVM-SOS, and LSSVM-SSA outperforms other models in predicting accurate values of Mr. The (RMSE and R2) of the LSSVM-GWO, LSSVM-SSA, and LSSVM-SOS are (6.79 MPa and 0.940), (6.78 MPa and 0.940), and (6.72 MPa and 0.942), respectively, and hence, LSSVM-SOS can be used for high estimating accuracy of Mr of subgrade soils.
