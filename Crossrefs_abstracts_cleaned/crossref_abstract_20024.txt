 The aim of this study was to ascertain patients' quality of life and resilience related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) after treatment with platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy drugs. A self-administered questionnaire combining the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3), the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and the resilience scale RS-14TM was posted to a non-probability sample of 100 patients who had recently completed treatment with a platinum- or taxane-based drug. In total, 86 completed questionnaires were returned (86% response rate). Participants rated their overall quality of life and overall health over the previous week. The combined global health status score was 70, indicating that participants had a relatively high health status. Similar to the scores on the EORTC QLQ-30, scores for the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 showed that the majority of participants indicated experiencing very little impact (not at all, a little) on sensory, motor and autonomic scales. However, motor scale items were generally rated lower than items concerning sensory functioning. The study results are an encouraging indication of minimal impact on quality of life when treatment with taxanes and platinums ended. The results also indicate that resilience scores among the participants were moderately high.
