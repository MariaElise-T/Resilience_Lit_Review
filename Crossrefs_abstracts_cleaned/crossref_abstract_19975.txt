AbstractAimsThe aim of this study was to explore the role stressors experienced by executive nurse directors and strategies employed to maintain resilience.BackgroundRecent financial pressures on and care quality scandals in the UK NHS impact on the work of executive nurse directors. The short length of tenure and the high number of vacancies for these posts point to the exacting demands of the role and raise questions about the support mechanisms available for the most senior nurses in NHS organizations.DesignA grounded constructivist study.MethodsSemi‐structured telephone interviews conducted between February–July, 2014.ResultsStressors were both chronic (workload, lack of corporate responsibility for quality, reductions in quality team staffing, tensions between financial solvency and care quality and personal vulnerability) and acute (dealing with complaints and major incidents). Resilience required the support of fellow executives, peers, family and mentors and could be enhanced by self‐discipline, good preparation for the post and ongoing coaching.ConclusionRecent fiscal austerity and scandals relating to quality of care have increased pressure on executive nurse directors. Increasing size of organizations, limited resources devoted to quality combined with poorly defined limits of responsibility are all major stressors and executive nurse directors, both in the United Kingdom and internationally, need clear strategies to maintain resilience. Repetitive demands for data by oversight organizations may detract from more important quality assurance strategies.
