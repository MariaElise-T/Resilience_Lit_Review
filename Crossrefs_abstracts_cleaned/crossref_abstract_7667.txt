 Granular materials are widely used for bases or subbases in pavement structures. They typically exhibit strong anisotropic properties which relate to stress states and particle characteristics. The conventional design procedure for flexible pavements underestimates the anisotropy of resilient moduli. This study established an anisotropic resilient modulus model for granular materials that considered gradation and particle shape characteristics. Vertical and horizontal resilient moduli of certain granular materials were measured in self-developed triaxial tests to obtain corresponding model parameters and anisotropic coefficients. Gradation and particle shape models were established to quantify the granular material characteristics, and the parameters were regressed. Particle shapes were obtained via image processing, and the ratio ( η) of particle sphericity to roundness was chosen as a shape parameter. Results show that η increases with the decrease in particle size, and the average values of η for graded gravel and natural laterite are 0.54 and 0.63, respectively. The η distribution curves indicate that the proportion of relatively anisotropic particles, rather than extremely anisotropic particles, results in the differences in particle shape characteristics. The regression relationship between the anisotropic calculation parameters and the model parameters of vertical resilient modulus, gradation, and particle shape was established. Thus, the horizontal resilient modulus and the anisotropic coefficient can be predicted via conventional resilient modulus tests and gradation, and particle shape analysis. This study shows that the anisotropy of granular materials decreases with the increase in coarse particles and the uniformization of the particle size distribution, and it increases with the increase in anisotropic particles and the polarization of the η distribution.
