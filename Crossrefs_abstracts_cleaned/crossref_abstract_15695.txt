 Resilience is a term that refers to a person’s ability to successfully adapt to adversity. Resilience research has been relatively limited with older adults, particularly with older American Indians. Also, none of the resilience measures have been validated in older American Indians. This study’s objective was to assess the psychometric properties of the full 25-item and abbreviated 10-item versions of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) with a sample of older American Indians. Both CD-RISC versions performed similarly in the study sample compared with what has been reported in other populations. The full version demonstrated adequate internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity, but a meaningful factor structure was not confirmed. The abbreviated version showed good internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity and appeared to have a stable one-factor solution. These findings lend greater support to the use of the abbreviated version than the full version of the CD-RISC with older American Indians.
