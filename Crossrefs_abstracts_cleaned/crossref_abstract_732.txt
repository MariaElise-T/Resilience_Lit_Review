As researchers summarized their experiences with earthquake disasters, they found that the traditional seismic design concept of only regarding preventing collapse of structures under earthquake loads as the primary seismic defense objective for structures, has deficiencies in post-earthquake use and repair. Therefore, the concept of resilient structure design was proposed, which enables structures to quickly repair to pre-earthquake functional levels after earthquakes. Currently, the concept of resilience is gradually becoming the core theory of seismic design. This paper reviews the shortcomings of traditional seismic design concepts, introduces the two core objectives of resilient structure design, namely "reducing post-earthquake residual deformation" and "reducing post-earthquake structural damage and damage concentration." Resilient structures are mainly classified into rocking structures, structures with self-centering braced, and structures with replaceable member according to their implementation methods. The principles and research progress of these three structures are summarized. The deficiencies of existing building structural seismic performance are analyzed, and the reinforcement technology and practical engineering extension applications of the resilience concept in the reinforcement of existing structures are introduced. The prospects of the resilience concept in interdisciplinary research, post-disaster structural damage analysis, practical engineering applications, and other aspects are proposed.
