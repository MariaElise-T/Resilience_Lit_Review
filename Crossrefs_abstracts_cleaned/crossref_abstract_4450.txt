Resilient business enterprises are able to survive strategic disruptions like technology disruptions and come back as more successful. They succeed because they have resilient characteristics and apply resilience strategies. Based on a case study analysis, this paper builds a business enterprise resilience model that guides the business enterprises to build the resilience capabilities that enable them to survive during strategic disruptions. The proposed model guides the business enterprise to instil in its architecture the design characteristics of resilience that make it ready to respond to disruption. The model uses the resilience strategies of mitigation, adaptation, and transformation and applies them at three enterprise levels; the operating model level, the competitive strategy level, and the business model level. The mitigation strategy moves the operating model to the efficiency frontier. The adaption strategy recovers the enterprise from the impacts of the strategic disruptions. The transformation strategy transforms the enterprise business model totally.
