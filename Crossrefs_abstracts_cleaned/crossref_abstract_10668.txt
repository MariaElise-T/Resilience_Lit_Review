When planning and managing the present-day and future transformed electric power systems (EPS), such comparatively new properties as flexibility and cyber resilience shall be taken into account along with EPS conventional properties, such as Reliability, Security, Survivability, and Vulnerability. Large-scale introduction of renewable energy sources notably lowers the EPS flexibility. Installation of Energy Storages allows compensation of power production imbalance occurred when using renewable energy sources, which makes the energy system more robust, but lowers its cyber security. The paper considers the main performances and models of Energy Storages, their impact on flexibility and cyber security of electric networks; it also presents the technique for quantifying the flexibility of a network with Energy Storages, and identifies most promising directions of studies in this area.
