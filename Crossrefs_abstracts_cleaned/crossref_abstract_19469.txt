AbstractThis study was designed to examine the feasibility of analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) data from repeat-flier astronauts at matching days on two separate missions to assess any effect of repeated missions on brain plasticity and psychological resilience, as conjectured by Demertzi. As an example, on the second mission of a healthy astronaut studied about 20 days after launch, sleep duration lengthened, sleep quality improved, and spectral power (ms2) co-varying with activity of the salience network (SN) increased at night. HF-component (0.15–0.50 Hz) increased by 61.55%, and HF-band (0.30–0.40 Hz) by 92.60%. Spectral power of HRV indices during daytime, which correlate negatively with psychological resilience, decreased, HF-component by 22.18% and HF-band by 37.26%. LF-component and LF-band, reflecting activity of the default mode network, did not change significantly. During the second mission, 24-h acrophases of HRV endpoints did not change but the 12-h acrophase of TF-HRV did (P < 0.0001), perhaps consolidating the circadian system to help adapt to space by taking advantage of brain plasticity at night and psychological resilience during daytime. While this N-of-1 study prevents drawing definitive conclusions, the methodology used herein to monitor markers of brain plasticity could pave the way for further studies that could add to the present results.
