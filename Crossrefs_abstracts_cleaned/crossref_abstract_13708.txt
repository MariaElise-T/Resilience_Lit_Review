This article is part of the Research Topic ‘Health Systems Recovery in the Context of COVID-19 and Protracted Conflict'. The considerable human, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 have demonstrated a global lack of health system resilience, highlighting gaps in health system capacities due to fragmented approaches to health system financing, planning, and implementation. One of the key actions for ensuring equitable essential health services in all countries in normal situations as well as emergencies is through strengthening the primary healthcare (PHC) system. In the context of the unfolding pandemic, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) undertook a variety of strategic actions to ensure the sustainability of health services during the current health emergency and to promote health system resilience against future shocks. Right after the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978, MoHME pursued the PHC philosophy incorporating the principles within the WHO health system framework and its six building blocks. In response to the evolving pandemic, MoHME put in place several interventions to ensure the maintenance of essential health services in addition to the provision of response. Some interventions were new, informed by global experience with COVID-19, while others leveraged existing strengths within the existing health system. Those were taking a whole-of-government approach; leveraging the PHC capacity; supporting the workforce; strengthening preparedness and response; improving access to medicines, vaccines, and health products; and leveraging the health information system into the pandemic response. Health system strengthening that promotes resilience is imperative for governments as health systems are fundamental to sustainable socioeconomic development. In recognition of this, the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) has recently outlined regional priorities for advancing universal health coverage (UHC) and ensuring health security. Iran's approach both prior to and during the pandemic is strongly aligned with those regional priorities, which are “primary health care-oriented models; enhancing health workforce; promoting equity; enabling environment for research; improving access to countermeasures; and fostering health system resilience.”
