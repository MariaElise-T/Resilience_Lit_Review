PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine how the changing pattern of climatic conditions is likely to impact tourism in Small island developing states (SIDS). Further, the study suggests appropriate management practices that could help in tackling the consequences of climate change on the tourism sector in SIDS.Design/methodology/approachRecently published articles and reports are analysed in relation to the effects of climate change on the tourism sector, and approaches to improve the resilience of tourism in SIDS.FindingsThe study has discovered the likely effects of climate change on the tourism business and found a high possibility of a decline in the tourism-based economy as an outcome. Furthermore, the study found that the absence of institutional alliances, government backing, resilient policy and advanced technological mechanisms are driving the associated risks of climate change in tourism.Practical implicationsThe framework presented can assist tourism stakeholders to plan, prepare, mitigate and build resilience against the effects of climate variability on the tourism business in SIDS.Originality/valueThis study presents some practical measures for tourism stakeholders to enable them to reduce the effects of climate change on tourism activities in Small island developing states (SIDS).
