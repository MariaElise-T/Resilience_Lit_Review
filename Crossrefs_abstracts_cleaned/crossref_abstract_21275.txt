The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), organized a colloquium to survey the frontiers of hydrologic science. The overarching subjects of resilience and vulnerability of natural and managed hydrological systems to climate and land‐use change were explored in three main themes: advancing theory for hydrology and the critical zone (the near‐surface zone, where the hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere interact), coupling hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, and tools for advancing hydrologic science and environmental engineering. Fourteen sessions, with topics ranging from advanced instrumentation, nutrient dynamics, and catchment classification to predictability of hydrologic systems, were held under these themes with invited oral presentations followed by discussion periods and poster sessions. The colloquium was attended by more than 170 scientists from more than 100 different universities, research institutes, and government agencies.
