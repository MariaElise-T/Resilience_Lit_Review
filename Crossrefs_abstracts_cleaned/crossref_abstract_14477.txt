Abstract
Social work practitioners are called on to be resilient in an increasingly complex and challenging human service environment. This study presents the results of a systematic scoping review aimed at understanding the role of social work education in developing students’ professional resilience in preparation for their future social work practice. The application of a comprehensive search strategy resulted in the inclusion of thirty-two articles, published between 2008 and 2018. A descriptive thematic analysis highlighted the political and contextual influences on this recent and emerging body of literature, together with three key themes. These themes centred around education building resilience through screening social work applicants, targeted knowledge provision and inclusive educational processes. The findings draw attention to the emphasis on social workers being individually responsible and accountable for their professional resilience, with this potentially reinforced and facilitated through education processes. The findings identify the need for future research to investigate environmental influences on social workers’ resilience, including how educators support students to understand and shape them.
