This article deals with the problem of the relationship of resilience with the coping behaviour of young people. It justifies the idea that the adaptability and maladaptivity of coping strategies is related to the viability of the individual. Particular attention is paid to the comparative analysis of the coping repertoire of girls and young men with different levels of resilience. The interrelation of types of response to difficulties with the level of resilience is proved. The author comes to the conclusion that resilience involves a wide range of types of response, greater flexibility and ability to adapt behaviour to different situations. The article summarises some of the results of studying adaptive, non-adaptive andrelatively adaptive strategies depending on the level of viability and gender of the subjects. The specificity of communication between different types of coping strategies caused by difficult situations and the level of resilience in men and women from 18 to 35 years of age is discussed.
