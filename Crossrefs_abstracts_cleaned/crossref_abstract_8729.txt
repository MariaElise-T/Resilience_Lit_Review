Abstract
Resilience is important to the academic and career success of nursing students; however, the literature on nursing student resilience is sparse and remains undertheorized. This article describes nursing studentsâ€™ perspectives on sources of resilience during nursing school at one institution of higher learning. A constant comparative analysis of baccalaureate nursing student focus group responses was performed. Three themes emerged: negative experiences, supportive structures and relationships, and individual coping processes and abilities. Interrelationships between thematic findings highlight the centrality of supportive structures and relationships. Based on these findings, theoretical guidance for future nursing student resilience assessments and interventions is provided.
