Abstract
This article seeks to clarify the terminology and methods of planning to
                        avert hospital internal disaster. It differentiates “crisis” from “disaster”
                        in the in-hospital setting. Preparedness, as contrasted with mitigation, is
                        meant to reduce the likelihood that a crisis will turn into a disaster.
                        Though there are some recurring features of crises, allowing for
                        preparedness through the identification of a few high-likelihood
                        contingencies, crises are subject to numerous, overwhelming uncertainties.
                        These include hazard uncertainty, incident uncertainty, sequential
                        uncertainty, informational uncertainty, consequential uncertainty, cascade
                        uncertainty, organizational uncertainty, and background uncertainty. In view
                        of the uncertainties, the primary aim of planners should not be to try to
                        create plans for ever more contingencies, since contingencies are far too
                        numerous and perhapsapproach infinity, but rather to create capabilities
                        (through proper preparedness) for resilience during crisis. Resilience can
                        be cultivated through improvements in information acquisition and
                        dissemination, communication systems, resource management, mobility
                        management, design for resilience, incident command, and staff
                        versatility.
