The Resilience Scale (RS) was developed to evaluate the levels of resilience in the general population. Its reduced version (RS-14) has presented reliable internal consistency and external validity. However, its psychometric properties have not been systematically evaluated. The objective of this study was to present the psychometric properties of the Brazilian RS-14. A total of 1,139 subjects selected by convenience (62.9% women) from 14 to 59 years old (M = 26.1, SD = 11.61) participated in the study. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) and parallel analysis were conducted in order to assess the factor structure of the scale. A 13-item single-factor solution was achieved. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and multigroup CFA (MGCFA) corroborated the goodness of fit and measurement invariance of the obtained exploratory solution. The levels of resilience correlated negatively with depression and positively with meaning in life and self-efficacy.
