In the context of the increasing frequency and severity of disasters and associated power outages, a resilient energy system is needed to ensure smooth humanitarian operations and critical emergency responses such as preparing relief goods. The availability of electricity during the relief preparation is necessary to ensure that food items are packed efficiently and effectively. This study aims to design a resilient energy system for relief preparation. The objectives include assessing energy requirements during relief operations, determining the optimal energy system, and conducting sensitivity analysis to understand the effects concerning energy demand, component prices, and solar radiation. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the hybrid PV-diesel system is robust to varying parameters.
