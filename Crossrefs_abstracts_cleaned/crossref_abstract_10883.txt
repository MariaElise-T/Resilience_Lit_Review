Abstract
The article discusses the possibilities of the resilience of organizations in the context of a learning organization and presents the results of a survey of the leaders of regional public organizations, on the basis of which the factors of the resilience of organizations are ranked according to importance. The study results have revealed that NGOs further away from regional centres tend to focus on routine management aspects, enabling the members of the organization to communicate and collaborate effectively, meanwhile the development of the members, an essential resilience factor, was not considered as highly important.
