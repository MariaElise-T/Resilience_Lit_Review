The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between mother's subjective happiness, mother attachment, and ego resilience on the academic stress of elementary school students, and to verify the mediating effect of mother attachment and ego resilience. For research analysis, the structural equation model(PLS-SEM) was analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and Smart-PLS 3.0. First, it was confirmed that the mother's subjective happiness had a significant positive effect on mother attachment, but had no significant effect on ego resilience. Second, it was confirmed that mother attachment had a positive effect on ego resilience, and it was found that it had a significant negative effect on academic stress. Third, it was confirmed that ego resilience had a negative effect on academic stress. Fourth, mother's subjective happiness had a positive effect on ego resilience and a negative effect on academic stress through mother attachment as a mediating effect. Fifth, mother attachment had a significant negative effect on academic stress as a mediating effect of ego resilience. Mother's subjective happiness had a negative effect on academic stress due to the double mediating effect of mother's attachment and ego resilience.
