The purpose of this study was to provide information regarding the effects of professionalism perception and ego resilience, the dependent variable and mediator respectively, on the technostress of early childhood teachers. The research subjects were 200 early childhood teachers teaching at kindergartens or childcare centers in Seoul or Gyeonggi Province. The data were analyzed through a reliability test, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and structural equation modelling. Research findings were as follows: First, there were significant differences in professionalism perception by type of institution, teaching experience, education background and age of teachers, differences in technostress by type of institution, teaching experience, age of child in care, and age of teachers; and differences in ego resilience by type of institution and age of child in care. Second, there were negative correlations between professionalism perception and technostress, as with technostress and ego resilience, while there is a positive correlation between professionalism perception and ego resilience. Third, ego resilience has a mediating effect on the relationship between professionalism perception and technostress. The findings suggest that the effect of professionalism perception on technostress can be strengthened further by ego resilience.
