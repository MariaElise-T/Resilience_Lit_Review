Objectives  The purposes of this study was to examine the mediation of academic resilience in the relation between critical thinking disposition and problem solving ability among nursing students.
Methods  Data were collected using a structural questionnaire for 189 nursing students in group M, and the final 182 samples were analyzed for reliability verification, t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlation coefficients using the SPSS 25.0 program. The effect was conducted according to the three-step hierarchical regression analysis procedure of Baron and Kenny, and the significance was verified by the Sobel test.
Results  There was also a significant positive correlation between academic resilience (r=.68, p<.001). Critical thinking disposition and academic resilience explained 58.1% of problem-solving ability, and in the relationship between critical thinking disposition and problem-solving ability, It was confirmed that academic resilience had a partial mediating effect (Î²=.403, p<.001) (Sobel test: Z=5.09, p<.001).
Conclusions  Since it was confirmed that critical thinking disposition and academic resilience are important variables that enhance problem-solving ability, it is suggested that educational strategies considering these variables should be established to improve the problem-solving ability of nursing students.
