Abstract
Indonesia is facing magnificent dilemma for providing food and other agricultural product to meet the food requirement of rapidly growing population and preserving land resources, health of soil ecosystem and mitigating and adapting to climate change (CC). About 70% of agricultural soils in Indonesia has been exhausted and over mined and categorized as sick soils. The impacts of CC has already hit Indonesia and caused the rise of temperature about 0.2-0.3 Â°C per decade and sea level (SRL) about 5 mm per year, drought and floods occur more frequently, the change of rainfall intensity and rainfall pattern, the shifting of planting season and lead to the decreasing of crops yield or yield loss significantly. The CC along coastline (95,181 km) increases and cause a severely more consequence on the livelihoods inhabitants (40% of total population) and decreasing of lowland agriculture. The paddy fields in coastal area until 2050 will decrease around 174,461 ha in Java, 8,095 ha in Bali, 78,701 ha in Sulawesi, 25,372 ha in Kalimantan, 3,170 ha in Sumatera and 2,123 ha in Lombok Island. The effort to restore and maintain the health of soil ecosystem, enhance the productivity and to mitigate and adapt to the climate change can be done by adopting climate smart sustainable agricultural (CSSA). The main objectives of CSSA are to increase the productivity and income (economically viable), improve and maintain the health soils ecosystem, build and strengthen the resilience to climate change and mitigate to reduce the GHGs. The integrated of CSSA in a climate smart sustainable farming village (CSSFV) is expected to more effective for building the resilient the soils ecosystem and farmers, mitigating and reduce the GHGS, increasing the productivity and income of the farmer and enhancing the food security in sustainable ways.
