AbstractIntroductionDifferences in brain network connectivity may reflect the capability of the neurological substrate to compensate for brain damage and preserve cognitive function (cognitive reserve). We examined the associations between white matter connectivity, brain damage markers, and cognition in a population sample of middle‐aged individuals.MethodsA total of 4759 participants from The Maastricht Study (mean age = 59.2, SD = 8.7, 50.2% male) underwent cognitive testing and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), from which brain volume, structural connectivity, and vascular damage were quantified. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate whether connectivity modified the association between brain damage and cognition, adjusted for demographic and cardiometabolic risk factors.ResultsMore atrophic and vascular brain damage was associated with worse cognition scores. Increasing connectivity moderated the negative association between damage and cognition (χ2 = 8.64, df = 3, p ≤ 0.001); individuals with high damage but strong connectivity showed normal cognition.DiscussionFindings support the reserve hypothesis by showing that brain connectivity is associated with cognitive resilience.
