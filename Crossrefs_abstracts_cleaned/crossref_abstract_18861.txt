The study of EU policy towards Central Asia is important for understanding the nature of the integration project itself. The programs implemented by the European Union in Central Asia is very important in terms of developing its potential in the international arena, the ability to turn its «normative power» and economic power into political influence. Central Asian countries’ cooperation with the EU in its development has passed through several phases. The current period seeks to consolidate and expand the EU’s position in Central Asia. The EU as a reliable partner has a strong interest in seeing Central Asia as a stable, rules-based and connected area. According to the new 2019 Strategy, the goal of the EU is foster resilience through knowledge-sharing (training, monitoring, mentoring and advising) and financial aid. Resilience is a main message in this strategy. The EU policy is aimed at transforming Central Asian states in accordance with its own vision and interests. The EU connects this ultimate goal with the democratic and economic development of Central Asia and this indicates that normative component of the EU foreign policy is still crucial one. Such approach implemented within the framework of various formats does not always achieve its goal and faces resistance from national elites.
