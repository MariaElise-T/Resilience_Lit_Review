Abstract
Our goal with this review is to explore and describe how conceptualisations of resilience reported in the health domain compare to conceptualisations in other domains (specifically, engineering sciences, socio-ecological sciences, and community resilience concepts). The search string focussed purely on medical/clinical databases as our aim was to compare studies in this domain compared to conceptualisations in non-health domains.
