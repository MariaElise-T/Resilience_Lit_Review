SummaryThe resilience of European farms and farming systems has become prominent on the policy agenda, but the definition of resilience tends to be interpreted narrowly as the ability to withstand shocks and maintain the status quo. We argue that resilience encompasses the capacity of farms, farmers and farming systems to anticipate, cope and respond to shocks and stresses. This capacity is not only influenced by resources held and developed by farmers, but also by resources invested and allocated in farming systems by government and society at large. Furthermore, resilience is not only about coping with crisis, it is also about building up capacity to adapt or even transform farming systems. This should be done by reflecting on three key questions: (1) what characteristics of a farming system enable or constrain anticipating, coping and responsive capacities; (2) which actors can – or even should – play which role in building and mobilising resources to develop these capacities; and (3) how should institutions govern investment in and use resources and capacities? The Common Agricultural Policy – but also other policies – play a key role in determining farming system resilience. However, they tend to put more resources into developing safety nets than into stimulating adaptation and especially transformation.
