 Healthcare decision-makers are becoming increasingly aware that climate change poses significant threats to population health and continued delivery of quality care. Challengingly, responding to climate change requires complex, often expensive, and multi-faceted actions to limit new emissions from worsening climate trajectories, while investing in climate-resilient systems. We present a Climate Resilience Maturity Matrix that brings together both mitigation and adaptation actions into a high-level tool for health leaders, for supporting organizational review, assessment, and decision-making for climate change readiness. This tool is designed to (i) support leaders in Canadian health facilities and regional health authorities in designing mitigation and adaptation roadmaps, (ii) support decision-making for climate change-related strategic planning processes, and (iii) create a high-level overview of organizational readiness. This tool is intended to consolidate key data, provide a clear communication tool, allow for objective rapid baselining, enable system-level gap analysis, facilitate comparability/transparency, and support rapid learning cycles.
