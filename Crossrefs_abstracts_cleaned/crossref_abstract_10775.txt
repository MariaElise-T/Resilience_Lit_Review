PurposeWhile the idea of the resilience of information systems security exists, there is a lack of research that conceptualizes, defines and specifies a way to measure it as a dynamic capability. Drawing on relevant cybersecurity and dynamic capabilities literature, this study aims to define Information Systems Security Resilience (ISSR) as a “dynamic capability of a firm to respond to, and recover from, a security attack” and test it as a new construct.Design/methodology/approachThe authors employ a methodology including multiple phases to develop and test this construct of ISSR. The authors first interview senior managers from various organizations to establish the face validity of the construct; then develop and analyze a pilot survey for internal validity and reliability; and finally, design and deploy a field survey to test and externally validate the construct.FindingsThe authors conceptualize and define the construct of ISSR as a dynamic capability, develop a scale for its measurement and test it in a pilot and field survey. The construct is valid, and the measurement tool works. It demonstrates that resilience is something that is done, rather than had. As a capability, organizations need to track and measure ISSR, which is what this tool provides the ability to do.Originality/valueThis research contributes to the information systems and cybersecurity literature and offers valuable insights for organizations to manage their security effectively.
