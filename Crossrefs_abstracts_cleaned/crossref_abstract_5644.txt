The ability of an infrastructure to be resistant against hazards or to accommodate and recover from hazard-induced destructions and disturbances is characterized as resilience. Usually, infrastructures are engineered socio-technical systems or systems-of-systems. Jackson and Ferris consider the use of finite state machine (FSM) modelling as a suitable means to depict and investigate the resilience of such engineered systems. This paper discusses the capabilities and limitations of the FSM model proposed by Jackson and Ferris and if it should be used for the representation and evaluation of the resilience of an infrastructure. The discussion is conducted on a more general level. However, special attention is paid to monitoring because, on the one hand, monitoring is one of the cornerstones of resilience and, on the other hand, Scott and Ferris define a state that is emphasized by an increased level of situational awareness as a result of happened and perceived events. Consequently, the question has to be answered of how the models are able to reflect the need for routine monitoring of the resilience of infrastructures in order to initiate, if necessary, adjustment procedures as an appropriate response to changes in internal and external conditions. The results of this theoretical study are a fundamental step towards the practical application of the FSM approach for the design of resilient infrastructures.
