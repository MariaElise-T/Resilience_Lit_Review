Medical consultants play significant role in the lives of people. It is unfortunate that in these roles they play for the health and survival of the citizens, they are not usually appreciated and supported by the various governments. Idiosyncratic deals as negotiated by these consultants in most instances become the real way out of the bad situations and circumstances they find themselves. These consultants and their ability to negotiate work agreements become a veritable means of sustaining the work interest and passion. In this circumstance, employee engagement becomes the anchor that defines the level of commitment and interest in the workplace.   Psychological resilience is also another important variable that helps in the realization of this assignment as any organization that does not have the requisite psychological capital may not achieve much.  Thus, proper idiosyncratic deal is very important in ensuring that the health of the people are safe guarded and the necessary manpower is retained and not deterred by the insincerity and ineptitude of the government . One hundred and ten people participated in the research and they were drawn from hospitals in Imo state. The research adopted cross sectional survey design.  Regression analysis was used in analyzing the data. Of note, the results indicate that the variables predicted employee engagement. The implication confirms the relevance of idiosyncratic deals in sustaining the hospitals in Imo State especially in view of the continued lack of medical infrastructure. Psychological resilience programs should be encouraged and intensified so that the wide knowledge and expertise of medical consultants will not be lost in view of the prevailing poor conditions of work of the medical consultants. Efforts should be made by stakeholders and actors in the health sectors in ensuring maximum attention to issues concerning the manpower management, resources and sustenance.
