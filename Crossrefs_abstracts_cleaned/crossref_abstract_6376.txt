Previous research shows that there is a significant and positive relationship between being a victim of violence and experiencing high levels of psychological problems among young people. Conversely, resilience is negatively associated with psychological problems among young people in general, and this negative association is particularly strong among victims of violence. Our study examines resilience among young people (aged ≥ 18 years) who reported being victims of multiple forms of violence during childhood and adolescence using data from two national youth surveys administered in Norway in 2007 (N = 7033) and 2015 (N = 4531), respectively. We first compared the score of resilience, as measured by the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ), and the prevalence of poly-victimization, as identified by the number of young people in our study who were exposed to three of the four forms of violence (i.e., non-physical violence, witnessing violence against parents, physical violence, and sexual abuse). Second, we tested our hypothesis using our data and found that resilience—individuals’ capacity to handle adversity, as well as their use of social and cultural resources when facing adversity—moderates the association between poly-victimization and the onset of psychological problems.
