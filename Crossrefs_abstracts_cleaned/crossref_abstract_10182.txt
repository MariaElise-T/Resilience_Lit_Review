Training and development programs are crucial for enhancing employee performance in organizations, including in Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). However, the effectiveness of these programs depends on several factors. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that influence the effectiveness of training, resilience factor and development towards employee performance. The study employed a quantitative research approach, and data were collected through a survey questionnaire distributed to 132 employees. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.The findings of this study revealed that employee readiness, the effectiveness of speaker, training content, training methods, and training evaluation are significant factors that influence the effectiveness of training and development on employee performance. Employee readiness, including motivation, attitudes, and readiness to learn, significantly affects the effectiveness of training and development programs. Furthermore, training content and methods, such as relevance, applicability, and interactivity, significantly impact employee performance and resilience factor. Finally, training evaluation, including feedback and assessment, significantly contributes to the effectiveness of training and development programs.In conclusion, this study suggests that UTeM should consider these factors when designing and implementing training, resilience factor and development programs to enhance employee performance. By understanding these factors, UTeM can create effective training and development programs that meet the needs of its employees and ultimately improve their performance.
