Chitosan (CS) and its derivatives show antibacterial and antifungal properties and could help treat and prevent denture stomatitis (DS). Mechanical and surface properties of resilient denture liners were evaluated when modified with CS salts. CS-hydrochloride (CS-HCl) and CS-glutamate (CS-G) were added to resilient denture liners Ufi Gel P and Coe-Soft at four different concentrations (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 1% w/w) from which specimens were produced, as well as a control group of each material with no added CS salt. Ten specimens per group (Ø 35 mm, height 6 mm) were manufactured. They were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for a total of 30 days (d). Shore A hardness (SHA) and surface roughness (Ra) were evaluated after 24 h (T1), 7 d (T2), 14 d (T3) and 30 d (T4). Kruskal–Wallis and U-test (Bonferroni-Holm adjusted) were used for statistical analysis (p ≤ 0.05). Ra increased significantly once CS salts were added. SHA increased significantly for some groups, but all specimens fulfilled requirements set by ISO 10139-2:2016. Modification with CS salts does not influence the mechanical properties of the modified resilient denture liners in a clinically relevant manner. Despite the increased roughness, the concept is suitable for further studies. Especially antimicrobial/antibiofilm studies are needed.
