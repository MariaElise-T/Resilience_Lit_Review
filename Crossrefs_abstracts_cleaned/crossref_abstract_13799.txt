The article is devoted to assessing the development prospects of the Russian coal industry in modern conditions using the concept of economic resilience, as well as to optimizing coal mining and processing based on the use of promising technologies in accordance with global challenges and the requirements of the energy transition, which deeply affects all key parameters of both the coal industry and countries and regions with significant reserves of energy resources and specializing in their production. One of the key drivers of the new development paradigm is the active formation of new value chains for high-tech products. The authors point out that despite the currently emerging paradigm of a carbon-free concept of energy development, the coal industry can be saved on the basis of a differentiated approach to upgrading value chains that can already be formed at existing coal mining enterprises.
