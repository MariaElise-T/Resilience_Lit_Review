 Aim: The study examined (a) the relationship between caregivers’ (CG) quality of life (QoL) and their reports about care receivers’ dementia symptoms and (b) whether CG’s resilience would be a mediator in this relationship. Method: This was a cross-sectional study based on a purposeful sampling. Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted with 118 CGs (79% females, mean age = 59, SD = 12). CGs provided assessment of their QoL and resilience, and proxy assessments of people with dementia (PwD) symptoms (cognitive functioning, functional activity and behavioural problems (BP)). Results: The BP were the only perceived dementia symptoms associated with the CGs’ QoL. CGs’ resilience fully mediated the relationship between perceived BP and CGs’ QoL. Implications: Tailored training programs designed to improve CGs’ QoL should focus on strengthening their personal resources, such as skills to manage the behaviour problems exhibited by PwD and their resilience to adapt to self-perceived behaviour problems common to dementia.
