Abstract
The implementation of the Community Forestry (HKm) program in a community group causes changes in community land management and becomes a challenge for sustainable forest management. This study aims to determine the level of ability (resilience) of the community to survive in the face of changes in community forestry policies. The approach used in this research is qualitative and quantitative. The survey method was used by conducting interviews to collect data from groups and other community members as well as key informants. The results showed that the level of community resilience in implementing Social Forestry policies adhered to indicators of natural resources, socio-culture, and economics concluded that there were several aspects that became the reasons for group members to stay in HKm including system functioning parameters (average 65%), income (average 37%), participation (average 88%) and capacity (average 82%).
