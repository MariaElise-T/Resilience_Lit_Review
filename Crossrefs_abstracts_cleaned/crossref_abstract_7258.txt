This article aims to identify the contribution of the Al-Invest program to resilience and economic growth in companies in the chemical sector. The study sample consists of 596 European and Latin American companies that benefited from Al-Invest. It was found that Knowledge Transfer was not the main interest in the collaborations. The economic dynamics of the chemical industry pressure companies to compete, having a low impact on local development when it comes to knowledge transfer. Al-Invests contribution is oriented to the company in four aspects: relational capital with foreign agents, geographic openness, open innovation, and greater technological and marketing capacity. These four elements increase the resilience and economic growth of the company, accompanied by a favorable impact on economic development in the region.
