AbstractIn recent years, achieving resilience has become an important objective in many system development efforts. Resilience is defined as a system's ability to deliver required capability in the face of adversity. Developing resilient systems often depends on first establishing good resilience requirements. Resilience requirements are complex compound requirements and developing high quality resilience requirements is a challenge. In this paper we follow both a deductive and inductive approach to identify the critical content and structure of resilience requirements. We develop a pattern that represents that information and model that pattern in three forms, all containing the same information. The three forms are: 1) natural language, 2) entity‚Äêrelationship diagram, and 3) an extension to SysML. Having multiple forms makes the pattern easily developed, understood, and validated by stakeholders who are not modeling experts, while at the same time being formal, precise and computationally consumable. The resulting resilience requirements are consistent with systems engineering methodologies and are easily utilized in Model Based Systems Engineering and Digital Engineering environments.
