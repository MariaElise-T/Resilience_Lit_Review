 The resiliency of infrastructure, particularly as related to transportation networks, is essential to any society. This resiliency is especially vital in the aftermath of disasters. Recent events around the globe, including Hurricane Katrina and significant seismic events in Haiti, Chile, and Japan, have increased the awareness and the importance of resiliency. Transportation systems are key to response and recovery. These systems must withstand stress, maintain baseline service levels, and be stout enough in physical design and operational concept to provide restoration to the system. Analysis of a transportation network's resiliency before a disruptive event will help decision makers identify specific weaknesses within the network so that investments and improvement projects are prioritized appropriately. Previous research in quantification of network resiliency was expanded into a proposed methodology, through which understanding and applying concepts of network resiliency could preclude many devastating effects of destabilizing events and preserve the quality of life and economic stability.
