This study aimed to expand on previous research elucidating the effects of dispositional resilience and self-efficacy on practice in advanced care planning (ACP) of terminally ill patients among Taiwanese nurses using path modeling. This cross-sectional study was conducted using cluster sampling. Data were collected using demographics, nursesâ€™ knowledge, attitude, and practice of ACP (KAP-ACP) inventory, Dispositional Resilience Scale, and General Self-Efficacy Scale. A total of 266 nurses from a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan participated in this study in 2019. The results showed that gender and ward were significant K-ACP predictors among nurses. The ACP knowledge, ward, and experience of caring for terminally ill friends or relatives were significant A-ACP predictors, whereas ACP attitudes, dispositional resilience, self-efficacy, ward, and the frequency of caring for terminally ill patients were the key predictors of P-ACP. The path modeling showed that dispositional resilience; self-efficacy; medical, surgical, hematology and oncology wards; previous experience in caring for terminally ill friends or relatives; participating in the do-not-resuscitate signature; and the frequency of caring for terminally ill patients directly influenced ACP practices. We recommend that nurses enhance their dispositional resilience and self-efficacy, which may encourage them to appreciate the value of ACP practice of terminally ill patients and improve the quality of care.
