Nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure present an opportunity to reduce air pollutant concentrations and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents new findings from a controlled field study in Ontario, Canada, evaluating the impact of productive applications of green infrastructure on air pollution and carbon dioxide concentrations across different agricultural morphologies compared to other non-productive applications. This study demonstrates that productive green infrastructure applications are as beneficial as non-productive applications in reducing ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Nature-based solutions present an opportunity to build climate resilience into agricultural systems through supply-side mitigation and adaptation. The implementation of productive green infrastructure could be a viable agricultural practice to address multiple climate change impacts.
