There is a global trend towards zero-energy or even positive-energy buildings, including healthcare facilities. Energy efficiency activities have been investigated and applied successfully for more than 20 years in healthcare facilities in general and hospitals in particular. It is in the last decade that on-site energy production mainly from photovoltaics has been considered mainly as an extra revenue stream for healthcare facilities. Back-up systems are still diesel generator-based in most cases and only recently has there been interest in unifying the energy systems of healthcare facilities in order to integrate the operation of the main systems of the hospital with the on-site renewable energy production and the back-up systems. Hospitals play a very crucial role in our societies. There is a need to achieve the best results in terms of healthcare services but, at the same time, to reduce the cost of these services without affecting the quality level, to enhance resilience and to increase environmental sustainability. As far as energy is concerned, this is feasible and can be accomplished using energy efficiency interventions and on-site power generation and storage using renewable energy technologies. An Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) has to be in place in order to harvest the benefits of all the related subsystems allowing them to operate effectively and harmoniously, while at the same time ensuring the operation of the hospital under extreme conditions, e.g., after a natural disaster. The research concerning IEMSs for hospitals is at its first steps and needs to gain momentum.
