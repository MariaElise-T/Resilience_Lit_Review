 This cross-sectional study examined the effect of trait resilience and specific types of rumination on positive psychological adaptation post-diagnosis among 201 breast cancer patients. They completed self-reported measures describing trait resilience, rumination, posttraumatic growth, and health-related quality of life. Hierarchical analysis showed that trait resilience significantly predicted higher quality of life and posttraumatic growth after controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Additionally, “intrusion” and “brooding” subtypes of rumination negatively predicted quality of life, with “instrumentality” positively predicting quality of life and posttraumatic growth, suggesting the importance of trait resilience and multidimensional rumination for positive psychological changes among breast cancer survivors.
