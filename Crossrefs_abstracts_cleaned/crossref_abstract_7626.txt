 This commentary adds to Simon and Randalls’ interrogation of resilience by offering three insights into a more vibrant understanding of multiplicity. First, this article seeks to align the current development of an ever-expanding scientific (and political) project called ‘resilience thinking’, with the ambivalence of resilience politics. Second, it responds to resilience multiple by proposing that resilience is also fluid, a term derived from de Laet and Mol’s fluid technology. Lastly, it extends the implication of fluidity within resilience thinking to the agency of a quasi-actant that shapes and disrupts the current political project of the uncertain future.
