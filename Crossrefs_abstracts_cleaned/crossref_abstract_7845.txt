Abstract
As an emerging safety perspective, resilience engineering is attracting increasingly attentions in aerospace industry. Numerous researches have been carried out to explore ATM resilience properties from different aspects. Nevertheless, there appear to be significant variations on the research objects, issues concerned, methods employed and indexes used. As far as we know, there seems to be an absence of a dedicated literature review to explore the application status of resilience in ATM area. To this end, our work is concentrated on the research situation and progress of resilience in ATM. A wide range of databases are retrieved to obtain an extensive coverage of the literature. Subsequently, the research works are reviewed on the basis of different classifications followed by a brief introduction of related findings and implications. Attempting to provide some reference for further studies, promising directions are pointed out in view of the challenges and requirements. It is desired that this work may throw some light on further explorations of ATM resilience.
