AbstractIn this study, high resilience polyester fibers and low melting point polyester (LMPET) fibers are blended at varying ratios in order to form buffering composite nonwoven fabrics. Next, the employment of hot pressing enables the combination of the fabrics and elastic polymer films. The mechanical and buffering properties of the composites are evaluated in terms of the blending ratio and the thickness of the composites. As per the interface observation and the results of the peel test, the nonwoven fabrics and polymer films are firmly bonded. The tensile test results indicate that when there is more content of LMPET fibers, the reinforcement to the composites is greater. Conversely, the puncture test results indicate that the LMPET‐fiber‐free composites possess 1.4 times higher puncture resistance. Based on the results of the hammer rebound and compression recovery tests, a greater thickness provides the composites with better buffering efficacy.
