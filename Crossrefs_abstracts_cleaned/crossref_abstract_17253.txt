 The Five Part Model or Five Areas Model has been a pivotal component of cognitive behavioural therapy and the treatment of various psychological disorders. The Five Part Model consists of five components that represent the interaction of an individual's environment, thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and physical reactions. To date the Five Part Model has primarily been used to understand what has already happened to an individual; for example, when an individual is suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder or is being treated for other psychological difficulties. However, there has been limited application of the Five Part Model to the concept of resilience. Given the effectiveness of the model as an assessment and treatment tool, then it is possible that this model would also be effective in understanding how an individual deals with the aftermath of traumatic events such as disasters. Individual psychological variables are an essential part of whether an individual is resilient to adverse circumstances. However, this model should include as part of the individual's environment wider family, community and societal attributes. It is suggested that the Five Part Model be expanded to include such family, community and societal attributes to account for the influence these have on an individual's psychological resilience. A multidimensional model of resilience is proposed that will need to be scientifically tested; however, it is proposed that this model has application to the variety of disciplines that are involved in the domain of resilience. In addition, this model attempts to address any interdisciplinary barriers that exist, by ensuring that individual, family, community, and societal attributes are considered holistically as part of resilience building.
