Intermodal freight transportation networks (seaport-road-rail) constitute the economic backbone of coastal communities. From the current state of the literature, it is observed that despite their importance, intermodal transportation networks remain unserved with comprehensive tools that support high-level planning for resilience of existing and future infrastructure under hurricane scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper proposes the implementation of a decision support tool based on digital twinning, which is able to predict system performance in terms of resilience, given three main inputs: hazard intensities, budgetary constraints, and the characteristics and topology of the network.
