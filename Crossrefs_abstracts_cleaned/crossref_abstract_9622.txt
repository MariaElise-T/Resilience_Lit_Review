AbstractIntellectual diversity, which is often assessed through social diversity proxies, such as race, ethnicity, and gender, is essential to innovation in ecology. There are many diverse ways of knowing, valuing, and discerning alternatives within ecology and as it is applied to solve global‐change issues. However, science is a cultural activity, one that is affected by colonialism, racism, and White supremacy and, like other fields of science, the pursuit of ecological careers has historically been a space of limited opportunities for participation for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)—narrowing the diverse ways of knowing, valuing, and engaging in ecological work. We seek to debunk the view that such limited participation is a result of BIPOC lacking interest in or proficiency in science, and instead offer that BIPOC communities are places of deep scientific understanding, sociocultural resilience, and cultural wealth. Scientists must broaden their consideration of the ecological sciences and work with BIPOC to establish community‐based scientific partnerships that will foster increased ecological career pathways for BIPOC youth.
