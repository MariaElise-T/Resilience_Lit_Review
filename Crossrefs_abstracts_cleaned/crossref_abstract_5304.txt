In order to evaluate the influence of viscoelastic properties of resilient denture liners on the pressures under dentures, a series of creep and stress relaxation tests were carried out using a simplified mandibular edentulous model and denture model. Two diaphragm pressure sensors were attached to the edentulous model so that they contacted the residual ridge and the buccal slope. The results may be summarized as follows: (i) The use of resilient denture liners is effective for stress relief under dentures. (ii) The thickness increase of each denture liners causes the effect of stress relaxation. (iii) The material exhibited viscoelastic behaviour after applying the stress and has the ability to distribute stress or stress relaxation. It is important to understand the viscoelastic behaviours of each resilient denture liner and choose the material according to the clinical situation. The information obtained should be useful to clinicians when they select materials for their patients.
