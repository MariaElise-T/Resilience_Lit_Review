AbstractBackgroundA scarcity of studies on the role of resilience resources (RRs) and vulnerability risk (VR) in children and adolescents with primary headache hampers the development of a risk‐resilience model for pediatric headaches.ObjectiveTo examine the extent to which headache frequency and diagnosis are associated with RRs and VR and explore possible predictors of low RRs and high VR in a cross‐sectional population‐based study in adolescents.MethodsThis is a cross‐sectional population study conducted in a small city in Brazil (Delfinópolis). Consents and analyzable data were obtained from 339/378 adolescents (89.7%). RRs and VR were assessed using the validated Brazilian version of the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents, completed by the adolescents. Parents filled a structured questionnaire assessing sociodemographic and headache characteristics, as well as the Brazilian‐validated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire added to the impact supplement to evaluate the adolescent's psychosocial adjustment skills. Teachers completed a structured questionnaire about the students’ school performance.ResultsA higher frequency of headache was associated with lower RRs (F3,335 = 2.99, p = 0.031) and higher VR (F3,335 = 4.05, p = 0.007). Headache diagnosis did not significantly influence the risk of having lower RRs or higher VR. In the exploratory analyses, females (OR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.16–9.3) and individuals with psychosocial adjustment problems (OR 7.5; 95% CI: 2.51–22.4) were predictors of low RRs, and prenatal exposure to tobacco (OR 5.6; 95% CI: 1.57–20.9) was a predictor of high VR in adolescents with primary headache.ConclusionsThe risk of low RRs and high VR was associated with a higher headache frequency, but not with headache diagnosis. These findings may contribute to the development of a risk‐resilience model of headaches in the pediatric population and help identify novel targets and develop effective resources for successful interventions.
