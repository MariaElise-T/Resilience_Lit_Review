The concept of resilience originated in engineering and environmental systems
   theories. Resilience entered humanities relatively recently as a new
   theoretical and practical approach to addressing challenges and risks in
   both macro and micro-communities. The concept of resilience is being
   criticized for theoretical fluidity behind it, difficulties related to its
   empirical verification and for being ideologically embedded in the
   neoliberal framework of global capitalism. Subject of this paper is an
   overview of a sharper critique of the concept that is coming from feminist
   perspective. In perspective of feminist criticism, the concept of resilience
   is perceived as an element of hegemony in neoliberal theory that purports
   deregulation and in particular market deregulation. While at first glance
   the concept of resistance denies identity policies and social exclusion
   deriving from it, in fact it absorbs harm inflicted by neoliberal economic
   and social restructuring. Resilience allows induced damage to be recycled
   given that new identity frames and aesthetics become created. Gender status
   is no longer associated with visible gender manifestation - it rather
   appears as it is shaped by economic and social background. Resilience
   becomes new neoliberal female ideal feature that only enhances vitality of
   white supremacist patriarchy.
