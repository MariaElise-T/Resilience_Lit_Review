Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) is a well-established resilience coaching program for youth with chronic illness. It is a one-on-one intervention targeting skills in stress management, goal-setting, cognitive reframing, and meaning-making. We aimed to (i) assess the feasibility and acceptability of PRISM and (ii) explore PRISM’s impact on clinical outcomes among youth with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). This was a single-arm pilot trial of PRISM for youth with CMP aged 12–17 years. Patients completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) pre- and post- intervention; patients and caregivers provided qualitative feedback. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (63% enrollment rate); 82% percent were female. The patients’ median age was 16 years (IQR: 13–16). The intervention completion rate was 81% (n = 22). The mean satisfaction for PRISM overall was 4.3 (SD 0.9), while the mean acceptability of the intervention measure (AIM) was 4.4 (SD 0.89). Participants reported improved resilience (2.2 [SD 5.1]), functional disability (−3.5 [IQR: −6.0, 1.0]), and psychological distress (−1.0 [−5.0, 2.0]) from baseline to immediately post-treatment; pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and global health were similar at both time points. Feedback was positive and suggested that a group component may be helpful. PRISM is feasible and acceptable among youth with CMP. Exploratory analyses suggest improvements in clinically relevant outcomes, warranting further investigation.
