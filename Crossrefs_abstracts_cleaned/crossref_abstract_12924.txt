ABSTRACT  Objective: to understand how the meanings attributed to work by professionals of the Family Health Strategy are linked to the mechanisms of risk and protection, influencing resilience.  Method: a qualitative case study, conducted with professionals of the Family Health Strategy. 62 professionals participated: 14 doctors, 16 nurses, 16 nursing technicians and 16 community health agents. The data collected through interviews which were guided by semi-structured script and observation were submitted to thematic content analysis and Atlas.ti Software, version 7.  Results: adversities in the work environment emerged from the analysis such as work overload, lack of articulation between health network services, insufficient autonomy and recognition and inadequate working conditions. Such experiences imply risks to the meanings and the development of work, limiting more resolute actions in the care of the population. Mechanisms that provide protection against risks were also highlighted, strengthening the positive meanings given to work that favor resilience.  Conclusion: the study made it possible to understand how the meanings attributed to work are linked to risk and protection mechanisms, influencing resilience processes. Such reflections can support strategies to reduce adversity in the work environment, stimulate the professionals' potentialities and positive senses about work, aiming at reaching a healthy work environment, which affect the care actions to the population.
