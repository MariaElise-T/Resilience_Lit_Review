PurposeThis study investigates the impact of supply chain governance (SCG, which includes relational governance and contractual governance) on supply chain resilience (SCR) using the information processing theory. Moreover, the study also examines the mediating role of information processing capability and the moderating role of digital technology (DT) deployment.Design/methodology/approachA total of 288 questionnaires were collected from the Chinese manufacturing industry, and hierarchical regression was used to empirically test the proposed model.FindingsThis study reveals that SCG positively impacts SCR. Moreover, information processing capability plays a mediating role between SCG and SCR. Furthermore, the breadth of DT deployment positively moderates the effect of relational governance on information processing capability, and the depth of DT deployment positively moderates the effects of both relational governance and contractual governance on information processing capability.Originality/valueThis study offers a novel perspective that helps to understand the importance of the supply chain-wide information acquired by SCG in respect of improving SCR. Furthermore, this article extends the application of information processing theory by providing empirical evidence of the mediating role of information processing capability and elucidating the moderating role of DT deployment.
