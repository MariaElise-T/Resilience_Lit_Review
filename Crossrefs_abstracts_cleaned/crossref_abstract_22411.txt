SummaryThis paper considers resilient event‐triggered control problem for a class of networked systems subject to randomly occurring deception attacks. First, a new memory event‐triggered scheme (METS) is proposed to reduce the utilization of communication resources while maintaining desired system performance. Different from some existing event‐triggered schemes, some recently released packets are firstly utilized in the proposed METS, which provides a better flexibility to improve the system dynamics. Second, considering the security problem of the networked control systems, a randomly occurring deception attack model is employed where the bounded malicious signals are injected by the adversary. Considering both the effects of METS and deception attack, new type of networked control system model is constructed and the corresponding memory state‐feedback controller is designed. Then, sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability of the systems are derived by using a Lyapunov functional technique. Finally, the obtained results are verified through a pendulum system, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
