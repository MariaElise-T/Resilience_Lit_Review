The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted an unprecedented impact on the mental health of nursing students globally, particularly due to the abrupt transition to online education. This study aims to: 1) delineate the demographic and academic profile of Saudi nursing students; 2) evaluate their academic resilience; and 3) identify predictors of academic resilience. Employing a cross-sectional approach, the research highlights the significant influence of gender and grade point average (GPA) on students' academic resilience and psychological well-being. Distinct challenges in academic motivation are evident among both male and female students, while a higher GPA correlates with increased optimism and resilience. This study underscores the enduring resilience and perseverance of nursing students in navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic, both prior to and subsequent to its onset.
