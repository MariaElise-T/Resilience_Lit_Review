Purpose – Supply chain disruptions have dominated business planning and performance since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to mar organizations through 2022. This research carefully examines the role of organizational culture in developing both supply chain resilience and market performance amid supply chain disruptions.
Design/Methodology/Approach – An empirical study of over 200 South Korean firms were tested. The model is tested using PLS-SEM; furthermore, mediation effects enrich the quality of the findings. This research is framed utilizing the stimulus-organism-response model; thus, emphasizing the highly dynamic business environment that has ensued.
Findings – The research confirms that supply chain disruption orientation, a strategic orientation and a proxy for a well-prepared organizational culture, leads to both supply chain resilience and market performance. Results also confirm that resilience reinforces market performance throughout the supply chain. Study contributions suggest that firms should consider themselves as organisms within a highly dynamic environment and develop a highly prepared organizational culture in order to bolster supply chain resilience and market performance.
Research Implications – Scholars can further employ the stimulus-organism-response model in firm-level research and further study the link between organizational culture and supply chain performance amid COVID-19. Finally, the results of this research provide guidelines for organizations when they decide on operational procedures during the pandemic, as they aim to produce greater returns for their ventures.
