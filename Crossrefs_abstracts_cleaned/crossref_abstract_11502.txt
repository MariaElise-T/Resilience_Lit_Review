AbstractClimate change poses tremendous pressure on agriculture. Camelina sativa is an ancient, low‐input, high‐quality oilseed crop for food, feed and industrial applications that has retained its natural stress tolerance. Its climate resilience, adaptability to different growth conditions, and the qualities of its seed oil and cake have spurred the interest in camelina. However, due to a period of neglect it has not yet undergone intensive breeding and knowledge about this multi‐purpose crop is still limited. Metabolism is strongly associated with plant growth and development and little information is available on camelina primary carbohydrate metabolism. Here, eight camelina lines from different geographic and climatic regions were characterized for important growth parameters and agricultural traits. Furthermore, the activities of key enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism were analysed in leaves, seedpods, capsules, and developing seeds. The lines differed in shoot and leaf morphology, plant height, biomass formation as well as in seed yield and seed oil and protein content. Key carbohydrate metabolism enzymes showed specific activity signatures in leaves and reproductive organs during seed development, and different lines exhibited distinct enzyme activity patterns, providing a valuable basis for developing new physiological markers for camelina breeding programs.
