Abstract
Health facilities and healthcare providers are responsible for the prevention, treatment and control of diseases and must have an increased capacity for resilience to deal with a crisis regardless of its nature. All medical facilities and healthcare providers in Romania have faced challenges in managing cases of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mission of this study was to highlight the main challenges generated by the development of the resilience of health facilities and medical service providers in Romania during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide concrete solutions to respond correctly to this crisis. This qualitative study was conducted through structured interviews with 45 people occupying management positions within public medical units and private healthcare providers. Study participants were selected using a non-probability sampling technique and thematic review was used to analyze the data.
