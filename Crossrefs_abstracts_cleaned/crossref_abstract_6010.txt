Background: Resilience is one of the factors that can prevent psychological problems among young people and adolescents. The purpose of the present study was to design and explain a psychological resilience model based on the feeling of social support through hardiness among high school students in Sari, Iran.
Materials and Methods: The present descriptive-correlational study was carried out on a total of 280 first-grade students in the high schools of Sari selected using multistage cluster sampling. Resilience questionnaire, social support questionnaire, and problem-solving questionnaire were employed for data collection. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling were utilized to analyze the data using SPSS.22 and AMOS.22.
Results: The mean age values of the male and female students were reported as 13.4±2.4 and 13.8±2.5 years, respectively. The obtained results of the current study showed that there was a positive relationship between social support with resilience and hardiness. Hardiness also mediated the relationship between social support and resilience. Among the components of social support, the most influential factor was related to family support, and the most effective factor in resilience was the notion of competence and acceptance of love. In addition, the most effective factor in hardiness was the component of commitment.
Conclusion: The results of the present study revealed that hardiness and resilience increased with the enhancement of social support. The impact of social support on resilience also increased partially as a result of increased hardiness.
