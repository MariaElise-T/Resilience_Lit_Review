Abstract
For decades, reliability has been the watchword for electric utilities, but now thereâ€™s a focus on a related concept: Resilience. It has gained notice as planners began thinking about increased natural disasters brought on by climate change, man-made interference due to malicious cyberattacks, and the instability brought about by adding large quantities of renewable energy. Resilience has become a legitimate field of study involving industry, academia, and government labs, complete with experts in the field. This article delves deeper into the need to achieve electrical grid resiliency as intensity of natural disaster amplifies.
