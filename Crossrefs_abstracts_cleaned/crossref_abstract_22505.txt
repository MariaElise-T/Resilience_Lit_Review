AbstractBackgroundDisease resilience, which is the ability of an animal to maintain performance under disease, is important for pigs in commercial herds, where they are exposed to various pathogens. Our objective was to investigate population-level gene expression profiles in the blood of 912 healthy F1 barrows at ~ 27 days of age for associations with performance and health before and after their exposure to a natural polymicrobial disease challenge at ~ 43 days of age.ResultsMost significant (q < 0.20) associations of the level of expression of individual genes in blood of young healthy pigs were identified for concurrent growth rate and subjective health scores prior to the challenge, and for mortality, a combined mortality-treatment trait, and feed conversion rate after the challenge. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed three groups of gene ontology biological process terms that were related to disease resilience: 1) immune and stress response-related terms were enriched among genes whose increased expression was unfavorably associated with both pre- and post-challenge traits, 2) heme-related terms were enriched among genes that had favorable associations with both pre- and post-challenge traits, and 3) terms related to protein localization and viral gene expression were enriched among genes that were associated with reduced performance and health traits after but not before the challenge.ConclusionsGene expression profiles in blood from young healthy piglets provide insight into their performance when exposed to disease and other stressors. The expression of genes involved in stress response, heme metabolism, and baseline expression of host genes related to virus propagation were found to be associated with host response to disease.
