Hubs are critical facilities in the power projection network. Due to the uncertainty factors such as terrorism threats, severe weather, and natural disasters, hub facilities may be disrupted randomly, which could lead to excessive cost or loss in practice. One of the most effective ways to withstand and reduce the impact of disruptions is designing more resilient networks. In this paper, a stochastic programming model is employed for the hub location problem in the presence of random hub failures. A heuristic algorithm based on Monte Carlo method and tabu search is put forward to solve the model. The proposed approach is more general if there are numbers of hubs that would fail even with different failure probability. Compared with the benchmark model, the model which takes the factor of stochastic failure of hubs into account can give a more resilient power projection network.
