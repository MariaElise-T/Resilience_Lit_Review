Abstract
This article describes a performance enhancement/resilience training program developed and implemented for both pre- and postdeployment ROTC cadets at California State University, Fullerton. The program integrates a psychophysiological stress profile, multimodal biofeedback training, and a skills-based group educational program to modulate stress reactivity and promote autonomic nervous system flexibility. Heart rate variability biofeedback training receives special emphasis. The impetus for the program and practical guidelines for using biofeedback with military personnel are presented.
