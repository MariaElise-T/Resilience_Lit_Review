 This study aims to examine the association between intergenerational support and self-rated health (SRH) levels using data collected from Chinese older adults residing in Honolulu, United States ( N = 329). We also investigated the mediating role of resilience and the moderating role of gender in the association. We found that receiving emotional support was significantly and positively associated with better SRH for the whole sample. The positive effect of receiving emotional support on health was significant among older women only. In contrast, the beneficial effect of providing economic support on health was significant among older men only. We found that resilience significantly mediated the positive effect of received emotional support on SRH, and this effect was found for the whole sample and among older women. However, resilience did not mediate the positive effect of the economic support provided on SRH among older men.
