BACKGROUND: Children of alcoholics (COAs) have been described as both vulnerable and resilient. Although identified as at-risk for mental and physical health problems, chemical dependency, and child abuse and neglect, many go on to lead successful lives.OBJECTIVE: The relationship between COA status and various adolescent risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse and sexual precocity, was assessed by addressing the following research question: Could parental alcoholism be a risk factor for teens engaging in problem behaviors?STUDY DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a Wyoming high-risk youth data set was conducted (N = 1632). Wernerâ€™s (1992) core resiliency factors provided the conceptual frame for the study.RESULTS: Adolescent COAs scored significantly (p < .000) lower on all psychosocial factors of family/personal strengths and school bonding and significantly higher on all factors of at-risk temperament, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors than non-COAs.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent COAs are at risk for depression, suicide, eating disorders, chemical dependency, and teen pregnancy. It has been proposed that mental health professionals teach core resiliency factors to promote healthy behaviors for this vulnerable population.
