Academic resilience is the studentâ€™s capability to deal efficiently with academic setbacks, anxiety and study pressure. In the present scenario, students are facing a lot of problems in schools as well as in society. If adequate steps are not taken to help overcome these problems, it will create pressure and stress among students. This may lead to poor academic performance and an increased dropout rate. According to Masten (2001), resilient people have the ability to tackle, overcome, or recover from grave academic threats. So, schools, colleges and universities play a major role in developing academic resilience among students. The aim of this paper is to gather and present the review of literature on academic resilience among students at national and international level. This study gives an overview of the importance of creating Academic Resilience among students and how far it supports increasing their academic achievement. In the present study 30 literatures were collected from various online and printed resources.
