Resilience, as a property of a system, must transition from just a buzzword to an operational paradigm for system management, especially under future climate change. Identifying the need for system resilience requires defining the system. Revolutionary advances in hardware, networking, information and human interface technologies require new ways of thinking about how sociotechnical, cyber-physical, and systems of systems are conceptualized, built and evaluated. The aim of this paper is to start a development process for a design theory (DT) for resilient systems (DT4RS). With the help of DT4RS, communities are able to develop and operate different information and security technologies, and share knowledge and best practices.
