Many U.S. coastal cities face the challenge of increasing flood frequency and magnitude due to a combination of increasing sea levels, changing rainfall, and aging infrastructure. Recurrent flooding, sometimes referred to as â€œnuisance floodingâ€, can be symptomatic of such issues. Responding to such impacts can either be tacked in a piece-meal, reactive fashion, or proactively. A number of cities, such as New York (SIRR, 2013) and Boston (City of Boston, 2016) have undertaken or are in the process of planning efforts to recognize such issues and develop strategies to reduce impacts. The flood resilient planning process can take many forms, we shall provide a case-study example overview of a bottom-up, risk-informed effort by the City of Virginia Beach, VA.
