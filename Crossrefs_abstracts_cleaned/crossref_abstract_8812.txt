The wave of globalization introduces the urban economy into a nonlinear network structure system, which makes the urban economic system change unpredictably. How to maintain the healthy and stable development of urban economic system and reduce the risk caused by unpredictable changes has aroused the attention of academia and industry. Accordingly, toughness, as a new research paradigm with overall dynamics and nonlinearity as its core, has been widely explored and analyzed by scholars. Based on the data of various indicators of prefecture-level cities in urban agglomerations in Central Yunnan from 2005 to 2020, this paper evaluates the scores of economic resilience of urban agglomerations in Central Yunnan over the years through entropy weight method. It is found that the economic resilience of urban agglomerations in Central Yunnan has shown an overall fluctuating trend in the past 16 years. Specifically, the economic resilience value declined in 2006, 2010 and 2017, and the economic resilience improved most significantly in 2009 and 2019. Finally, the paper gives some suggestions on how to improve the economic resilience of central Yunnan city cluster in the future.
