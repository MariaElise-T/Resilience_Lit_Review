 This article identifies and discusses some of the challenges to the meaningful incorporation of resilience in commercial engineering projects. In particular it discusses: the tendency for projects to have many disparate consultants with no collective motivation for a coordinated approach to resilience; the current perceived lack of value for the client by addressing resilience; and the absence of either incentive or legislation to provide motivation to address resilience. The article then proposes what is needed to overcome these challenges: a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to managing the whole spectrum of a client's risk. By combining expertise and consolidating mitigation strategies, it is possible to meet the client's needs while maintaining value. It is up to multidisciplinary companies with these capabilities to begin promoting the value of resilient design.
