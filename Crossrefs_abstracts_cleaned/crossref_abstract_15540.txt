 Despite facing more adversity and being at a greater risk of poor long-term outcomes, many neurodivergent individuals thrive and have a “good life” according to subjective and objective standards. Research and clinical practice have most often focused on risk and negative outcomes in neurodivergent individuals. In comparison, very little attention has been paid to resilience and positive outcomes, and individualized assessment of risk and resilience is required for this population. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides a framework to examine positive functional outcomes and the factors important for risk and resilience in developmental diversity. This protocol describes the multi-phase process that will be undertaken to develop ICF Core Sets or sets of ICF codes most relevant to risk and resilience in developmental diversity. Core Sets for risk and resilience in developmental diversity will advance the understanding of outcomes in neurodivergent populations and will provide a basis for developing individualized tools to assess resilience and risk in this population.
