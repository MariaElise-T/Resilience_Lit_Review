This paper constructs an evaluation indicator system for urban resilience in China on four dimensionsâ€”economy, environment, society, and infrastructure. The evaluation indicator is used by the entropy weight method to measure the resilience levels of 138 cities in 8 urban agglomerations from 2005 to 2018. Using the Theil index and variance decomposition method, we explore the size and sources of urban resilience differences among the eight urban agglomerations from the dual perspectives of space and structure and employ geographic detectors to identify the driving factors behind their differences. The results show that although the overall resilience level of the eight urban agglomerations is not high, it shows an upward trend. The differences within the eight urban agglomerations are the main spatial sources of urban resilience differences and economic resilience is the main structural source of urban resilience differences. Moreover, economic resilience and social resilience have the greatest contribution and driving effect on the resilience differences of BTH, YRD, PRD, MYR, CC, GP, and HC urban agglomerations, but the difference in resilience of CP is mainly caused by the difference in infrastructure resilience. Compared with the single factor, the impact of the interaction of each factor is even greater.
