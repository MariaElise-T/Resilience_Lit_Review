Abstract

Objective
Upwards of 14% of late adolescents and young adults (AYAs) experience chronic pain; however, limited research has focused on factors specifically influencing late AYAs as they transition to adulthood. In this topical review, we propose a conceptual model of multidomain pain resilience (MDPR) in late AYAs with chronic pain that extends existing pain resilience literature, including the Ecological Resilience-Risk Model for Pediatric Chronic Pain.


Method
A conceptual framework for MDPR in late AYAs was developed from the existing literature on resilience in young people with chronic pain. Gaps in knowledge specific to late AYAs are identified, and relevant research examining MDPR in adults with pain are summarized to inform applications of this concept to youth as they transition to adulthood.


Results
Few studies have explored resilience factors in pediatric pain. Of note, these endeavors have largely neglected late adolescence and young adulthood, despite unique considerations germane to this crucial developmental period. Existing research has also focused exclusively on assessing resilience as a unitary, rather than a multidimensional construct. Although limited, MDPR has been examined in midlife and older adults with chronic pain, highlighting the need to expand prior models of pain resilience and extend these principles to emerging adulthood.


Conclusions
Understanding MDPR in late AYAs with chronic pain may provide insights regarding measurable and modifiable resilience factors (e.g., adaptive and personal resources) that promote healthy pain-related outcomes (e.g., reduced pain and enhanced physical functioning) and optimize prevention and/or treatment strategies for this group.
