 The effects of different percentages of one traditional additive—hydrated lime—and two by-products—Class C fly ash (CFA) and cement kiln dust (CKD)—on the resilient modulus (Mr) of four different clay subgrades were investigated. It was found that at lower application rates (3% to 6%), the lime-stabilized soil specimens showed highest enhancement in the Mr values. At higher application rates (10% to 15%), however, CKD treatment provided maximum improvements. Three log-log and one semi-log stress-based models were evaluated. Validation of selected models was conducted by using additional soil data. Overall, a semi-log deviatoric and confining stress model was found to show the best acceptable performance. Additional analyses were performed to develop correlations of Mr with compacted specimen characteristics and soil and additive properties. To illustrate the application of the semi-log model, the AASHTO flexible pavement design methodology was used to design asphalt concrete pavement sections.
