Every single organism supports the other either with a symbiotic relationship or in terms of form and/or function. In nature, everything is functional considering each other. For instance, such as some trees shed their leaves to the ground to prepare themselves for strong winter conditions and to create nutrition for microorganisms and fungus under the surface. This kind of interaction with nature could lead architects to develop better solutions to create better built environments; this is the main objective of this paper. Paper aims to clarify and prove that nature is the greatest mentor and can teach humanity many solutions about designing resilient cities. There is a new and powerful way of seeking solutions in nature; biomimicry. In this context, using biomimicry as a design strategy is the main methodology of this study. Biomimicry is used as a design approach to reach examples in nature by filtering them with biology. These examples are considered to be scientific fields for researching and understanding the structural strength, bioclimatic properties, functional morphology and other important features of forests which is explained to identify forests and state resilient solutions for developing resilient cities. Outcomes of this paper aim to scientifically state that forests are naturally sustainable environments, which are the greatest examples for resilient cities, and when they unite, they can create the most suitable living environments for all living organisms. Several conceptual ideas and methods are suggested based on biomimetic design approach to make the argument clear and more understandable.
