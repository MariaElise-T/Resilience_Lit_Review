Abstract
The flash floods, landslides and mudflow in Cameron Highlands are catastrophes which threaten local life and economic activities which depend on tourism activities. Several series of flash floods, landslides and mudflows which occurred in 2014, 2016 and 2018 in Cameron Highlands illustrate that they are the biggest threat to the highland tourism spot in the coming future. This tourist spot may face the risk of being unvisited for a while because of the untreated conditions after the flash floods, landslides and mudflows. This article aims to describe a brief historical summary of flash floods, landslides and mudflows in Cameron Highlands and how this disaster can threaten the readiness of activities in other highland tourism sites. The discussion focuses on the process of building resilience to flash floods in the Cameron Highlands over the last few years. This article ends with a discussion on the challenges to be undertaken in the process of enhancing Cameron Highlands as a highland tourism destination. The discussion suggests that the approach towards achieving sustainable tourism development goals especially in Cameron Highlands should return to the original goal of tourism development with its aim to minimize the environmental impact and protect the human habitat.
