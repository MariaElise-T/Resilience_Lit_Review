This article analyzes resilience and well-being at work as important constructs in the discussion of health promotion. In the hypothesis that well-being correlates with resilience, they are analyzed in the context of positive psychology by dialoguing with social psychology. An exploratory method was used in a sample of 131 nursing technicians. The theoretical models used were the Inventory of Well-being at Work and the Resilience Scale for Adults. Results: Consistency was analyzed by composite reliability and Cronbach's alpha, convergent validity through the AVE. The KMO test verified if the factorial analysis model used was adequately adjusted to the data. Confirmatory factorial analysis was performed for validation and Spearmanâ€™s correlation to measure the relationships between variables. The correlation analysis indicated that there is a positive correlation between indices (r = 0.20, p = 0.096) and indicators of well-being and resilience. Concluding the greater the resilience is, the greater welfare at work is and vice versa.
