 Urban infrastructure is the lifeline and material foundation for the normal operation of cities. It is of great significance to accurately evaluate the resilience level of urban infrastructure and identify the main obstacle factors for the construction of resilient cities. This paper establishes an index system for urban infrastructure resilience evaluation from three dimensions: Pre-disaster prevention capacity, disaster resistance capacity, and post-disaster recovery capacity. It also uses the CRITIC method to determine the index weights and identifies the main obstacle factors based on the obstacle degree model (ODM). The results show that urban infrastructure resilience in China is generally low and varies greatly in terms of structure across provinces and municipalities. The main obstacle factors affecting urban infrastructure resilience include the capacities to conduct pre-disaster prevention and post-disaster recovery in the production and supply of electricity, gas and water, to construct infrastructure recovery projects, and to ensure energy supply and power supply. It is recommended to promote the application of the concept of “resilience” throughout the entire process of urban planning, construction and governance, understand the current situation of urban infrastructure, coordinate the investment of resources such as funding, manpower and technology, enhance the robustness and redundancy of urban infrastructure systems, actively optimize the layout of urban infrastructure, and continuously improve the application of intelligent technologies in infrastructure systems.
