The issue of climate change impact on agriculture and its mitigation through developing resiliency is of prime importance to enhance farmers' income and livelihood security. A study was conducted in Odisha to find out contrast in resilience of agriculture to climate change in coastal and non-coastal district. Agricultural scenario was studied through a composite agricultural scenario index (ASI) during 2001 to 2014.The coastal district Balasore showed a relatively better resilience in the years of climatic disasters maintaining the ASI value at a higher level as compared to non-coastal district Khurda due to better agricultural and irrigation water resources scenario in Balasore district. However, Balasore is more vulnerable than Khurda in all the seasons; vulnerability of Balasore and Khurda districts is found highest in monsoon and pre-monsoon period, respectively. About 90 percent of sampled farm households possess irrigated land in Balasore district and rainfed land in Khurda district. A remarkable dent in crop productivity is seen during calamity years, which are more severe in Khurda district during heat waves and cyclone than Balasore district, which faces a decline during cyclone and flood.
