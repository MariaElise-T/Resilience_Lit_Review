AbstractHypertension, a modifiable risk factor of cardiovascular disease, is largely responsible for the disproportionate morbidity and mortality in black women. Black women 20 years of age and older have a higher prevalence of HTN compared to white women (44% vs 28%). Poor adherence and non‐adherence to hypertensive medications have been strongly indicated as a primary contributor to the early onset of disparity in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality experienced by black people. The purpose of this study was to examine medication adherence in black women relative to sociodemographic, clinical, cultural context, psychosocial, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This was a prospective, descriptive cross‐sectional study of N = 85, hypertensive black women, with mean age of 39 ± 5.4 years, 18‐45 years of age. Variables and measures included: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical, adverse social stressors, psychosocial, cognitive‐behavioral factors, and medication adherence. Descriptive statistics, correlations, multivariate logistic regressions, and moderation analysis were tested. 81.2% (n = 69) of the sample was categorized as non‐adherent. SBP was the only clinical covariate associated with HTN medication adherence. HTN illness perceptions, composite score, resilient coping, depressive symptoms, exposure to lifetime gender, and racial stressors, were not associated with HTN medication adherence. Using multivariate logistic regression, decreased SBP and lower scores on the “Consequence” dimension of the HTN illness perception scale were associated with medication adherence (χ2 = 10.53, P = .001). Adherence was associated with both the “Consequence” and “Identity” dimensions of the HTN illness perception scale indicating the need and importance for clinicians to have open and honest communication regarding HTN and its treatment in facilitating adherence.
