A few of the resilience indices described in an earlier paper in this series are calculated for several reservoir configurations which constitute a set of sample plans for a river basin. Basin characteristics are introduced to estimate proposed surrogates of system resilience without the necessity of performing long and expensive simulation studies; these simulations are necessary to develop resilience indices for the sample basins and to compare them to a few conventional ranking functions. The objective is to determine if conventional indices replicate information contained in resilience indices and the extent to which either or both of these can be estimated from basin geometry. While imperfect, the results are encouraging and suggest areas for continuing work in the mapping of basin characteristics and configuration into performance indices.
