AbstractExperts in many domains are studying the concept of resilience, that is, the ability of a system to maintain required capability in the face of an adversity. The purpose of the paper is to explore how resilience related considerations vary among different application domains. Domains examined include civil systems, military systems, cyber space, natural systems, and organizational systems. One factor in how domains differ is how the system reacts or adapts to an adversity, which may be natural or human‚Äêmade or internal to the system itself. Domains differ with respect to the timeframes in which the system engages the adversity. The system of systems context can either be a hindrance or a benefit to resilience. Recovery can be accomplished through architectural and design techniques suitable for the system and the scenario at hand. This paper concludes that resilience as described in all domains are contextually appropriate manifestations of resilience.
