ABSTRACTThis paper discusses the role of organizational records management (ORM) with respect to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and argues about its necessity and significance. The current trend is to utilize AI to explain AI, including both explanation production and provision. We argue that this kind of approach is not sufficient by itself as it lacks neutrality and localness to explanation recipients, thus ineffective in establishing public trust. We propose the addition of the ORM profession, as an informational 3rd party, to the current and future XAI. We envision that, by working together with XAI performers, ORM contributes to an information resilient AI society. To take on the related responsibilities, the ORM profession must improve its professional expertise and strengthen its professional independence. We call for consensus among individual information professionals and the advocacy of information professional networks to make this vision a reality.
