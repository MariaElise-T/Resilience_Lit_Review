AbstractAnderson details her transition from a career as a management consultant to the chief executive officer (CEO) position of Global Health Corps (GHC), which is “a leadership development and global health nonprofit committed to building the next generation of health equity leaders.” She describes the high levels of resilience required within herself and throughout the organization during the COVID‐19 pandemic. She describes status versus dynamic resilience, and what the latter means for equity‐driven leaders. She outlines and describes “key tactics have helped me build my own, my teams’, and our community’s dynamic resilience during this time.” In her words, they are (1) tap into the power of imagination, (2) prioritize connection and reflection, (3) show vulnerability, (4) model and codify self‐care, (5) redefine urgency, and (6) let your values guide you. For instance, within point 3, Anderson writes, “The transition from a behind‐the‐scenes architect of GHC’s programming to an external face of our organization as CEO over the past couple years has forced me to get more comfortable with demonstrating vulnerability than ever before.” And within point 4: “I’ve found that the single most powerful tool I have for fostering self‐care and boundary setting on my team is to practice it myself, without apology.”
