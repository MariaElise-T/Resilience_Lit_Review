To achieve efficient personalized production at an affordable cost, a modular manufacturing system (MMS) can be utilized. MMS enables restructuring of its configuration to accommodate product changes and is thus an efficient solution to reduce the costs involved in personalized production. A micro smart factory (MSF) is an MMS with heterogeneous production processes to enable personalized production. Similar to MMS, MSF also enables the restructuring of production configuration; additionally, it comprises cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) that help achieve resilience. However, MSFs need to overcome performance hurdles with respect to production control. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based production control method. This method replaces the existing dispatching rule in the type and instance phases of the MSF. In this method, the RL policy network is learned and evaluated by coordination between DT and RL. The DT provides virtual event logs that include states, actions, and rewards to support learning. These virtual event logs are returned based on vertical integration with the MSF. As a result, the proposed method provides a resilient solution to the CPPS architectural framework and achieves appropriate actions to the dynamic situation of MSF. Additionally, applying DT with RL helps decide what-next/where-next in the production cycle. Moreover, the proposed concept can be extended to various manufacturing domains because the priority rule concept is frequently applied.
