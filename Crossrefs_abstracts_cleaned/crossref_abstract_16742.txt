<p>Because of multiple psychological-physical symptoms and failure to accept the reality, multiple sclerosis (MS), patients are suffering from negative mood disorders and fatigue which affects their life quality negatively. Therefore this study has been conducted to determine the effect of Dohsa Psycho-Motor Rehabilitation Method on fatigue severity, sleep quality, and Resilience promotion of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in Isfahan, Iran. A quasi-experimental study with pre-test, post-test and follow up was administered on both the experimental and control groups. The population consisted of all patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in Isfahan with clinical and MS society records. By purposive sampling 30 patients were selected for the experimental (n=15) and control (n=15) groups. Patients completed fatigue (FSS), Scale of sleep quality (PSQI) and Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) questionnaire before the beginning of the treatment (pretest) and also later for post-test. Dohsa treatment duration was ten sessions, three sessions per week and their post test was administered 30 days later. Finally, data were analyzed using SPSS18. The results of the multivariable covariance analysis showed that Dohsa Psycho-Motor Rehabilitation Method decreases fatigue severity, increases quality of sleep, and resilience of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (p&lt;0.001). Since MS disease has led to widespread symptoms and different clinical signs, MS patients may need psychological rehabilitation in the future, therefore Dohsa Psycho-Motor Rehabilitation Method is an effective treatment for reducing fatigue, improving sleep quality and increasing the resilience of multiple sclerosis patients.</p>
