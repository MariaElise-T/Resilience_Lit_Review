AbstractThe development of artificial organs and implants demands new materials with both processability and functionality. A series of star like poly(CL‐co‐TOSUO) copolymers with different molecular weights are synthesized via ring‐opening polymerization. The polymers are modified with norbornene end groups for rapid photo‐crosslinking. Due to the random insertion of 1,4,8‐trioxaspiro‐[4,6]‐9‐undecanone and well‐constructed permanent chemical network, the photo‐crosslinked elastomers are more flexible and resilient than conventional poly(ε‐caprolactone), with 84% resilience above the melting point. Their thermal and mechanical properties can be fine‐tuned by varying the molecular weights of the precursors. The polymer can be fabricated into complex shapes by digital light processing 3D printing. Combined with good cytocompatibility and degradability, the highly flexible elastomers show great potential for tissue engineering.
