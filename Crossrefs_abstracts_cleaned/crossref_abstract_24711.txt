Leadership personnel in the German military police are often responsible for units that are frequently exposed to highly stressful situations due to their tasks and skills. As German military leaders are expected to take care of and support their subordinates, they need to know how resilience can be increased and trained. This article presents a resilience training concept for leaders in the German military police. The result is a 1-week resilience training course consisting of psychoeducational knowledge, practical training parts, and measures for sustainability. Subsequently, it was validated and scientifically evaluated with German military police officers (n=19). The high degree of target group orientation was deemed necessary and expedient. Further objectives are to adapt the concept to the needs of other military target groups and to increase its sustainability.
