Enhancing the resilience of territorial space is a necessary means to cope with future risks and development uncertainties. Resilience is the goal and connotation of implementing monitoring of territorial space planning, and planning supervision is the guarantee for the formation of resilient territorial space. Although domestic and foreign planning implementation monitoring has reflected resilience thinking in the background and objectives, it has achieved good results in ecological and social resilience of territorial space, there are still shortcomings in institutional systems and methodological techniques. At present, China’s territorial space planning is still in the exploratory stage, and the supervision and implementation system has not been perfected, which has not played the expected role in enhancing the resilience of territorial space. Therefore, with a focus on the development of China’s economy and society, it is necessary to build an efficient monitoring system for the implementation of territorial space based on China’s national conditions, and improve it in terms of ideology,, theoretical, policy, regulatory, methods and techniques, in order to promote the modernization of China’s territorial space governance and the construction of an ecological civilization system, and also provide reference for the spatial planning of other countries.
