The disaster had caused some psychological problems in the teenagers living in several boarding schools in these regions. To deal with this, measures should be taken to bring the teenagers’ mental condition back to normal with an effort known as resilience. This study concerned on the resilience of the teenagers studying in the boarding schools of the 2016 earthquake affected areas. The study aimed to investigate the teenagers’ responses who, at the time of the disaster, lived separatedly from the family.
