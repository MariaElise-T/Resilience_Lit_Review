This review comprehensively examines the role of millets as a sustainable and resilient food source in the context of global climate change and escalating food security challenges. Millets, a group of small-seeded grasses traditionally grown in semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia, are re-emerging as crops of significance due to their remarkable adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and their rich nutritional profile. The review begins by outlining the various types of millets, including pearl, finger, and foxtail millet, and their geographic distribution, emphasizing their adaptability to diverse climatic conditions. It then delves into the nutritional aspects of millets, highlighting their high content of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and essential amino acids, making them a potent solution to combat malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies prevalent in many developing regions. A critical focus is placed on the climate resilience of millets. Their exceptional drought tolerance, ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, lower water, and nutrient requirements compared to staple crops like wheat and rice, and resistance to pests and diseases underscore millets' potential as sustainable crops in increasingly unpredictable climatic scenarios. This resilience not only promises to bolster food security but also contributes to sustainable agricultural practices. It explores the challenges and limitations in millet cultivation, processing, consumer acceptance, and market integration. It highlights the current gaps in millet-focused agricultural policies, the need for improved processing technologies, and strategies to enhance consumer appeal and marketability. Innovations in millet breeding for enhanced traits, advances in processing technologies, and the impact of biotechnology and climate-smart agricultural practices are examined. These technological and scientific advancements present opportunities for overcoming existing challenges and enhancing the role of millets in global food systems. Also presents case studies from various countries, particularly India, illustrating successful initiatives in millet cultivation, integration into national food policies, and community-led efforts. These examples offer valuable insights into practical approaches for promoting millets.
