Objectives  The purpose of this study was conducted to determine the degree of resilience, self-efficacy, and clinical practice stress in nursing students, and to identify the relationship between them.
Methods  The subjects of the study were 3rd and 4th year nursing students in D City, After explained the purpose and method of the study, and then collected data from the subjects who agreed to the study, and finally analyzed the data of 201 people. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA, scheff√© test, Pearson correlation coefficients analysis using the SPSS/WIN 22.0 statistical program.
Results  Out of 5 points, resilience was 3.60 points, self-efficacy was 3.75 points, and clinical practice stress was 3.05 points. Resilience and self-efficacy according to the general characteristics of nursing students were sig-nificantly different in grade, religion, health status, and satisfaction with nursing majors, and clinical practice stress was different in age, grade, religion, and health status. The correlation between them was positive for resilience and self-efficacy (r=.826, p=.000), negative for resilience and clinical practice (r=-458, p=.000), and negative for self-efficacy and clinical practice stress (r=-414, p=.000).
Conclusions  The resilience and self-efficacy of nursing students were above normal, and the clinical practice stress was moderate, and a significant correlation was found between resilience, self-efficacy, and clinical prac-tice stress, and it was confirmed that the higher the resilience and self-efficacy, the lower the clinical practice stress of nursing students. Therefore, in order to reduce clinical practice stress, the department needs to develop and apply curricula and comparative programs that improve the resilience and self-efficacy of nursing students.
