AbstractOvarian cancer is a life‐threatening diagnosis which poses multiple challenges. The purpose of this study is to describe the quality of life (QOL) concerns and survivorship sequelae of long‐term (>5 yr) early‐stage ovarian cancer survivors accrued through the clinical cooperative Gynecologic Oncology Group. Forty‐nine ovarian cancer survivors with a mean age at diagnosis of 55.9 yr (range 30–76) completed a telephone interview assessing QOL, psychosocial status, sexual functioning and late‐effects of treatment. Results indicate that this disease‐free early‐stage sample enjoys a good QOL, with physical, emotional, and social well‐being comparable to other survivors and same‐aged noncancer cohorts. However, 20% of survivors indicated the presence of long‐term treatment side effects, with a subset reporting problems related to abdominal and gynecologic symptoms, and neurotoxicity. Spiritual well‐being was significantly positively associated with personal growth and mental health, and negatively associated with a declining health status. Lingering psychological survivorship sequelae included fear of follow‐up diagnostic tests and fear of recurrence. Forty‐three percent of respondents expressed that they would likely participate in a counseling program today to discuss psychosocial issues raised by having had ovarian cancer, and 56% stated that they would have attended a support program during the initial treatment if it had been offered. This information provides some insight into the complex survivorship relationships between quality of life, long‐term physical and sexual sequelae, and factors of resilience and growth which appear to promote a sense of well‐being as a result of the cancer experience.
