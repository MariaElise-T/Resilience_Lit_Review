This article aims to analyze foreign and Russian studies on the academic resilience of migrant children. It provides the main definitions of the concept and discusses the existing methods of measuring academic resilience, their possibilities and limitations, and prospects for further research. Subjective and objective criteria for identifying "academically resilient" students are analyzed. Various factors influencing the manifestation of resilience by migrant children are considered. It is shown that the presence of external support, combined with the ability to ask for it and to accept it, has a positive effect on academic achievements. At the same time, such internal factors as self-efficacy, assertiveness, internal locus of control, high motivation and ambitious goals make a significant contribution to ensuring high academic performance even under unfavorable living conditions of a migrant child.
