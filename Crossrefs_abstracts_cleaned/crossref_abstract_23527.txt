Resilience is the capability to promptly recover from damage caused by a disturbance. In recent years, “resilience engineering” has been drawing attention as a new concept in the disaster prevention and crisis management field. Resilience engineering is a method for improving resilience through actions and responses on a case-by-case basis. It is based around social and technological systems, and includes both individuals and organizations. When a system encounters an unprecedented situation, this method involves avoiding the worst-case scenario based on “responding ability,” “monitoring ability,” “anticipating ability,” and “learning ability.” This paper introduces an application case for early recovery planning related to road networks damaged by an earthquake using the resilience engineering method. It also discusses the utility of the resilience engineering method and its future deployment for increasing disaster resilience.
