SummarySustainability and resilience are issues that are recognized worldwide, and increased attention should be placed on strategies to design and maintain infrastructure systems that are hazard resilient, damage tolerant, and sustainable. In this paper, a methodology to evaluate the seismic sustainability and resilience of both conventional and base‐isolated steel buildings is presented. Furthermore, the proposed approach is used to explore the difference between the performance associated with these buildings by considering the three pillars of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. Sustainability and resilience are both considered to cover a comprehensive performance‐based assessment content. The uncertainties associated with performance and consequence evaluation of structural and non‐structural components are incorporated within the assessment process. The proposed performance‐based assessment approach is illustrated on conventional and base‐isolated steel buildings under given seismic scenarios. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
