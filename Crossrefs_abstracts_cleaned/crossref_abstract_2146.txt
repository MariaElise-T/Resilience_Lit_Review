Since early 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has attacked many business sectors in many countries. In Indonesia, the government reacts to this situation by issuing several regulations, one of which is the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) regulation. This regulation affects many business sectors, including Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) sectors. KIBS sectors have been developing quickly, especially in developing countries like Indonesia. Knowledge plays a crucial part for KIBS firms as these firms depend heavily on their workersâ€™ knowledge. In this study, Lembaga Pelatihan Kerja Mitra Kalyana Sejahtera (LPK MKS) is being used as the research object for conducting the research. LPK MKS is a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) training firm, which included as one of KIBS business sectors. This study uses case study methodology by focusing on obtaining deep understandings about the knowledge management practices in KIBS training firm. The author obtains all the necessary data through in-depth qualitative interviews and secondary data. From the collected and analysed data, LPK MKS has implemented all of the success factors for managing knowledge. While the implementation of leadership and ICT are more notable, the implementation in organisational infrastructure is still not ideal. Nonetheless, the overall implementations of knowledge management help the firm in surviving the COVID-19 pandemic era and creating resiliency to face the new normal condition.
