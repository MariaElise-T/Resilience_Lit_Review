This special issue presents interdisciplinary and innovative perspectives on family and individual resilience. In this introduction, the authors provide an overview of this collection of conceptual and empirical articles that are organized by four categories: families as contexts, families as systems, intervention and policy implications, and methodological considerations. In addition, the authors highlight how resilience was conceptualized and operationalized in these works. This special issue is intended to stimulate the further study of family and individual resilience, especially research that focuses on interdisciplinary collaboration which we feel will only enhance the understanding of this area of research.
