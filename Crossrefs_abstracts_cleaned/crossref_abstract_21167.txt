AbstractStress resilience, and behavioural and cardiovascular impacts of chronic stress, are theorised to involve integrated neuro‐endocrine/inflammatory/transmitter/trophin signalling. We tested for this integration, and whether behaviour/emotionality, together with myocardial ischaemic tolerance, are consistently linked to these pathways across diverse conditions in male C57Bl/6 mice. This included Restraint Stress (RS), 1 h restraint/day for 14 days; Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS), seven stressors randomised over 21 days; Social Stress (SS), 35 days social isolation with brief social encounters in final 13 days; and Control conditions (CTRL; un‐stressed mice). Behaviour was assessed via open field (OFT) and sucrose preference (SPT) tests, and neurobiology from frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampal transcripts. Endocrine factors, and function and ischaemic tolerance in isolated hearts, were also measured. Model characteristics ranged from no behavioural or myocardial changes with homotypic RS, to increased emotionality and cardiac ischaemic injury (with apparently distinct endocrine/neurobiological profiles) in CUMS and SS models. Highly integrated expression of HPA axis, neuro‐inflammatory, BDNF, monoamine, GABA, cannabinoid and opioid signalling genes was confirmed across conditions, and consistent/potentially causal correlations identified for (i) locomotor activity (noradrenaline, ghrelin; FC Crhr1, Tnfrsf1b, Il33, Nfkb1, Maoa, Gabra1; hippocampal Il33); (ii) thigmotaxis (adrenaline, leptin); (iii) anxiety‐like behaviour (adrenaline, leptin; FC Tnfrsf1a; hippocampal Il33); (iv) depressive‐like behaviour (ghrelin; FC/hippocampal s100a8); and (v) cardiac stress‐resistance (noradrenaline, leptin; FC Il33, Tnfrsf1b, Htr1a, Gabra1, Gabrg2; hippocampal Il33, Tnfrsf1a, Maoa, Drd2). Data support highly integrated pathway responses to stress, and consistent adipokine, sympatho‐adrenergic, inflammatory and monoamine involvement in mood and myocardial disturbances across diverse conditions.
