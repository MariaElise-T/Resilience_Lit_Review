 This article explores conflicts, confrontations and conduits for sustainable development in rural environments. Fragility and degradation with a slight resilience manifest heavily in Gokwe South Rural District (GSRD), Zimbabwe. The article notes rural development as a double-edged sword, bringing tremendous opportunities for innovation but also causing increased ecological degradation. As such, it often results in conflicts and confrontations among stakeholders. Like many Zimbabwean rural settlements, GSRD is experiencing serious land disputes. conflicts arise from the proposed changes, like extension of infrastructure, perceived by some stakeholders as contrary to their interests and wishes. Using focus group discussions and thematic analysis, a trend of how conflicts and confrontations emerged was established in GSRD. The findings show that land transition from rural to urban status without consultations instigates conflict between different development agencies and communities.
