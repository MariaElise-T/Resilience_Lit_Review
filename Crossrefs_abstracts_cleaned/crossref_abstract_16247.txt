Abstract
We investigate coastal wetland ecosystem resilience to sea level rise by modelling sea level rise trajectories and the impact on vegetation communities for a coastal wetland in South Africa. The rate of sediment accretion was modelled relative to IPCC sea level rise estimates for multiple RCP scenarios. For each scenario, inundation by neap and spring tide and the 2, 4, and 8 year recurrence interval water level was modelled over a period of 200 years. When tidal variation is considered, the rate of sediment accretion exceeds rising sea levels associated with climate change, resulting in no major changes in terms of inundation. When sea level rise scenarios were modelled in conjunction with recurrence interval water levels, flooding of the coastal wetland was much greater than current levels at 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 year events. In the long term, increases in salinity may cause a reduction in Phragmites australis cover. Very small increases in depth and frequency of inundation are likely to cause an expansion of samphire species at the expense of Juncus spp. The study suggests that for this wetland, variability in flow may be a key factor in balancing wetland resilience.
