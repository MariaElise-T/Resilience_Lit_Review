AbstractThis essay examines Denise Minaâ€™s Garnethill trilogy from the standpoint of spatial and capabilities studies. It analyzes the representation of spaces of resilience and their role in the gendered redistribution of urban and domestic power portrayed in the narratives. In order to do so, it contextualizes these books within the framework of contemporary Scottish crime fiction and subsequently studies the contraposition and subversion of emotional spaces in Glasgow and London in the process of recovery from the trauma of the child sexual abuse their protagonist has undergone.
