The purpose of this study is to verify the mediating effects of resilience between social workers’ job stress and service quality. For this, survey data was collected from 300 social workers working in social welfare facilities in Daejeon, Korea. The collected data were analyzed with the SPSS 18.0 program, and multiple regression and Sobel tests were conducted. The analysis results are as follows. First, social workers’ job stress had an effects to reduce service quality. Second, results verified that resilience had a mediating effect between job stress and service quality. Therefore, it is analyzed that social workers’ resilience would reduce the negative effect of job stress on service quality. This implies that not only job stress but also resilience is an important factor in service quality. Based on these findings, I present a few suggestions to manage job stress and enhance the resilience of social workers.
