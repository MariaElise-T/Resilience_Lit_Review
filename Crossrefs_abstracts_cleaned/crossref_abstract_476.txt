(1) Background: Despite that nursing college students are more diverse than those in other majors, many nurses experience interpersonal problems and difficulties in the process of forming relationships and contacting various people. The purpose of this study is to understand the mediating effects of aggression on the process of ego-resilience in interpersonal problems in nursing college students. (2) Methods: The subjects of this study were 182 nursing college students attending university in D metropolitan city. Data were collected from 23 October to 9 November 2018. The measurements were carried out using the Ego-Resiliency Scale, the Aggression Questionnaireâ€”Korean Version (AQ-K), and the short form of the KIIP Complex Scale (KIIP-SC). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and ANOVA. The methods of Baron and Kenny were used to verify the significance of the mediating effect. (3) Results: There were significant correlations among ego-resiliency, aggression, and interpersonal problems. Aggression had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between ego-resiliency and interpersonal problems, and aggression was explained to a level of 23%. (4) Conclusions: To lower interpersonal problems among nursing students, it is necessary to develop education and programs to improve ego-resiliency and to control aggression.
