Objectives: This study was a descriptive research study to understand the mediating effect of career decision-making self-efficacy in the relationship between job seeking stress and ego-resilience of nursing students. Methods: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire from 130 students with clinical practice in the 3rd and 4th grade of nursing university and college located in Daegu Metropolitan City. Results: The degree of the indirect effect of job seeking stress on ego-resilience through career decision-making self-efficacy was -0.18 (95% CI = -0.32, -0.06). The degree of the direct effect of job seeking stress on ego-resilience -0.30 (95% CI = -0.43, -0.16). In other words, it was demonstrated that career decision-making self-efficacy mediated the relationship between job seeking stress and ego-resilience for nursing students. Conclusions: Through this study, the mediation of career decision-making self-efficacy was confirmed in the relationship between job seeking stress and ego-resilience perceived by nursing students. Therefore, repeated research is required along with the development and application of career decision-making self-efficacy improvement program to increase the ego-resilience of nursing students.
