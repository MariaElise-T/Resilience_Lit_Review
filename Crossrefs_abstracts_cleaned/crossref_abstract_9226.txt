Morocco has experienced many weather events that have been increasingly aggravated by climate change, a global, irreversible and anthropogenic phenomenon. They have a major impact on the main sectors of the economy and on the infrastructure. The objective of the study is to propose adaptation options and the plan for their implementation to improve the resilience of certain infrastructure to climate risk, a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the smooth functioning of the city. The methodological approach used is the quantitative approach which consists in quantifying the selected indicators attributed to the key elements of the impact chains and normalizing, weighting and aggregating them in order to obtain as desired results the vulnerability and climate risk scores in the form of tables and interactive maps of the study area for a better interpretation (Very low, low, medium, high, very high). On the basis of these results, effective and operational adaptation measures will be suggested. Thus, having a plan for implementing adaptation options is vitally important for a city to be resilient and less vulnerable to climate risk.
