This paper explores the spatial impact of green infrastructure (GI) location on the resilience of urban drainage systems by the application of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). A framework that integrates resilience assessment, location sensitivity analysis and ESDA is presented and applied to an urban catchment in the United Kingdom. Three types of GI, namely a bioretention cell, permeable pavement, and green roof, are evaluated separately and simultaneously. Resilience is assessed using stress-strain tests, which measure the system performance based on the magnitude and duration of sewer flooding and combined sewer overflows. Based on the results of a location sensitivity analysis, ESDA is applied to determine if there is spatial autocorrelation, spatial clusters, and spatial outliers. Results show a stronger spatial dependency using sewer flooding indicators. Different GI measures present differences in spatial autocorrelation and spatial cluster results, highlighting the differences in their underlying mechanisms. The finding of conflicting spatial clusters indicates that there are trade-offs in the placement of GI in certain locations. The proposed framework can be used as a tool for GI spatial planning, helping in the development of a systematic approach for resilience-performance orientated GI design and planning.
