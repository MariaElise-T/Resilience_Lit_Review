The resiliency of gymnasium floors, as well as slipperiness and durability, should be regarded as one of the most important measures of its performance from the viewpoint of athletes' psychology and physiology. A fundamental investigation of the resiliency of gymnasium floors was carried out based on the relations between dynamic deflections of gymnasium floors measured with a newly developed apparatus for measuring resiliency and athletes' sense of resiliency scaled by means of the sensory test. From the result of the correspondence between the athletes' preference scale of resiliency and physical characteristics of gymnasium floors, the resiliency of gymnasium floors is defined as follows: Resiliency of gymnasium floors consists of softness, repulsion, and vibration damping. Softness, repulsion, and vibration damping of floors are found to correspond to the physical characteristics of gymnasium floors measured with newly developed apparatus. Then, the estimating equation, which consists of a preference scale of resiliency and the physical characteristics of gymnasium floors, is presented, and the most suitable value of resiliency for gymnasium floor proposed.
