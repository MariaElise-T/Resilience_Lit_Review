In order to study academic performance, dropout, and enrollment breakdown in higher education, attention is generally focused on the socioeconomic aspects and family environment of the students, resorting to hypotheses and explanations of a complex situation and analyzing external variables that influence on student behavior. This presentation analyses the resilience of university students in the first years of UNaM faculties, namely Bachelor of Business Administration (LAE), Bachelor of Economics (LE) and Certified Public Accountant (CP) of the Faculty of Economics (FCE), as will be described in the body of the text. Using online surveys, qualitative features of the group were delineated regarding the topic of interest and quantitative parameters were obtained to describe its demographic characteristics. The results show that the students perceive themselves as highly resilient, they state that they usually find a way out of a difficulty, they maintain their interest, they feel friends with themselves and they question themselves about the relevance of the contents that make up the curricula of the subjects they study. To a large extent, the lack of equanimity is a characteristic that would define these students.
