Floods are among the most common and destructive natural disasters confronted by cities and are further aggravated by rapid climate change and increasing urbanization, posing a great challenge to flood risk management. To cope with uncertainty, there is a need to move towards approaches to managing flood risk by taking resilience into consideration. While the evaluation of urban flood resilience has gained much attention in recent decades, studies on quantitative measurement using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches are rare. In addition, the results determined by different MCDM methods may exhibit considerable variability. It is an intractable task to gather a group consensus from these methods. In this regard, in this paper, we propose a group-decision-making framework for measuring urban resilience to flooding, combining three stages, which are (i) normalizing the data, (ii) weighting the criteria and (iii) aggregating the results. Four objective MCDM methods—i.e., the variation coefficient method, Shannon weighting method, CRITIC and ideal point method—are proposed and treated as reliable methods. A stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis is adopted to integrate those results into a composite resilience index. The proposed methodology is applied to the resilience evaluation problem of 41 cities in the Yangtze River basin, and the results are compared with those obtained with the four MCDM methods. It is demonstrated that our method considers all possible preferences among the results provided by various MCDM methods and is thus more robust and acceptable.
