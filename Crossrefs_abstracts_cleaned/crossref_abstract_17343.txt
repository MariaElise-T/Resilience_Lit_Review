Background:Antenatal care (ANC) is care provided to pregnant women in order to ensure positive health outcomes for both mother and baby. Late ANC contact lacks the opportunity to provide interventions that are effective early in the pregnancy. A huge proportion of pregnant women present late. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of late enrollment in the ANC among pregnant women in public health centers in Ilu Ababor Zone, South-West Ethiopia.Design and methods:A facility-based case-control study was conducted on 270 randomly selected pregnant women (135 cases and 135 controls). A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Multi-variable logistic regression was run to identify the determinants of late ANC initiation. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine statistical significance at a P-value of 0.05.Result:A total of 270 pregnant women were interviewed, making a response rate of 97%. Unplanned pregnancy [AOR: 2.8; 95% CI: (1.3, 6.0)], lack of information on time of ANC initiation [AOR: 2.7; 95% CI:(1.02, 5.0)], older age [AOR: 2.2; 95% CI:(1.01, 4.7)], not attending ANC in the previous pregnancy [AOR: 4.07; 95% CI: (1.8, 9.5)], and fear of COVID-19 were determinants of late initiation of ANC in the study area.Conclusion:Age, pregnancy and care-related factors, and fear of COVID-19 were determinants of late initiation of ANC. Community-based provision of comprehensive information on planned pregnancy and the ANC is important. A resilient system has to be built to deliver essential health services during emergencies like COVID-19.
