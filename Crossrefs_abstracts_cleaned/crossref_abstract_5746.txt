Transition from primary school to secondary school represents a period of great change and uncertainty for young people and much research has been done on the importance of providing consistency of support during this time. This paper describes an intervention designed to promote resilience in a class of 24 Primary 7 pupils in preparation for their eventual transition to secondary school. Resilience is viewed not as a fixed concept but as dynamic and malleable, based on the idea that effective intervention can trigger resilient responses in children and young people.
