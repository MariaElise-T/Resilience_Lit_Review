Hospital disaster resilience assessment is a process of analysing the condition of the site, building, people and operations through a checklist of indicators (i.e., structural, non-structural and functional). As in 2011, Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction has been established with twofold objectives: 1) by 2011, assessments on the safety of existing hospital facilities to be undertaken and 2) by 2015, action plans for hospitals should be developed and implemented in disaster prone countries. Howbeit the initiative was established, valid instruments for assessing resilience of existing hospital are lacking particularly in Malaysia. Hence, the objective of the paper is to evaluate the content validity of the disaster resilience hospital assessment instrument. Two methods were employed in the form of document analysis (7 instruments) and CVR & CVI questionnaire (6 experts). Based on the document analysis, 129 elements with three main constructs are suggested to be incorporated in the instrument. The CVR scores revealed that 48 out of 129 items are regarded as the utmost critical (structural - 2; non-structural - 7; and functional - 39). The findings for I-CVI and modified kappa coefficient however revealed that 122 items in the instrument are appropriate and excellent. The remaining seven items values are considered fair and poor and recommended to be eliminated. In addition, based on the S-CVI/Ave it is revealed that the content validity of the proposed instrument is adequate. As for this reason, it is noteworthy that the instrument to be highly regarded for evaluating the existing hospitalsâ€™ resilience.
