AbstractAimThis study aimed to adopt online mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) training to increase the resilience of nursing interns and help them to achieve a smooth transition.DesignA one‐group pretest‐posttest study design was used.MethodsA total of 119 college nursing interns were recruited from 12 tertiary hospitals in Beijing on Feb.20, 2021. The MBSR training was organized into 4 weeks of courses, conducted online using Tencent Meeting and taught by a certified teacher at the Oxford Mindfulness Centre. Resilience was assessed before and 2 weeks after the training, respectively, using Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents via an online questionnaire tool.ResultsSeventy‐nine college nursing interns finished both of the resilience questionnaire surveys. The mean resilience values before and after the training were 98.7 ± 13.69 and 104.57 ± 16.64 respectively. The 4‐week online MBSR training considerably increased the resilience of nursing interns. This can be an effective measure to maintain a balanced state among nursing interns and help them smoothly transition from school to clinical practice.No Patient or Public Contribution.
