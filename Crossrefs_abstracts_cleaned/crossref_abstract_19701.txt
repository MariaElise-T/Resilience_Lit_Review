Purpose: This article reports on an examination of the psychometric properties of the 28-item Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28). Methods: Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach’s α, t-tests, correlations, and multivariate analysis of variance were applied to data collected via interviews from 593 at-risk adolescents (12–17 years) to identify the factor structure, internal consistency, test–retest reliability, construct validity, and floor and ceiling effects of the CYRM-28. Results: A four-factor structure was identified comprising two contextual factors, individual and family factors. The CYRM-28 and its factors show good internal reliability, stable test–retest properties, and no floor or ceiling effects. The measure also showed good construct validity. Discussion: The CYRM-28 shows good overall validity on this group of New Zealand youth, and researchers and social workers can have some confidence in its usefulness as a measure that can be used to assess resilience in youth from a range of ethnic backgrounds.
