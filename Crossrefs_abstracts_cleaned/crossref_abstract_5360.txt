This study is a research conducted in the relational screening model aiming to examine the intermediary role of gender and income in the relationship between ego functions and resilience. The research was conducted with 251 participants who volunteered to participate among fourth-graders attending different undergraduate programs of a university. 49.8% of the participants were female, and 50.2% were male; the mean age was 23.6 years. The Resilience Scale for Adults and Ego Functions Assessment Scale were used as data collection tools in the research. Descriptive statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Multiple Regression Analysis were used in the analysis of data. Consequently, while resilience did not differ significantly in terms of gender, evaluating the truth from ego functions were found higher in men, and stimulant threshold and judgment were found to be higher in women. While it was determined that ego functions predicted resilience at a significant level, the intermediary role of gender and income level was not found in the relationship between ego functions and resilience. Consequently, it may be useful to consider ego functions as a variable in improving the resilience of young individuals.
