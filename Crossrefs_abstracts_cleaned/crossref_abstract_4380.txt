AbstractAlthough the environment has long been recognised as a key determinant of health, the linkages between urban living environments, immunological health and occurrence of infectious diseases are not well known. Healthy urban planning initiatives, especially in the Western world, have mostly been triggered by non-communicable diseases caused by lifestyle and dietary factors, such as diabetes. Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a significant body of research has been published that examines the impacts of pandemics on urban resilience, policy and planning practices. In this paper, we synthesise key lessons and preliminary insights for pandemic-proof cities in the light of recent academic discussion. Furthermore, we aim to address the urgent need for integrative approaches to urban resilience that consider human and environmental health holistically and contribute to comprehensive societal security.
