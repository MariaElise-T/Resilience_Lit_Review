Aim of study: Countries will be affected by climate change in different levels and ways. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on methods and options specific to regions. Basin approach, the sustainability of the basins and their capacity to be exposed to the possible effects of climate change, adapting to and resisting climate change should be addressed with an integrated approach. “Basin vulnerability analysis” methods are developed to ensure ecosystems sustainability and reveal their adaptive capacities. The purpose of these analyses is to calculate the basin’s vulnerability to all anthropogenic stress factors, especially climate change, for prioritizing investments and measures.
Area of study: This study applied in Balıkesir-Susurluk sub-basins.
Material and methods: This study applied a vulnerability analyses and mapped in Balıkesir-Susurluk sub-basins. The vulnerability analysis results were evaluated together with land use and resilience capacity.  
Main results: We obtained a high correlation (r2=0.788) between the vulnerability values and the water quality scores. The used method was verified and found to be successful and applicable. 
Highlights: The dissemination of the method with its application to other basins is critical in analyzing the vulnerability at the basin scale and directing the basin restoration investments.
