Abstract
Using a quantum tunneling derivation, we show the resilience of Hawking radiation in Lorentz violating gravity. In particular, we show that the standard derivation of the Hawking effect in relativistic quantum field theory can be extended to Lorentz breaking situations thanks to the presence of universal horizons (causal boundaries for infinite speed signals) inside black hole solutions. Correcting previous studies, we find that such boundaries are characterized by a universal temperature governed by their surface gravity. We also show that within the tunneling framework, given the pole structure and the tunneling path, only a vacuum state set in the preferred frame provides a consistent picture. Our results strongly suggest that the robustness of black hole thermodynamics is ultimately linked to the consistency of quantum field theories across causal boundaries.
