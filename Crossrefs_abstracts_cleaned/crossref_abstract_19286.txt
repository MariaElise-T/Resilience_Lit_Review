Migration is a psychosocial challenge, and migrants' transitory experiences in host countries are shaped by a combination of linked environmental factors. The absence of social aspects of resilience, as well as disciplinary limitations and biases, hinder the methodological rigor and flexibility needed to investigate social resilience as a phenomenon that occurs at the intersection of social, cultural, and political environments. Based on the social constructionist perspective, this paper identifies the need for a methodological mosaic and proposes a methodological guideline to investigate social resilience among migrants embedded in a multi-layered environment and person-environment interaction. The proposed methods include participant observation, biographical interviews, resilience diaries, focus groups, participants’ workshops, and expert conferencing. The inclusion of participantfriendly methods provides a space to listen to the voices of participants across the margins, and to engage experts and social workers in a participant-centered data examination. The concept of using a methodological mosaic in social resilience and migration studies provides a solid foundation for conducting multidisciplinary social science research. It gives the freedom to engage experts from various disciplinary backgrounds and benefits from diverse perspectives to connect the methodological pieces. The methodological mosaic described in this paper can be used to advance interconnected and participant-friendly data collection strategies and to gain a holistic understanding of migrants’ lived experiences. The paper, though a methodological proposal, contributes to broadening the methodological scope and integration in migration studies.
