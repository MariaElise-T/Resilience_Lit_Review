AbstractThe work at hand presents a new extensive panel dataset for energy economics, econometrics and policy. The referred dataset is made of 5000 observations circa, including 6 energy economics variables and the majority of the world’s countries (n = 136), extended for 6 years (2009–2014). Data can be used for diverse energy econometrics studies, especially for socioeconomic and environmental aspects of energy innovation and efficiency investigations. The analysed data can be exploited for further analyses to improve our understanding of resilience and vulnerability aspects of the domestic industry, examined at the global scale. To this end, several databases were chosen from the IEA, the World Bank and their partners. Data were collected, cleaned, treated, harmonised and analysed to return a new panel dataset. Both the new data organisation and the descriptor can be used as tools and guidance to perform sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurial inquiries and analyses, focusing on energy economics, econometrics and development policy.
