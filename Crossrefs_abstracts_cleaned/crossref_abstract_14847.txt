 This article presents an unprecedented concept for resilient bridge columns comprising precast modules designed for disassembly. Resiliency is provided by superelastic shape memory alloys that minimize permanent drift and engineered cementitious composite that minimizes damage, while keeping the rest of the column elastic. The precast modules consist of prefabricated plastic hinges and prefabricated concrete-filled fiber–reinforced polymer tubes. The columns are very desirable candidates for accelerated bridge construction. Two ¼-scale column models with engineered cementitious composite plastic hinges incorporating two types of shape memory alloy bars, one made of nickel–titanium and the other of copper–aluminum–manganese, were designed and tested under simulated earthquakes. To assess the influence of reusing column components, each of the models was first tested under a series of ground motions, and then the models were disassembled, inspected, reassembled, and subsequently retested. The reassembled models reached the same capacity as the original models but were more flexible. A simple modeling method was able to match the global measured response of the models with a reasonable accuracy.
