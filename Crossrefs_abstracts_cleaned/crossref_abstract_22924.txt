AbstractBackgroundTo test the psychometric properties of a traditional Chinese version of the Resilience Scale for Children (RS-10) and examine its factorial structure via a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).MethodsOne hundred and eighty-six Hong Kong Chinese children with cancer were recruited in the paediatric oncology units of two public acute-care hospitals in Hong Kong to participate in this cross-sectional study. The psychometric properties of the traditional Chinese version of the RS-10 were assessed, namely its content equivalence, convergent and discriminant validity, construct validity, internal consistency and test–retest reliability.ResultsThe newly translated traditional Chinese version of the RS-10 demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .83, McDonald’s Ω = .80), excellent test–retest reliability (.89), good content equivalence (CVI = 96%) and appropriate convergent (r =  − .52, P = .01) and discriminant validity (r = .61, P = .01). The CFA results demonstrated that there was a good fit between the factor structure of the Chinese version of the RS-10 and the observed data (χ2/df = 2.34, TLI = .951, RMSEA = .053, CFI = .962, GFI = .948, SRMR = .052), thereby confirming the construct validity of this instrument.ConclusionsThe traditional Chinese version of the RS-10 was found to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing the resilience of Hong Kong Chinese children with cancer. The newly developed traditional Chinese version of the RS-10 is an appropriate clinical research tool for evaluating the effectiveness of nursing interventions in enhancing the resilience of and promoting mental well-being in children with cancer.Trial registrationNCT03544190.
