Objectives: This exploratory study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the design of healthcare facilities, particularly those featuring communal spaces. It sought to identify strategies that were implemented, learned, or recognized when adapting to the limitations imposed by protective measures during the pandemic. Background: Third places are social gathering places outside of home and work. Over time, these community-centric places evolved from free-standing getaways to more integrated niches in diverse contexts including healthcare. Their numerous advantages for users include enhancing community bonds and collaboration among healthcare workers. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a need to rethink the design of such spaces to make them more adaptable and resilient. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted through in-depth semi-structured interviews with sixteen practitioners involved in healthcare architecture and design projects during the pandemic. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Findings indicate that the design of shared spaces in healthcare facilities for pandemic-like situations requires a special focus on modifiability and multifunctionality, achievable through strategies such as the use of movable, unconnected, and rearrangeable furniture or partitions that could swiftly change the function of a space. Other strategies include the capacity for compartmentalization of spaces, fostering indoorâ€“outdoor connections, integrating advanced technology, and implementing effective infection control measures. Detailed emergent themes and examples of experienced constraints are discussed. Conclusions: Insights gained from our findings can be applied to new and ongoing healthcare design projects to ensure resiliency during normal and pandemic conditions.
