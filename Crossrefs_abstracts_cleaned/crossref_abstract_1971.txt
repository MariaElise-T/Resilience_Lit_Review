This study attempts to understand how collaborative management could enhance and improve organizational leadership and elicit resilient behaviors. Thus, collaboration and resilience are basic characteristics that can help any organization surmount unpredictably challenging situations, and even thrive in the process. A systematic review was used in which relevant theories were examined in line with this objective. It was found that; cultivating, developing, and refining collaborative efforts in organizational leadership, employee-employer relationships, and organizational success are key factors in the pursuit and actualization of predetermined organizational objectives. This outcome demonstrates that leading successfully in an unpredictable and change-prone environment is a huge task. Hence, for organizational leadership to survive and thrive, it has to develop the capacity to be adaptive, swiftly recover from setbacks, maintain relatively stable and functional health, and harness all its resources to remain in business. Therefore, an organization that collaborates on several fronts will create a resilient spirit to face and surmount unpredictably challenging situations if/when they arise. Thus, organizations that intend to succeed in this regard must promote cohesion, diversity, interdependence, inclusion, and social support through enthusiastic and enterprising capabilities.
