The present study assessed the relationship between resilience, adherence, and transition readiness in adolescents/young adults with chronic illness. Participants included 50 patients (Mean age, Mage = 17.3 ± 2.1 years) diagnosed with an oncology disorder (n = 7; 12.1%), hematology disorder (n = 5; 8.6%), nephrology disorder (n = 31; 53.4%), or rheumatology disorder (n = 7; 12.1%). Patients were administered questionnaires assessing resilience (Conner–Davidson Resilience Scale 25-item questionnaire, CD-RISC-25), transition readiness (Self-Management and Transition to Adulthood with Rx=Treatment, STARx), and self-reported medication adherence (Medication Adherence Module, MAM). Medical chart reviews were conducted to determine objective medication adherence rates based on pharmacy refill history (medication adherence ratios). A multivariate correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between resilience, transition readiness, and adherence. There was a moderate relationship (r = 0.34, p ≤ 0.05) between resilience (M = 74.67 ± 13.95) and transition readiness (M = 67.55 ± 8.20), such that more resilient patients reported increased readiness to transition to adult care. There also was a strong relationship (r = 0.80, p ≤ 0.01) between self-reported medication adherence (M = 86.27% ± 15.98) and pharmacy refill history (Mean Medication Adherence Ratio, MMAR = 0.75 ± 0.27), which indicated that self-reported adherence was consistent with prescription refill history across pediatric illness cohorts. Our findings underscore the importance of assessing resilience, transition readiness, and adherence years before transitioning pediatric patients to adult providers to ensure an easier transition to adult care.
