            The current study explores the level and social determinants of resilience among Syrian refugees residing in Jordan. Having high levels of resilience can help refugees positively adapt to challenges and cope with the burden of stressors associated with warfare, turmoil, and displacement. A sample of 151 Syrian refugees ages 18 to 69 residing in Jordan completed the Arabic version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Resilience scores among Syrian refugees in Jordan were generally low. Refugees' place of residence, educational level, employment status, and monthly income were significantly associated with lower resilience scores and together explain approximately 37% of variance in resilience scores. Tailored resilience-building and educational programs are needed to help Syrian refugees develop the ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from stress and adversity, and maintain or return to healthy mental states. Future research involving longitudinal assessment of resilience is needed to fully understand the role and determinants of resilience in this population. [
