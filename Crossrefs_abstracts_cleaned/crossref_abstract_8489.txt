We designed a high power and ultra-wideband two-section 3â€‰dB coaxial hybrid coupler for load resilient ion cyclotron range of frequency heating by configuring asymmetric impedance matching using a three-dimensional simulation code, hfss. By adjusting the characteristic impedances of main and coupled lines of the hybrid coupler, we realized that the bandwidth of the proposed circuit is not only wider than that of a conventional three-section coupler, but also that the bandwidth is almost twice as wide compared to the conventional two-section hybrid coupler while maintaining the identical overall size.
