With the development of new energy sources and the increase in the installed scale of energy coupling equipment, the low-carbon transformation of the energy supply of the integrated energy system (IES) has a serious impact on the reliability of the IES supply, and there is an urgent need for a reasonable and accurate assessment and trade-off between the IES resilience and economics. In this regard, this paper models the overall optimization of the resilience and economic configuration and operation scheduling of the IES in the islanded operation mode after grid faults, proposes a two-layer optimization strategy model of resilience and economy, and solves the unit configuration, coupled output characteristics, and optimal scheduling of the islanded IES using the Markov decision-making process and forbearing stratified sequencing method, and evaluates and analyzes the resilience and cost of the various types of IES configuration schemes. Resilience and cost are also evaluated and analyzed. Finally, an example analysis is carried out in an electric-heat-cooling integrated energy system. The results show that the proposed two-tier optimization strategy model can optimize the IES configuration scheme and coordinate the scheduling of each equipment, and the overall annualized cost of the energy system decreases by CNY 45.21 thousand, or a percentage decrease of 5.24%, compared to the same configuration of the conventional strategy. The typical day toughness index improved by 7.33%, 7.56%, and 13.01% in the spring, summer, and autumn, respectively.
