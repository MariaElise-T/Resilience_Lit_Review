Aim. The aim of this study was to determine whether the relationship among the nursing work environment, psychological resilience, and transition shock was mediated by nurses’ perceived professional benefits and to explore the associations among these variables. Background. Nurses’ transition shock is an important factor in reducing the nursing staff turnover rate. Thus, clarifying the factors influencing nurses’ transition shock has become a priority. Methods. Cross-sectional research was used in this study. A total of 200 newly graduated Chinese nurses were recruited by convenience sampling in 2022 from three tertiary hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Data were collected through questionnaires and included demographic data in addition to the perceived professional benefit scale of nurses, the nursing work environment scale, the brief resilience scale, and the transition shock scale. The data were analysed using SPSS 25.0 and the SPSS PROCESS macro programme, Model 6. Results. The perceived professional benefit of new nurses, the nursing work environment, and psychological resilience directly influenced transition shock (

). The perceived professional benefit of new nurses mediated the relationship among the nursing work environment, psychological resilience, and transition shock (

). The final model’s mediating influence contributed 21.53% and 6.85% to the total influence. Conclusion. Nursing managers can improve nurses’ perceptions of professional benefits from psychological resilience and the nursing work environment to reduce the impact of transition from school to work for new nurses. Implications for Nursing Management. This study provides a reference for the development of intervention strategies and training programmes to assist new nurses in cancer hospitals in effectively navigating the transition into their careers. In the future, appropriate training methods should be used at the individual cognitive, psychological, and organizational levels to improve the physical and mental health of new nurses and their ability to provide high-quality patient care.
