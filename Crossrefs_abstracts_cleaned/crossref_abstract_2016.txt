 In the article, we propose a comprehensive model, which aims to enhance understanding of the contribution of sense of fear as a major response to continuous traumatic stress situations, and which addresses contextual factors as potential moderators of psychological distress and aggressive behavior. The research sample consisted of 1,290 children and adolescents living near a war zone, who filled out questionnaires relating to negative psychological consequences, as well as to the role of sense of fear, resilience resources, and sense of belonging to the school in mediating or moderating those consequences. The findings revealed that the direct effect of fear reactions on negative psychological consequences may vary with different levels of these moderators. The study highlights the role of the school as a substantial source of support for children and adolescents, which can lead to reduced levels of psychological distress and aggressive behavior.
