Theoretical work in resilience has continuously evolved to inform and respond to advances in empirical work. In order to further scientific inquiry, it must continue to do so. This narrative overview of the field of resilience science focuses on contemporary challenges confronted by theoretical models of individual resilience and proposes a taxonomic structure for resilience—the multidimensional taxonomy of individual resilience (MTIR). The goal of the MTIR is to articulate a systematic framework within which extant theoretical and empirical work can be nested. Consistent with existing work, the MTIR organizes resilience into two primary branches—manifested resilience and generative resilience. These two components are then organized into subdomains that demonstrate evidence of conceptual distinctiveness. The specification of the subdomains in the MTIR draws support from a diverse body of work on resilience across disciplines and in multiple global contexts. The MTIR makes several critical advances, including expanding and refining the definitions and components of resilience in psychology, providing a clearer framework for conceptualizing mixed profiles of resilience, and tempering assumptions regarding the relational dependencies across domains of resilience. Finally, the utility of the MTIR in organizing research in resilience and advancing theory-testing and development is discussed.
