AbstractThis paper describes an investigation into the factors influencing the resilient modulus and cumulative plastic strain of frozen silty clay. A series of dynamic triaxial tests are conducted to analyze the influence of the temperature, confining pressure, frequency, and compaction degree on the resilient modulus and cumulative plastic strain of frozen silty clay samples. The results show that when the temperature is below − 5 °C, the resilient modulus decreases linearly, whereas when the temperature is above − 5 °C, the resilient modulus decreases according to a power function. The resilient modulus increases logarithmically when the frequency is less than 2 Hz and increases linearly once the frequency exceeds 2 Hz. The resilient modulus increases as the confining pressure and compaction degree increase. The cumulative plastic strain decreases as the temperature decreases and as the confining pressure, frequency, and compaction degree increase. The research findings provide valuable information for the design, construction, operation, maintenance, safety, and management of airport engineering in frozen soil regions.
