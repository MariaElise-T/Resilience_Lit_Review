A genuine employment policy : a part a the industrial resilience of middle mountains in Auvergne 
The middle mountains industry in Auvergne is currently facing a lack of qualifications both due to insufficiency of local labour training and to the difficulty in attracting resources of other regions, specially skilled people. However, the industrial system didn't seem to suffer that much from this handicap and the characteristics of the local labour remain for the local managers one of the key advantages of their geographic situation. These two assessments, apparently contradictory, are indeed the cause and the consequence of a third one : the necessity in which many companies are to train themselves their staff had led them to implement a true employment policy, main element of the industrial resilience.
