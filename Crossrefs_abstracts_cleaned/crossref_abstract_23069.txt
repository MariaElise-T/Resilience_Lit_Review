 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in cardiovascular and neurologic disorders including atherosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Although oxidative stress can lead to apoptosis of vascular cells, such findings are largely based upon isolated vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) studied in culture. Studying intact resistance arteries, we have focused on understanding how SMCs and ECs in the blood vessel wall respond to acute oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, a ubiquitous, membrane-permeant ROS. We find that apoptosis induced by H2O2 is far greater in SMCs compared to ECs. For both cell types, apoptosis is associated with a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) during H2O2 exposure. Consistent with their greater death, the rise in [Ca2+]i for SMCs exceeds that in ECs. Finding that disruption of the endothelium increases SMC death, we address how myoendothelial coupling and paracrine signaling attenuate apoptosis. Remarkably, conditions associated with chronic oxidative stress (advanced age, Western-style diet) protect SMCs during H2O2 exposure, as does female sex. In light of intracellular Ca2+ handling, we consider how glycolytic versus oxidative pathways for ATP production and changes in mitochondrial structure and function impact cellular resilience to H2O2-induced apoptosis. Gaining new insight into protective signaling within and between SMCs and ECs of the arterial wall can be applied to promote vascular cell survival (and recovery of blood flow) in tissues subjected to acute oxidative stress as occurs during reperfusion following myocardial infarction and thrombotic stroke.
