Community-based tourism (CBT) has been adopted as an effective and practical solution to land use policies by governments that simultaneously pursue upgrading of local economy, conservation of local ecosystem and development of local communities. Confronting with new normality of detrimental eventualities in situated environments, destination management organizations (DMOs) or local governments have to employ effective governance strategies for fostering tourism community resilience in order to sustain development of CBT destinations. In viewing of that facilitating development through evaluation usually manifests as an efficient strategy in governance practices, this paper contributes to fill two main gaps in tackling comprehensive evaluation of tourism community resilience. Firstly, by noticing the fact that current literature overlooks processual characteristics of tourism community resilience, which originate from integration of disaster management and destination management (DM2), we have developed an analytical framework comprised of six attributes for comprehensively evaluating tourism community resilience. Secondly, aiming at the phenomena that cognitive assessments on attributes of tourism community resilience often exhibit complicate uncertainties caused by low-structured or ill-structured problem nature, we have put forward a powerful expression tool of probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy uncertain unbalanced linguistic set (PDHF_UUBLS) to simultaneously capture evaluatorsâ€™ cognitive characteristics of decision hesitancy, bipolar epistemic notions and relative importance among assessments. Then by formalizing comprehensive evaluation of tourism community resilience as a multiple attributes decision making process, we construct an effective multiple attributes group decision making (MAGDM) approach with assessments in the form of PDHF_UUBLS. Theoretical analyses verify the effectiveness of our constructed MAGDM approach and also show the approach avoids potential information distortion in comparison with other approaches. Overall, this paper provides effective and pertinent solutions, with both analytical framework and methodology, to the urgent task of comprehensive evaluation of tourism community resilience in DM2 agenda, thereby is of apparent significance in governance practice of CBT.
