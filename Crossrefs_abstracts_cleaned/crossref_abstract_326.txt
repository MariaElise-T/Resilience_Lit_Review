The aim of this research is to analyze the psychological resilience levels of football players playing in the U 16 development league within the Turkish football federation. Scanning model was used in the research. The sample of the research consists of 160 active players of eight teams in the men’s U16 development league of the Turkish football federation in the 2022-2023 season. As a data collection tool in the research, a personal information form stating the education status of the football players, the year of playing football, working with the same coach and monthly family income, as well as the “Psychological Hardiness Scale” (PHS) developed by Işık S was used to collect quantitative data. The resilience scale consists of three sub-dimensions: dedication, control and challenge. The normality distribution was tested by applying the kurtosis and skewness test to the data. T-test and ANOVA tests of the data were performed and multiple comparisons (Post-HocTukey) and correlation analysis were used. Statistical significance level was determined as 0.05. As a result of the research, the psychological resilience of the individuals who do sports at the elite level was significantly higher. In the education variable, psychological resilience was found to be positive in those with a high education level. A significant and low level positive relationship was found between the variables of playing football and working with the same coach. It is thought that this study can contribute to the fieldwork aimed at making suggestions to athletes with low resilience and increasing their resilience levels.
