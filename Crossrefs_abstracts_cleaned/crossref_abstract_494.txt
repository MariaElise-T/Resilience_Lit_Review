PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to present a multi‐year assistance plan aimed at promoting a disaster resilient and foreign‐aid‐independent community in rural Peru in the wake of the August 2007 Peru earthquake.Design/methodology/approachA collaborative effort among students and professionals from several fields including engineering, public health, business, planning, economics, and marketing is proposed to provide a holistic approach to mitigating effects of future disasters on a rural developing community.FindingsThis paper assesses community vulnerabilities exposed by the August 2007 Peru earthquake and provides conceptual solutions to mitigating effects of future disasters.Research limitations/implicationsBecause this is a student‐driven, volunteer‐based initiative, implementation of the discussed plan is sporadic in nature. As student leadership changes, solutions and implementation time frames discussed in this paper may be altered significantly.Practical implicationsThe student‐professional collaborative plan for enhancing disaster‐resilience discussed in this paper may be beneficial to educators who seek to extend the educational experience beyond the classroom. The holistic model of enhancing disaster‐resilience discussed in this paper may help relief organizations to better understand the issues facing small post‐disaster communities and subsequently help to develop more efficient recovery plans.Social implicationsThis project will have a great impact on improving the social and family life of the inhabitants of La Garita; the improvements in water supply will reduce health problems throughout the community.Originality/valueThis paper discusses a unique student‐professional collaborative approach to incorporating disaster‐resilience in the built environment. An educational component is incorporated into the framework of assistance in the interest of developing knowledgeable students and community members to provide a catalyst for future development projects in neighboring communities.
