 Despite the high percentage of adults living with anorexia nervosa (AN) over the life course, there is limited understanding of what it means to be living with AN in midlife when the majority of research has focused on adolescents and young adults. As such, clinical practice for individuals in midlife is informed by a severe and enduring AN (SE-AN) framework, which assumes that recovery is not necessarily feasible past young adulthood. This study used constructivist grounded theory methodology to understand the experiences of adults in midlife living with AN. In-depth analyses of 19 participant narratives in midlife show that individuals face barriers to seeking help or remaining in recovery; however, midlife can also act as a significant catalyst toward recovery. Subsequently, there is merit in revisiting the utility of the SE-AN framework in the context of life course theory and exploring resilience-informed approaches in supporting recovery from AN.
