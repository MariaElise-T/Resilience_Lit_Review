Significance
Activated na√Øve T cells acquire a memory state that improves their ability to respond to second antigen encounter. Whether activated T cells in tolerant settings can develop memory is less clear. Using a mouse model of cardiac transplantation, we show that alloreactive T cells failed to acquire phenotypic and functional characteristics of memory cells, but instead developed cell-intrinsic hyporesponsiveness. Acquiring the dysfunctional state depended on alloantigen persistence and duration of alloantigen exposure. Following infection-dependent abrogation of established tolerance, alloreactive T cells remained dysfunctional. The resilience of the hyporesponsive state, including the inability to differentiate into memory T cells, may explain why episodes of transplant rejection in the clinic do not preclude subsequent successful weaning from immunosuppressive drugs.
