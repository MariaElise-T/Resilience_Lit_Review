 Using a weight resilience framework, health habits of diet and physical activity, social support, and perceived stress were compared in women who lost weight (resilient) and those who did not lose or gained weight (nonresilient) during a weight-loss intervention. Participants were low-income postpartum women participating in a 13-week randomized treatment-control group intervention, with 20 of 50 classified as resilient in losing weight. Measures included the Postpartum Support Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and health habit items from the Self Care Inventory. Weight-loss resilient women showed significantly more frequent healthful dietary habits, such as eating a nutritious breakfast, and less frequent unhealthy habits, such as substituting junk food for meals, and less perceived stress than their nonresilient counterparts at both the midpoint and end of the study. Weight-loss resilient women also showed significantly more frequent physical activity habits at the end of the study. No social support differences were found.
