Background: Aging represents a time of significant challenges as well as opportunities for growth. Resilience helps older adults adjust to ongoing demands of aging. Little is known, however, about individual factors that bolster resilience. This study examines the potential contribution of psychological wellbeing in building resilience in older adults.Methods: A sample of 150 community-dwelling older adults was recruited from elder clubs in Alexandria, Egypt. Participant interviews included measures of resilience, psychological wellbeing, as well as measures of physical and psycho-social functioning.Results: Psychological wellbeing and resilience were positively and strongly correlated (r = .70, p < .001). Resilience was significantly associated with five dimensions of psychological wellbeing: mastery of environment (r = .54, p < .001), self-acceptance (r = .53, p < .001), personal growth, and purpose in life (both r = .49, p < .001), and autonomy (r = .36, p < .001). A weak, but significant association was found with the sixth dimension, positive relationship with others (r = .29, p < .001). Adjusting for potential confounding variables, psychological wellbeing remained significantly associated with resilience (β = .59, p < .001). Mastery of environment (β = .23, p < .01), autonomy (β = .20, p < .01), personal growth (β = .19, p < .01), and purpose in life (β = .18, p < .01), were independently influenced resilience among older adults.Conclusions: The findings highlight the adaptive function of psychological wellbeing in boosting resilience among older adults. Nursing strategies to optimize resilience and psychological wellbeing among older adults are delineated.
