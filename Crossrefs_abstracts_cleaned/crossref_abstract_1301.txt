 The goal of this study was to examine the effect of resiliency and family support on depression symptoms among 110 indigent adolescents attending a family planning clinic in a large urban city in southwestern USA. Findings suggested that several of the resiliency domains, on the Individual Protective Factors Index, as well as family support measured by the Family Support Scale, were associated with depression symptoms. Scores on the self-concept and positive outlook dimensions of the Personal Competence domain, the confidence and assertiveness dimensions of the Social Competence domain, and family support correlated with depression symptoms. The findings also suggested that 16.4% of the teens in this clinic would be classified as clinically depressed and as needing further evaluation. It seems reasonable to conclude that resilient adolescents may possess characteristics, beliefs, and supports which enable them to cope with life stressors more effectively and avoid depressive symptoms than those who are not as resilient. Given the prevalence and extent of depression among adolescents, it is important to develop interventions to foster attachment and enhance individual protective factors in primary prevention programs as such interventions may ameliorate the effects of high-risk environments.
