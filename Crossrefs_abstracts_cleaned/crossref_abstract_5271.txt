AbstractStain resistance, or more properly, appearance retention, is a complex phenomenon in resilient sheet flooring applications. The process can be complex, involving the plasticizer, the overall toughness (or abrasion resistance) of the wear layer, and the thermoplastic nature of plasticized PVC. This paper explores the plasticizer related portions of the stain resistance phenomenon. Data are presented to illustrate relationships between stain resistance and plasticizer structure, concentration, extraction resistance, volatility, and solubility parameter.
