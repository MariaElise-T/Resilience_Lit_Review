We contribute to the growing conversation on assets-based approaches to design in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a qualitative study of resilience. Our study is situated within a community health infrastructure in a rural county in southwest Kenya, where health organizations pay community health workers' salaries via digital payments, backdropped by ongoing issues with missing and delayed payments. Through the lens of intersectionality, we examine how community health workers of diverse backgrounds and contracted status respond to the mandated use of digital payment methods and long payment delays. We highlight how resilience in this context is situated in workers' intersecting socioeconomic and professional identities, which shape the assets and constraints that workers engage with in efforts to be resilient. We leverage our findings to discuss how assets-based approaches to design can be further operationalized and used to sustainably support resilience.
