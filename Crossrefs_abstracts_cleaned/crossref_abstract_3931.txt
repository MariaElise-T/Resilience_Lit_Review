INTRODUCTION: Throughout history, humans have always been prone to diverse experiences with different consequences. Consequently, a wide range of reactions is inevitable due to the different effects of these events on each person despite the same conditions. Therefore, it is indispensable to manage the physical and mental impacts of these events based on their magnitude. The present study aimed to assess the role of learning positive personality traits in the promotion of generational resilience and health.
METHODS: This applied research was conducted based on a comparative-causal design. The statistical population included 98 female high school students in Kerman who were selected by purposive sampling. The NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1985), the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg, 1997), and the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) (2003) were used to collect the needed data. Data analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test and regression analysis.
FINDINGS: Based on the obtained results, learning exerted a significant effect on the promotion of the studied variables. Awareness and training on these strategies would be of great help in the development and improvement of resilience and health, as well as purposeful management of emotions in emergencies in people of all ages, especially the youth.
CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the results of the present study, it can be concluded that learning and developing positive personality traits significantly reinforce them and lead to the enhancement of the resilience and health of the next generation.
