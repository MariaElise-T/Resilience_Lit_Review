This article focuses on the importance of a trans-disciplinary and participatory planning approach aiming at promoting a more resilient community. The COVID-19 outbreak is not just a health pandemic, but also a compound crisis in a globalized world, which emphasizes the need for, and urgency of, an ecological transition towards a new development model. This paper presents the outcomes of a research experience aimed at implementing a new development model inspired by integral sustainability for a transformative resilience of Basilicata region (Southern Italy). The research approach was implemented according to a participatory planning methodology to overcome the significant impacts of the pandemic and guide the transition towards real, sustainable development in all its dimensions (economic, social, environmental, and institutional). Community engagement in a research partnership allowed stakeholders to benefit from collective wisdom, creating more meaningful findings in preparing the regional community to face the challenges of the ecological transition. Scientific support of the research was fundamental in supporting political decision making in identifying strategic actions for a more sustainable and resilient Basilicata in this delicate historical moment of awareness, where the future will depend on todayâ€™s choices.
