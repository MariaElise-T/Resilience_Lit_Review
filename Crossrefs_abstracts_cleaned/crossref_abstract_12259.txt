Entrepreneurial failure exists objectively in the process of entrepreneurship, and the fear of entrepreneurship failure inhibits youth entrepreneurship activities to a certain extent. Thus, failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education is critical to cultivating youth entrepreneurial literacy. However, previous research on this topic has not provided a clear answer to how to improve youth entrepreneurial resilience. To explore the relationship between failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education and youth entrepreneurial resilience, using the questionnaire data of 399 youth recruited from China in October 2021 via the Credamo platform, the multiple regression analysis, and the Bootstrap method, we empirically analyzed the impact of failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education on youth entrepreneurial resilience, as well as the mediating effect of entrepreneurial cognition and the moderating effect of the fault-tolerant environment on the above relationship. The results show that failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education has a significant positive impact on youth entrepreneurial resilience. The two dimensions of willingness cognition and ability cognition in entrepreneurial cognition have a complete mediating effect on the impact of failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education on youth entrepreneurial resilience while the mediating effect of arrangements cognition is not significant. The fault-tolerant environment positively moderates the impact of failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial resilience, and its moderating effect is transmitted through the mediating effect of willingness cognition and ability cognition. A strong fault-tolerant environment enhances the impact of failure-learning-based entrepreneurship education on the formation of youth rational cognition, through the mediating effect of willing cognition and ability cognition, which further strengthens the positive impact on youth entrepreneurial resilience. The findings enrich the body of knowledge on entrepreneurship education and can improve youth entrepreneurial resilience.
