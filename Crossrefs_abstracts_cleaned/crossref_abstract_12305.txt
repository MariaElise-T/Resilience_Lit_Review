Given the increasing threat of disasters in the United States and elsewhere around the world, well‐tested assessment tools that operationalise specific protective factors associated with adaptation and resilience to such events are needed. Consequently, the authors proposed, developed, and validated the Disaster Adaptation and Resilience Scale (DARS) to measure five domains found to support adaptive responses in individuals exposed to disasters: physical resources; social resources; problem‐solving; distress regulation; and optimism. The development and validation processes of DARS occurred across two studies: the first comprised construct development, item generation, and expert review, whereas the second involved a full validation evaluation of the psychometric properties of the scale in a sample of adults exposed to a disaster in the US (N=625). The results revealed that DARS had psychometric properties that support its use among adults experiencing a disaster. A discussion is presented on how the scale can be employed in both research and practice.
