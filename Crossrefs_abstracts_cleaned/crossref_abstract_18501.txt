Nowadays, a challenge faced by all entrepreneurs is acquiring the ability to function in the reality of recurring economic crises, while at the same time obliging company management entities to verify the current methods of operation and their effectiveness in terms of crisis resilience. The purpose of this article is to present a created model of organisational culture characterised by a high degree of resilience to crisis, and then to demonstrate the possibility of its application in economic reality by entrepreneurs and stakeholders. The research process focuses on demonstrating the interdependencies between selected cultural features (dependent variables) and crisis resilience (dependent variable). As part of the model, the most important features of organisational culture have been distinguished, understood as the basic predictors of the resilience of organisational culture to crisis, such as: customer orientation, employee trust, transparency of activities, employee well-being, supporting managerial staff, creativity, employee loyalty, respect for others. The use of the model boils down not only to enabling verification of whether the current organisational culture of a given company can be considered resilient, but also indicates the direction of changes (desired culture) in the case of the willingness to transform in terms of shaping the culture of an organisation aiming at a culture of resilience.
