Abstract
The role of the sports medicine physician has been challenged in several ways during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially eroding a sense of well-being. Four universal human needs related to flourishing and a sense of life satisfaction are the framework we use to examine the effects of a pandemic on sports medicine clinicians. We offer two evidence-based practices to promote well-being and resilience within each of the four universal needs.
