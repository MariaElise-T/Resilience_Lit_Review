Abstract
By 2050, 140 million people will be living with dementia (WHO, 2021), most of whom will be cared for at home by family members, relatives, partners, friends, and neighbors, supplemented by help from paid caregivers. Because of their critical role in managing health and wellness for people living with dementia (PLWD), caregivers face unique stressors and challenges that can give rise to negative physical and mental health consequences. This symposium aims to strengthen our understanding about how to empower care partners to optimize health and wellness for themselves and PLWD in everyday living and during periods of health crisis. The first presentation characterizes behaviors care partners adopt that promote resilience in the face of dementia-related health crises (Zhou et al); the second describes facilitators and barriers to adoption of self-care behaviors that can promote resilience (Sadak et al). We then introduce a technology-enabled pilot intervention to strengthen care partnersâ€™ self-care behaviors (Ishado et al.) and a physical activity intervention to promote maintenance of function (Li et al.). We conclude with a panel discussion of cross-cutting implications of these approaches for future research, clinical care, and policy.
