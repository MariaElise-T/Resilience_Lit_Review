This study aims to examine the relationship between parent resilience, couple
   burnout, and misogyny of fathers with disabled children, while also
   investigating the mediating effect of parent resilience on the relationship
   between misogyny and couple burnout. This study included a sample of 120
   fathers whose children were attending a special education and rehabilitation
   center. Couple Burnout Scale Short Form, Misogyny Scale, Family Resilience
   Scale, and Personal Information Form were used as instruments in the study.
   The findings revealed a significant relationship between couple burnout and
   levels of misogyny, as well as a negative relationship between couple
   burnout and perception of parent resilience. Additionally, a negative
   relationship was observed between the level of misogyny and parent
   resilience. Importantly, parent resilience was found to mediate the
   relationship between level of misogyny and couple burnout, explaining 24.5%
   of the total variance. Based on these findings, it is recommended to
   prioritize psychological interventions that strengthen resilience of fathers
   with disabled children.
