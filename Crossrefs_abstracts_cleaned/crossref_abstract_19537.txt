This study aimed to explore how community disaster resilience can be enhanced via the utilization of ICT resources. Three social media applications were selected. Taking the 2021 Zhengzhou 7.20 rainstorm as an example, questionnaire responses were collected and analyzed, and a linear regression model was constructed to explore the impact of the relationships between responses. The findings showed that the use of WeChat, TikTok, and Weibo had positive effects on community disaster resilience. Specifically, the use of social media (WeChat, TikTok, and Weibo) by the general public during this rainstorm disaster was positively related to convenience and trust, creation and dissemination, emotion and communication, cooperation and collective action, and relief and release. We also analyzed the differences in the use of the three social media platforms during the rainstorm disaster and found that the number of people who used TikTok was the highest, but the variable scores for TikTok were not the highest. WeChat had the highest variable scores, and both the number of users and variable scores for Weibo were in the middle.
