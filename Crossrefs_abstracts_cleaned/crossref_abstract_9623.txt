PurposeThe main components of resiliency, including resilience capacities, resilience activities and resilience measures, are identified, extracted and redefined by designing their ontologies. The integrated model is developed by adapting the PDCA (plan, do, check and act) model to resilience management and implementing the developed concepts in the model.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses systems theory to define the main concepts discussed in the literature on resilience. This study then uses systems engineering theory and a resource-based view of the firm to develop an integrated framework to demonstrate how a resilient firm operates.FindingsThe revised terminologies and the integrated model address the current theoretical issues in the literature, and they also provide a reference model for practical implementation of resilience management at the firm level. Also, the integrated model addresses the role of innovation in resilience management.Originality/valueThe study examines the concept of resilience form a quality perspective and also examines how resilience and innovation are related.
