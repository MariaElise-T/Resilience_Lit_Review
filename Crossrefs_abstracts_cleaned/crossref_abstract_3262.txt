Abstract
Smart grid integrates the information and communication technologies with the physical grid. It can not only improve security and efficiency of traditional power grids, but also has advantages in promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. However, the existing smart grid systems suffer some security concerns such as privacy leakage and data tampering. In order to address these security issues, we propose a security framework for smart grid using Blockchain. It protects data privacy through cryptographic tools, and it applies Blockchain technologies to prevent data tampering. Compared with the existing smart grid systems, our proposed system enjoys better security and resilience.
