AbstractOver the last 15 years, particular attention has been paid to the protection and security of so-called critical infrastructures, including drinking water distribution networks (WDN). Infrastructure managers are seeking to ensure their security and improve their resilience. However, the question of the economic efficiency and of the economic benefits provided by such measures remains open. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this debate. It presents the results of a Choice Experiment survey aimed at estimating the benefits of measures to protect against a potential cyberattack in the territory of Eurométropole de Strasbourg in France. The aggregate benefits of two resilience programs are assessed. They help make ‘optimal’ and informed decisions from a cost–benefit perspective.
