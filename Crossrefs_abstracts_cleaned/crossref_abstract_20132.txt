BACKGROUND: The ability of adolescents to overcome the impact of domestic violence and reflect on the achievements is a form of resilience.
AIM: The study explored an in-depth description of the discovery process of the resilience ability in adolescent survivors of domestic violence.
METHODS: This qualitative research with a descriptive phenomenology approach interviewed seven adolescent survivors between the ages of 15 and 21. In-depth interviews were conducted, and demographic data were collected. Interviews were transcribed and coded thematically. Data was analyzed with the method of Colaizzi.
RESULTS: Four themes were derived from the interviews, including painful words from the close family member as a form of intimidation; the emotional response as imprinted feeling caused by the domestic violence; self-struggle starts from their own; and the happiness of the close family member as the purpose of life.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents responses to domestic violence cause mental health problems, however, they also manage to overcome problems, fulfill goals, and review their past and current life events to achieve life's purpose.
