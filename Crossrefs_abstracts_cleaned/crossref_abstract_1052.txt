Purpose
To meet the multidimensional needs of patients, health services are increasingly implementing complex programmes of care through partnerships between public, private and voluntary sector organisations. The purpose of this paper is to explore the implementation process of a complex, multi-innovative regional health and social care partnership to coordinate end-of-life care in the South East of England.


Design/methodology/approach
The study adopted a pragmatic, pluralist design using primarily qualitative methods including observations, interviews, focus group and document review. Implementation theory provided the research framework.


Findings
While progress was made towards greater collaboration in the provision of end-of-life care, regional coordination of care among the 13 partner organisations was not achieved as envisioned. Low engagement stemming from national health system changes delayed decision making and shifted partners’ priorities. Individual stakeholder interest and motivation carried the elements that were successful.


Practical implications
The external political and economic environment hindered the involvement of some of the partners and suggests that a concept of “project resiliency” is particularly important for complex, multi-organisational projects which are implemented over time and by multiple stakeholders from different sectors. Future research should look further at what contributes to project resiliency and whether it might be operationalized so that projects can develop resilient factors for success.


Originality/value
Project resiliency is a new concept that bridges a gap in understanding how time-limited multi-organisational projects function amid a changing environment.
