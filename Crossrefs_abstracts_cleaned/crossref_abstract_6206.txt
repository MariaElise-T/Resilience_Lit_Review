Depression and anxiety are prevalent, persistent, and difficult to treat industrialized world mental health problems that negatively modify an individual’s life perspective through brain function imbalances—notably, in the amygdala and hippocampus. Primarily treated with pharmaceuticals and psychotherapy, the number of individuals affected plus the intensity of their suffering continues to rise post-COVID-19. Decreasing depression and anxiety is a major societal objective. An approach is investigated that considers depression and anxiety consequences of the particular method people adopt in ordering their memories. It focuses on narrative development and the acceptance of different perspectives as uniquely necessary in creating safe protection from research burnout. The method encourages thoughtful reconsideration by participants of the negative assessments of their circumstances that can lead to depression and anxiety. The aim is to determine if the method of ordering developed is helpful in reducing burnout. This is considered through inspecting and comparing group members’ feedback form results, both pre- and post-COVID-19 restrictions. The method found useful to participants in reducing research burnout through developing hopeful resilience is comparable to authentic leadership. The conclusions offered encourage psychological and neurological research with respect to this method of promoting hopeful resilience for burnout to diminish depression and anxiety.
