With the impacts of tropical storms on Vietnam’s residences, the aim of the study is to produce a new framework for designing sustainable resilient houses in Vietnam’s coastal areas. This study was based on the community’s need to develop a set of guidelines for improving the stability of domestic buildings in storm-prone areas. It also addresses some unresolved issues including storm-proofing techniques and sustainable development in coastal dwellings. The main findings of this study were defined by the use of mixed-method approaches. These research methods involved observational surveys, questionnaires, interviews, case studies, and computer simulations. Particularly, the case studies were simulated by the use of computational fluid dynamics to mimic the storm impacts on existing buildings. These concentrated on the solutions, techniques, benefits, and challenges of sustainable resilience in coastal residences. The results are presented by a framework for designing a sustainable resilient house and a prototype was also tested. Both the framework and the prototype can satisfy the community demands by making energy-efficient buildings and effective wind mitigation guiding other research about developing sustainable and resilient houses in the future.
