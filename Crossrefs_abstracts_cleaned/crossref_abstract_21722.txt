BackgroundMixed results in the predictive ability of traditional biomarkers to determine cognitive functioning and changes in older adults have led to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment plans to address mild cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. To address this critical gap, the primary goal of the current study is to investigate whether a digital neuro signature (DNS-br) biomarker predicted global cognitive functioning and change over time relative among cognitively impaired and cognitive healthy older adults. The secondary goal is to compare the effect size of the DNS-br biomarker on global cognitive functioning compared to traditional imaging and genomic biomarkers. The tertiary goal is to investigate which demographic and clinical factors predicted DNS-br in cognitively impaired and cognitively healthy older adults.MethodsWe conducted two experiments (Study A and Study B) to assess DNS for brain resilience (DNS-br) against the established FDG-PET brain imaging signature for brain resilience, based on a 10 min digital cognitive assessment tool. Study A was a semi-naturalistic observational study that included 29 participants, age 65+, with mild to moderate mild cognitive impairment and AD diagnosis. Study B was also a semi-naturalistic observational multicenter study which included 496 participants (213 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 283 cognitively healthy controls (HC), a total of 525 participantsâ€”cognitively healthy (n = 283) or diagnosed with MCI (n = 213) or AD (n = 29).ResultsDNS-br total score and majority of the 11 DNS-br neurocognitive subdomain scores were significantly associated with FDG-PET resilience signature, PIB ratio, cerebral gray matter and white matter volume after adjusting for multiple testing. DNS-br total score predicts cognitive impairment for the 80+ individuals in the Altoida large cohort study. We identified a significant interaction between the DNS-br total score and time, indicating that participants with higher DNS-br total score or FDG-PET in the resilience signature would show less cognitive decline over time.ConclusionOur findings highlight that a digital biomarker predicted cognitive functioning and change, which established biomarkers are unable to reliably do. Our findings also offer possible etiologies of MCI and AD, where education did not protect against cognitive decline.
