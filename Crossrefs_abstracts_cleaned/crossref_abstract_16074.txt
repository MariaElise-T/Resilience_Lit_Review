Resilience among the medical interns is essential and is protective against the state of burnout. However, it is not thoroughly investigated among medical interns. Is there any behavioural and modifiable factors influencing resilience? The objective of this study is to determine the level of resilience among medical interns in Malaysia and its associated factors. This nationwide cross-sectional study recruited medical interns from 17 randomly selected Malaysian hospitals accredited for medical intern training. All medical interns who reported to the selected hospitals from January to April 2020 were invited to answer an online questionnaire. The questionnaire incorporated Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) for resilience, USMEQ-i to measure emotional quotient, Brief-Cope to assess coping styles, Preparedness for Hospital Practice Questionnaire (PHPQ test) to assess internship preparedness and questions related to sociodemographic, undergraduate training and interest to become a doctor.<strong> </strong>524 from 870 medical interns (60.2%) responded. Mean resilience score was 28.6 (SD = 6.33). Significant factors associated with resilience include active involvement in sports (p = 0.002), high EQ (p&lt;0.001), interest to become a doctor (p&lt;0.001), coping using humour (p&lt;0.001), less coping by venting (p&lt;0.001) and no failures in any clinical posting (p = 0.012). The regression model was substantiated by adjusted R2 of 62.8%.Â Factors affecting resilience among medical interns include modifiable factors such as coping styles and involvement in sports. The findings could guide targeted intervention to promote during medical schools or internship preparation programmes to increase resilience among medical interns.
