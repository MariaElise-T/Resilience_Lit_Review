The  Covid  period  has  made  issues  of  solidarity  and  isolation  particularly  important  in  society  today.  Adversity  tends  to  cause  society  to  drift  towards  despair, the survival of the fittest and development that leave many behind. We have seen enough of this with many crises that African societies have confronted including violence, crime, governance crises, terrorism and health calamities. Yet, these crises have already generated interest in ways of building resilience through solidarity and cooperation.
