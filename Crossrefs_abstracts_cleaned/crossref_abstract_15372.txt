 Abstract. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has penetrated almost all countries and has affected people in many areas. The COVID-19 pandemic also has affected the mental health of the community. Aims: The purpose of this study is to investigate the individuals’ perceptions of subjective well-being (SWB) and resilience (R) during the pandemic. Method: A total of 643 people, 351 women and 292 men, who are not diagnosed with COVID-19, have voluntarily participated in the study. The data were collected online due to social restrictions. Also, their pre-pandemic SWB and R levels were evaluated based on their statements taken during the pandemic since the pandemic was not foreseen at this time. Results: A significant decrease was observed in participants’ SWB and R levels during the pandemic. Besides, significant differences were observed in R levels according to gender and age; on the other hand, no difference was observed according to the participants’ residence type, city type, education level, and job status. Regarding SWB level, significant differences were observed according to gender, age, and job status; no difference was observed according to residence type, city type, and education level. Limitations: Participants’ subjective well-being and resilience data could not be collected before the pandemic due to the unpredictable and fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. When individuals compare the current pandemic period with their past (before the pandemic), they may perceive their resilience and subjective well-being levels as decreased. Conclusion: The pandemic affects the subjective well-being and resilience of individuals negatively.
