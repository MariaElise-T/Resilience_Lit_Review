Adversity in life is rarely considered positive. Adverse events can increase stress levels and decrease psychological well-being. However, experience of overcoming hardship can be the start of developing psychological resilience in life. Resilience is known to help regulate negative emotions and provides protection to oneâ€™s psychological well-being. The current study focused on contributing to present literature by further investigating the role of resilience on mitigating the negative impact of stress on psychological well-being. In the current study, resilience is expected to positively influence the relationship between perceived stress and psychological well-being by negating the direct negative effect of stress on psychological well-being. Participants in the study included adults between 25- and 71-years-old in the U.S. recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The survey included questions addressing demographic information, perceived stress, resilience, and psychological well-being. A mediation analysis was used to analyze the hypotheses. Results showed a partial mediation found between perceived stress and psychological well-being and this relation suggests that resilience plays a small role in negating the negative effects caused by stress.
