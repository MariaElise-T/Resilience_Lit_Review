 The present study examined the associations of academic resilience and achievement goals with test anxiety, and the moderating role of achievement goals in the relation between academic resilience and test anxiety among 1632 secondary one students from eight secondary schools in Singapore. Results showed that students who reported lower levels of academic resilience also reported higher levels of cognitive test anxiety, and those who reported higher levels of avoidance-goal endorsement reported higher levels of cognitive test anxiety. Importantly, the relationship between academic resilience and test anxiety was moderated by avoidance-based goals endorsement level. Specifically, this relationship was stronger for those who endorsed higher levels of avoidance-based goals. Approach-based achievement goals did not significantly interact with academic resilience to influence test anxiety. Implications of the findings are discussed.
