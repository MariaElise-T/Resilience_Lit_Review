This work aimed to propose an instrument to represent the sensitivity, fragility, adaptability and the risk of pollution of water resources, by measuring and identifying indexes and indicators that assign characteristics to a certain area (basin). This research consists of three steps: the first was based on the recollection of data needed to execute this proposal. The second, we applied the used indexes and indicators into this research.  The third sought to determine, identify and understand the impacts produced, the fragility generated to ecosystems due to pollution levels found. Through this methodological proposal, we sought to know the changes of the resistance potential, the negative impact on aquatic ecosystems and the ease in which they can be self-Debug- water resources. It was indicated that the resilience index of surface water resources (IR), in which he presented are examples applied in two watersheds, highlighting that this index can be applied at any scale.
