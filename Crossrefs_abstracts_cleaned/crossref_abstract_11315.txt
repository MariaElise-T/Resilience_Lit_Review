Although research on human resource management practices (HRMPs) has been ongoing for many years, studies have actually paid little attention to HRMPs and their contribution to the emotional side of the bottom line or commitment to the external environment, particularly the serial mediation of HRMPs. Hence, to fill this research void, this study extends social exchange theory, broaden-and-build theory and the conservation of resources (COR) theory in the context of green hospitality by proposing a novel conceptual model to test the mediating effects of resilience and commitment between HRMPs (training, empowerment, and rewards) and service providersâ€™ environmental commitment. A quantitative study was performed involving 557 participants at green hotels. The findings show that the components of HRMPs (training, rewards, and empowerment) were found to be crucial tools in encouraging service providers to engage in environmental tasks while green training, empowerment and reward systems can unlock environmental commitment (EEC) for the setting. In addition, environmental commitment increased by the contribution of two mediators, resilience and engagement; and interestingly, rewards did not contribute to the environmental resilience of service providers, while all three HRMPs had a positive influence on work engagement of service providers in the research context.
