Research on health disparities among Hispanic/Latino populations has begun to look at resiliency as a key component to the health risk profile of Hispanics. However, there are still gaps in the research about the specific factors. This study sought to examine the relationship between factors in 4 primary domains—behavioral, psychological, social, and cultural—and resilience in Hispanic young adults. We used data from Project RED, which included 1503 Hispanic young adults. Results indicate that cultural factors (acculturation and cultural identity), psychological factors (depression, stress, and coping), and social connectedness are important determinants of resilience among Hispanic young adults.
