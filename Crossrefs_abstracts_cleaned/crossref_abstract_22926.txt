Introduction. The relevance of the problem stems from the importance of studying the psychological determinants of people’s attitudes to hazards. A number of factors among them that can act as safety resources are of special importance. These factors include psychological capital and resilience. The purpose of the study was to identify the relationship between psychological capital, resilience and people’s attitudes to hazards, as exemplified by students. Materials and methods. The following was used as diagnostic tools: original questionnaires aimed to assess sensitivity to threats and substantiate the choice of response methods in hazardous situations, the Russian author-modified version of F. Lutans, K. Joseph and B. Avolio questionnaire towards identifying psychological capital, a brief version of the resilience questionnaire adapted by M.V. Alfimova and V.E. Golimbet. The study encompassed 340 students from a number of higher educational establishments of Moscow, Ivanovo, Cherepovets (Russian Federation); women – 268 (78.82%), men – 72 (21.18%), average age 19.8 years old (SD=1.88). Results. It was found that sensitivity to threats and the choice of adequate response methods are positively correlated with psychological capital (r=0.38, p≤0.01 and r=0.43, p≤0.01) and resilience (r=0.31, p≤0.01 and r=0.33, p≤0.01). Conversely, exaggeration of hazards proved to be negatively correlated to psychological capital (r=-0.29, p≤0.01) and resilience (r=-0.21, p≤0.01); meanwhile downplaying (ignoring) threats was negatively correlated with hope (r=-0.25, p≤0.01), activity involvement (r=-0.16, p≤0.01) and positively correlated with risk acceptance (r=0.12, p≤0.05). Conclusion. The obtained results can be used in organising safety activities and in working with students towards development of adequate style of handling hazards.
