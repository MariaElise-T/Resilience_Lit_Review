The health of African Americans has been largely described in terms of deficits, disease and death. Little attention has been histori­cally given to the fact that African Americans as a population show the sustained ability to survive an evolving array of social, eco­nomic and environmental adversities that date back to more than a century before the founding of the United States. While these inequities have indeed taken (and continue to take) a devastating toll, there is also wide heterogeneity in outcomes, suggesting the existence of substantial individual and col­lective resilience among African Americans.This Perspective aims to stimulate discus­sion and research that explores resilience in a population in which “overcoming” and “bouncing back” from adversities (ranging from minor incidents to legally ordained, chronic and horrific oppression) has been a requirement for survival. Rigorous scientific exploration of Black resilience may yield important insights into the phenomenon of human resilience that transcend race. Ethn Dis. 2020;30(2):365-368; doi:10.18865/ ed.30.2.365
