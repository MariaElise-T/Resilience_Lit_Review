DNA methylation in insects is integral to cellular differentiation, development, gene regulation, genome integrity, and phenotypic plasticity. However, its evolutionary potential and involvement in facilitating rapid adaptations in insects are enigmatic. Moreover, our understanding of these mechanisms is limited to a few insect species, of which none are pests of crops. Hence, we studied methylation patterns in the brown planthopper (BPH), a major rice pest, under pesticide and nutritional stress, across its life stages. Moreover, as the inheritance of epigenetic changes is fundamentally essential for acclimation, adaptability, and evolution, we determined the heritability and persistence of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH across generations. Our results revealed that DNA methylation pattern(s) in BPH varies/vary with environmental cues and is/are insect life-stage specific. Further, our findings provide novel insights into the heritability of stress-induced methylation marks in BPH. However, it was observed that, though heritable, these marks eventually fade in the absence of the stressors, thereby suggesting the existence of fitness cost(s) associated with the maintenance of the stressed epigenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate how 5-azacytidine-mediated disruption of BPH methylome influences expression levels of stress-responsive genes and, thereby, highlight demethylation/methylation as a phenomenon underlying stress resilience of BPH.
