Building resilience is a great necessity, especially for adolescents who have spent most of their time at home with their families and have also had to cope with the pandemic situation. Resilience ensures that they persevere, adapt, and rise to the occasion when dealing with difficult circumstances. This study aims to empirically test the role of secure attachment and mindfulness in adolescent resilience in the New Normal era. The subjects were 220 adolescents, students at junior high school in the city of Semarang, selected using the convenience sampling technique. The study is a correlational quantitative research using regression analysis. The instrument employed involved scales, namely the Secure Attachment Scale, the Mindfulness Scale, and the Resilience Scale. The results show a significant and positive relationship between secure attachment and mindfulness in relation to adolescentsâ€™ resilience in the New Normal. The results, therefore, indicate that families should emphasize the development of psychological skills in adolescents, especially resilience, across the country.
