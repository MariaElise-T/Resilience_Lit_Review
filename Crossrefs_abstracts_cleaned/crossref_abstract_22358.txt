This study was attempted to identify the perceived stress, resilience, attitude toward mental illness, and the degree of mental health of nursing students and their relationship, as well as the factors affecting mental health. The subjects were 200 nursing students from a university located in D City who participated from March 23 to April 10, 2023, and the collected data were analyzed by SPSS/Win 23.0. As a result of the study, the degree of mental health of nursing students was negatively correlated with perceived stress, and resilience and attitude toward mental illness were positively correlated. Perceived stress and resilience were the factors affecting the mental health of nursing students, and resilience was found to have the greatest impact on the mental health of nursing students, and explanatory power was 56.8% (F=88.132, p<.001). Based on the results of this study, it is necessary to develop and apply a mental health management program for nursing students and follow-up studies on various factors affecting the mental health of nursing students.
