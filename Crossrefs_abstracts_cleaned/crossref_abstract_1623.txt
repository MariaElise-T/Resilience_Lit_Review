In recent times the concepts of smart city, compact city, resilient city, resilient design, sustainable design and sustainable city have crept into city/ environmental planning/design discourse and practice. While the meanings are not clearly understood especially as they apply to cities of a developing country like Nigeria, there seems to be a very thin divide between them. This study appraised these terms with respect to their intrinsic design principles in a bid to make the professionals and the stakeholders in our built environment aware of their implicit need for application to Nigerian cities. The methodology relied on literature review of the terms and concepts. The study drew examples from the developed world to establish that the definitions of these concepts and terms are overlapping and complimentary. The concepts are also found to be applicable to Nigerian cities in the identified circumstances therein. Although some frameworks were identified, no cook-book or methodological pathways for their application to cities generally was encountered in the literature surveyed. It is hoped that the study has exposed their implications for current and future urban planning and design paradigms in Nigeria.
