This paper outlines the process of formalizing Priority Action 4, “Build Back Better,” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. We propose this formalization by introducing the background and existing framework of recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction, a case-study of Post-War Japan, and the outcome of discussions implemented in the Global Forum on Science and Technology for Disaster Resilience 2017 held at the Science Council of Japan in Tokyo on November 23–25, 2017. This paper also summarizes the results of discussions regarding further development of Priority Action 4.
