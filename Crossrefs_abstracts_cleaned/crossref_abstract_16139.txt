AbstractThe building group is the basis for the maintenance and operation of the city. The rapid recovery of community building group (CBG) can effectively reduce economic losses caused by earthquakes. There is service function interdependence among the buildings, and the impact of this interdependence on the postdisaster recovery of CBG is not clear. In order to improve the postdisaster recovery efficiency of CBG and explore the impact of service function dependence among buildings on postdisaster recovery, this paper integrates the recovery time (RT) and functionality loss (FL) of individual buildings and proposes two multi‐objective optimization recovery models suitable for CBG: the postearthquake recovery optimization model of CBG and the postearthquake recovery optimization model of CBG considering the service function interdependence among buildings. In these models, building RT, building FL, CBG resilience, and building recovery resources are considered, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm‐Ⅱ is used to solve the models to obtain the optimal restoration scheduling of CBG. At the same time, through a case, this paper analyzes the impact of the interdependence of service function among buildings and recovery resources on the recovery scheduling and resilience of CBG. This method can provide a basis for pre‐earthquake disaster risk reduction planning and significantly improves the postdisaster recovery efficiency of CBG.
