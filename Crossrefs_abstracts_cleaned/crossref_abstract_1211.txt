The increasing prevalence and impact of trauma, such as adverse childhood experiences, race-based trauma, and a global pandemic, highlight the critical need for a flexible multisystemic framework of resilience. This manuscript outlines the universality of trauma and resilience and also provides a description of the gaps in existing resilience frameworks that led to the development of a flexible multisystemic resilience framework entitled the ARCCH Model of Resilience. Attachment, Regulation, Competence, Culture, and Health are elements of personal and cultural identities, families, communities, and systems that can be used to evaluate strengths, identify areas that need support, and provide steps for culturally responsive and ecologically valid interventions. A multisystemic application of ARCCH is provided.
