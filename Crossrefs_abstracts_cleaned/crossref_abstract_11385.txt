This paper is mainly to study the tensile and resilience performance in a knitted plain Modal fabric by uniaxial and biaxial experimental. The results indicated that under uniaxial tensile, the breaking strength along warp direction of the knitted plain Modal fabric was higher about 75% than the strength in weft, while weft elongation was higher about 60% than in warp. The strength-strain curves under uniaxial tensile and biaxial tensile of the fabric were made up of approximately three stages: a linear stage and two nonlinear stages. A set of parameters and a serial mathematical fitting model functions of the strength-strain curves were obtained by experimentally. It could be predicted stress and strain of knitted fabrics under some given certain elongation or load to meet certain clothing pressure comfort for underwear fabrics or garment.
