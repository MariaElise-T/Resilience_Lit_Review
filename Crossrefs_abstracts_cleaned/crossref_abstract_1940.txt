Resilient mounts are used in shipboard isolation systems to reduce the structureborne noise transmitted by the hull from machinery. The transfer impedances of resilient mounts are needed to determine the transmitted noise. The only resilient mount data generally available are the load deflection curves and low-frequency dynamic stiffness. That data is not adequate for predicting the transmitted structureborne noise for frequencies above a few hundred hertz. This study deals with the experimental determination of the transfer impedances for Navy and commercial types of resilient mounts. A mount test fixture was designed and constructed. Four types of Navy mounts were tested (6E900, 6E2000, 5B5000H and 5M10000H) with static loads ranging from 50% to 125% of rated loads. Several types of commercial mounts and isolators (Aeroflex, Barry, Firestone, and Peabody Noise Control) were also tested. An impact hammer was used for the vibration source. Force and acceleration data were recorded on the input and output sides of the mount under test. Test data were recorded in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 25 KHz. The results were compared with test results from other sources when available.
