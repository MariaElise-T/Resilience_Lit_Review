The overall purpose of this study is to explore and examine whether high-performance work systems (HPWS) can impact thriving at work and job burnout via resilience at work among nurses in Chinese public hospitals. Specifically, it draws on social exchange theory to conceptualize a positive relationship between HPWS and resilience at work. Then, based on a socially embedded model of thriving at work and knowledge about job burnout in the literature, it further proposes the differentiated mediation roles of resilience at work in the relationship of HPWS to thriving at work and job burnout. A time-lagged survey involving three rounds of data collection with self-reported online questionnaires was employed. A total of 160 nurses from 20 public hospitals in China were invited to participate in the research. Finally, a sample of 845 responses was obtained. The response rate was 52.8%. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. It was found that HPWS (time 1) positively impacted resilience at work (time 2). The results also demonstrated that HPWS (time1) enhanced thriving at work (time 3) and reduced job burnout (time 3) via developing resilience at work (time 2). To conclude, being resilient in the workplace is crucial for nurses to enhance thriving at work, and inhabit job burnout among nurses. HPWS is a valid management tool that can be used to cultivate a nurseâ€™s resilience at work, which further reduces job burnout and enhance thriving at work.
