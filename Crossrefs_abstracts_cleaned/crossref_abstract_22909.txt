The formation mechanism of cross-city transportation network resilience occupies an important position in cross-city transportation network resilience management. This study analyzes the constituent elements of the cross-city transportation network and their interrelationships, and the connotation of cross-city transportation network resilience is defined from the general meaning of system resilience. Combining with the connotation of cross-city transportation network resilience, the specific formation process of cross-city transportation network resilience is analyzed and summarized from three stages, including resisting disturbance, absorbing disturbance, and function recovery. Taking cross-city transportation network nodes and systems as specific objects, the static and dynamic formation path of cross-city transportation network resilience is condensed. Based on the standard linear solid model, a theoretical model is constructed and solved for revealing the formation mechanism of cross-city transportation network resilience. Finally, the theoretical model of cross-city transportation network resilience proposed in this study is used for analyzing the China railway network resilience.
