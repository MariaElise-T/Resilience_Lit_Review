PurposeFollowing a contingent resource-based view (CRBV) perspective, this paper aims to explore the operating context in which supply chain resilience (SCRE) is likely to enhance the supply chain performance (SCP) of organizations. More specifically, the authors developed the ‘Supply Chain Resilience’ model wherein we considered two important exogenous context variables (supply chain relational practices [SCRPs] and network complexities [NCs]) and studied their moderating roles on the relationship between SCRE and SCP. The authors also investigated the conditional effect of SCRE on SCP at different levels of SCRPs and NCs.Design/methodology/approachThis study used both qualitative and quantitative approaches. For the qualitative approach, a field study was undertaken, while the quantitative study was conducted via the use of a survey questionnaire of 274 apparel manufacturers and their suppliers in Bangladesh. The authors applied Hayes PROCESS enabled multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling to statistically test the proposed research models.FindingsThe research findings revealed that SCRP and NC individually moderated the link between SCRE and SCP. The link between SCRE and SCP was strengthened via the interaction effect of SCRP and NC, even if the NC value was high.Practical implicationsThe findings will assist supply chain managers in managing supply chain performance during uncertainties by strengthening resilience capability at different levels of NCs and SCRPs.Originality/valueDrawing on CRBV, the authors studied how the conditional effects of exogenous variables (SCRP and NC) moderated the relationship between SCRE and SCP in both two- and three-way interactions, which is a novel approach in the SCRE literature and also extends the theoretical perspective of CRBV.
