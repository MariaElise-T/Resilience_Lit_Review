Foxtail millet is one among the earliest cultivated and climate-resilient crop species with an immense nutritional profile. They are adapted to grow under a wide range of harsh environmental conditions ranging from high temperature to drought and salinity. It does not demand proper irrigation, artificial soil nutrients or insecticide. But they are incredible with their nutritional contents; almost five to ten times more nutritionally richer than the extensively consumed rice or wheat in terms of micronutrients, fibres and vitamins. It is a staple food crop in the various regions of Asia and Africa. The current COVID-19 pandemic and forthcoming environmental challenges may lead to the instability of agriculture and food security. Therefore, foxtail millet may serve an emissary crop to meet the demand of food supply for humans and cattle as well as rejuvenate other economically important crops against environmental constraints through biotechnological approaches.
