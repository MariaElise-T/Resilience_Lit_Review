Abstract
In view of the problem that in the training of football athletes, coaches pay attention to their football skills and physical quality and ignore their psychological quality training, which leads to poor psychological quality of the athletes, this paper studies the effect of compound training on improving the psychological resilience of football athletes in depth. On the one hand, this paper modeled human lower-limb motion chain. First of all, the explosive power of lower limbs of football athletes was evaluated, and the maximum value of the product was obtained in the power-velocity curve, which aims to further increase the velocity and power of movements. Then, the human multi-rigid body model of lower limbs was established, and the motion chain curve planning of zero-point moment and center of gravity was carried out, which transforms the motion modeling problem of human lower-limb motion chain into the basic variable set problem of human lower-limb motion state. Finally, through the basic variables planning of human lower-limb motion state, the accurate modeling of human lower-limb motion chain was obtained. On the other hand, this paper analyzed and summarized the theory that compound training is capable of improving psychological resilience of football athletes, sorted out and integrated the influencing factors of psychological resilience, and on this basis conducted research and put forward a new development direction of psychological resilience. The experimental results show that the PEM value of goal focus and emotion control is 0.82, and the PEM value of positive cognition is 0.73, indicating that athletes’ performance in positive cognition has been significantly improved. Therefore, it is concluded that psychological resilience can reduce athletes’ athletic burnout, stimulate athletes’ athletic motivation, and enable athletes to take a more positive and optimistic attitude toward training and competition, so as to achieve better athletic performance.
