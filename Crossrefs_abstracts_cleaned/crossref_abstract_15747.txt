Water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise and other effects of climate change, especially in low coastal regions such as south Florida. Alternative water and wastewater recovery programs that work now may not be applicable in 100 years. Florida Atlantic University evaluated options that the water utility in the coastal community of the city of Pompano Beach, Fla., could apply to improve resilience to climate change effects. Immediate issues were that groundwater level rise resulting from sea level rise would create significant challenges to the utility's plans for new wells, aquifer recharge, hydrodynamic barrier programs, and reclaimed water programs. A number of potential solutions lie beyond the utility's control, and regional solutions will be needed to resolve long‐term effects. A rethinking of long‐term water management should include adaptation programs that consist of vulnerability analysis, infrastructure assessment, short‐ and long‐term applicability of current practices when considering effects of climate change, development of a toolbox of potential technical and management solutions, and a planning framework for increasing resilience and sustainability using adaptive management to deal with uncertainties.
