ABSTRACT

Aim
The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of denture cleansers on resiliency of soft liner.


Materials and methods
Two soft liners (Molloplast-B and Refit) and two denture cleansers (Clinsodent and Fittydent) were taken. Cylindrical aluminum dies were constructed of 12 mm length and 8 mm diameter at the ratio of 1.5:1. The samples are tested with Hounsfield tensometer.


Observation and results
Effect of both the denture cleansers on the lining materials was shown in the form of Graphs 1 and 2. The elastic recovery of Molloplast B in dry, Fittydent and Clinsodent is comparatively more than refit, but in control group the elastic recovery of both the material is almost equal.


Conclusion
Heat processed soft liners recover faster/better in a shorter time interval when compared to self-processed liners which takes longer time for the recovery. This time period is very important as the cushioning effect of the soft liner require an elastic recovery between the masticatory strokes.


Clinical implications
Greater the softness and better the elastic recovery of the denture soft liner, more effective would be its performance clinically. Silicon based material, such as Molloplast-B, rebounds quickly and would seem preferable to a material that is acrylic based. It is possible that, if the response is too slow or the elastic recovery is less, there may only be a partial recovery of the lining between the masticatory strokes. Progressive thinning of the lining materials might then occur resulting in a reduced cushioning effect.
