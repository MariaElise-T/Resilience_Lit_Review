Resilience is the capacity to anticipate and plan for disturbances, resist damages and/or absorb impacts, rapidly recover afterwards, and adapt to stressors, changing conditions and constraints. Coastal hazards in the US, including the compounding of surge, rainfall, waves, climate change, and clustered events, create significate challenges to designing and maintaining resilient coastal systems. The range of design solutions include natural and nature-based, non-structural, and structural measures together with flexible adaptation strategies. Moving forward, the community requires: robust physical process and probabilistic modeling methods, advanced sensing techniques, broad collaboration, and a commitment to innovation and adaption.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/fQvAXEj0Ar0
