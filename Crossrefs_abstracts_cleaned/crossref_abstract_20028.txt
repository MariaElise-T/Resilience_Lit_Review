 Climate change and the need for weather-resilient infrastructure is introducing new safety, performance and financial challenges and opportunities to regulators and those that are regulated. As the safety and economic regulator for railways in Great Britain, the Office of Rail and Road is required to protect the interests of rail users and funders by improving the safety, value and performance of railways, today and in the future. The approach to and understanding of climate change and weather resilience is developing; however, there is an expectation of infrastructure managers to make their asset types more resilient to climate change. This paper explores potential gaps in industry knowledge, what is ‘good’ practice, how to assess safety and efficiency and how to measure value. Understanding these questions will inform an approach. Regulatory experience suggests that a spectrum of practice exists, from more resilient business as usual to technology adoption. Regional variation has implications for funding, accountability and stakeholders. In this paper, the authors have collected examples across the spectrum; these have been grouped into four themes and an accessible model created to optimise decision making. The authors conclude that proactive value-driven approaches to weather resilience are possible but will require organisational adaptability and recognition that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.
