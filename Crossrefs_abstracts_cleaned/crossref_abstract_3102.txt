 This study explores hospice administratorsâ€™ perceptions of the characteristics of resilient hospice workers. This qualitative phenomenological study included ten participants from five hospice organizations in rural and urban Southwest Missouri communities. All participants were current hospice administrators. Administrators identified six characteristics of resilient hospice workers. These characteristics included (a) relationship building with clients, (b) having a supportive team, (c) ongoing education, (d) positivity, (e) strong boundaries, and (f) the importance of spirituality. Authors suggest identifying and encouraging these characteristics in hospice workers may lead to less employee turnover, healthier employees, and a better work environment.
