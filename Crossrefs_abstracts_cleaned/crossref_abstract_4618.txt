The present research study focuses to examine the significance of difference between the mean scores of independent variables on prospective teacher’s resilience. The objectives of the study were; (i) to study the significance of difference of mean scores of following independent variables on prospective teacher’s resilience: (a) Gender; (b) Caste (c) Types of College and (d) Discipline. Null hypotheses were framed. Data were collected from 244 prospective teachers by incidental sampling technique from four teacher education colleges i.e. B.Ed. colleges of Mehsana district using self-constructed Resilience Scale.  Mean, S.D. and t-value were employed for data calculation and analysis. The findings of the present research study indicated no statistically significant difference between the mean scores of subsets of Gender, Caste, and Types of College. But, the Prospective Teachers of Commerce were found to be significantly higher at .01 level of significance than Prospective Teachers of Arts and Prospective Teachers of Science on mean scores (3.116≥ 2.58) of Resilience Scale.
