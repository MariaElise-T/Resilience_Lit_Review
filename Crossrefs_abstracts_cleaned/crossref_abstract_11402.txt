Research about the predictors of resilience in the inmate population needs further explorations. This study examines the predictors of resilience in male inmates from Padua prison, before and after a 9-session neuropsychopedagogical intervention, entitled Envisioning the Future (EF), which took part in remote during Covid-19 pandemic. Using two linear regression models, a change in the factors determining inmates' resilience was found from before to after the intervention. In the pre-course group (n = 24), only low avoidance emerged as a statistically significant predictor of the level of resilience. In the post-course group (n = 24) low avoidance, flexibility, high levels of social support, and self-efficacy in managing positive emotions emerged as significant predictors of inmates' resilience. The results show that the constellation of factors predicting resilience in prisoners can be enriched by participating to neuropsychopedagogical interventions like EF, that increases individuals' resources in a challenging context such as prison.
