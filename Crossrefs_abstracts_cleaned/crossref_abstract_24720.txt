The lack of adequate knowledge sharing and knowledge creation about disasters and climate change has been identified as a reason behind the unsatisfactory performance of climate-adaptation and disaster-management practices. This study aimed to identify the critical factors in knowledge creation in order to improve community resilience and propose a conceptual model. The main objectives of this study were to i) identify the key factors supporting the creation of knowledge, ii) identify the key factors promoting community resilience, and iii) develop a conceptual model to improve community resilience based on knowledge creation. This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in four coastal subdistricts in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. A total of 300 samples were obtained from among respondents living in the coastal area using a purposive random sampling technique. The paper presents a literature review exploring theories and concepts concerning the factors supporting knowledge creation as a way to increase community resilience. A conceptual framework is then generated based on the results of field surveys and prior studies. The knowledge-level survey results indicate a need to develop a community resilience framework based on Knowledge Creation Theory as the foundation for decision making and ensure the transmission of knowledge across generations. This study proposes a conceptual model of Knowledge Creation for Community Resilience (KCCR).
