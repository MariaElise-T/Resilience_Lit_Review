Abstract
Over the last two decades, terms connected with efficient functioning emerged within the education paradigm. The scientific research is aimed at investigating the education community’s resilience as a predictor of efficient educational system. Resilience may be defined as the power or ability to recover readily from adversity, stresses or the like to the original form or elasticity. The study included short theoretical analysis of different schools of thought, self-assessment of students and teachers abilities to discern and identify the constructs of resilience phenomenon. The survey sample included about 150 participants. The set of questionnaires the respondents were asked to complete consisted of three sections, including assessment, discerning the resilient behaviour and respondents’ personal information. The empirical study findings included the description of the sample in terms of resilience level; correlation analysis identifying the relationships between factors stated and resilience subscales as well as among all variables; factor analysis reducing the number of variables and extracting principal factors associated with resilience, personal data. Comparison of the results of the three groups identified differences not only on the level of resilience, but also on the characteristics the research project participants endued with teachers and students.
