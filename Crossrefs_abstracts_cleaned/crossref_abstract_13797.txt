This study presents an analysis of risk and resilience perceptions in two villages of Far West Nepal, Sunkuda and Bajedi, located in the upper Karnali River Basin. The area has been affected by deep-seated and shallow landslides, which have had a devastating impact on many rural lives and livelihoods. While both villages are exposed to landslides, Bajedi is situated in a higher risk zone. Using structured surveys, semi-structured interviews and insights from stakeholder workshops, the risk and resilience perceptions of household residents of the two villages are elicited. The objectives of the study are 1) to understand how residents perceive their risk and resilience to landslides, and 2) to provide evidence and insights on the factors that influence risk perception. Results show that landslides are perceived as an existential risk in both villages, although risks are perceived as more serious in Bajedi. The higher risk perception in Bajedi is shown to be mainly driven by households’ ability to cope, including their energy sources, whether they know whom to call in case of a landslides, as well as household savings and income sources. In Sunkuda, risk perception is shown to be influenced by households’ access to and status of community forests, expenditure on medication, the seasonality and types of water sources, and ethnicity. In both villages, additional drivers of risk perception include households’ social networks, their perceived triggers of landslides, their outstanding loans, and who collects the water. The results demonstrate the interconnectedness of risk perception and indicators of resilience. By elucidating the risk perception of Sunkuda and Bajedi, this study has important implications for local risk management strategies and policies.
