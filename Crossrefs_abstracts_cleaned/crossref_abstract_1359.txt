Purpose
This paper aims to discuss how to apply the evolutionary resilience theory in the housing sector, aiming to develop an alternative resilience framework for planning social housing programmes.


Design/methodology/approach
Based on the literature review, it was developed a theoretical framework for building evolutionary resilience. Based on this framework, the outline for the empirical research was specified through interviews with 21 multidisciplinary experts. The statements of these experts were examined through content analysis, as a means to assign a set of requirements for resilient buildings.


Findings
The analysis showed that the holistic framework based on evolutionary resilience could constitute a comprehensive and innovative resilience approach. The main contribution of the set of requirements was to adapt theoretical concepts by proposing operational surrogates, enabling such knowledge to be more applicable to devising resilience to the housing sector.


Originality/value
Resilience is establishing itself as one of the top agendas on the built environment. The construction sector, however, has yet to embrace the concept and little research has been conducted on a practical approach to assess the buildingâ€™s resilience. This paper presents a list of practical requirements showing that the housing sector must to build differently to have a resilient future.
