Abstract
Older adults in extreme poverty refer to “three-noes people”: no working ability, no income source, and no children or legal supporters. They are eligible for a government-funded welfare system called “Five Guarantee system”. The majority of residents in rural welfare institutes are male older adults in extreme poverty. Research demonstrates that resilience is a critical factor in shaping health. This study aims to examine the association between resilience and mental health for male older adults in extreme poverty, and its differences in young-old (60-69 years), old-old (70-79 years), and oldest-old groups (≥80 years). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,427 eligible subjects in rural long-term care facilities from Anhui province in China during 2019, with a response rate of 77.4%. Resilience was measured by the Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, including three subscales of optimism, strength and tenacity. Mental health was assessed using General Health Questionnaire-12. A MANOVA test revealed a significant difference among age groups on three subscales of resilience [Pillai’s Trace=.023, F (6,1486) =2.709, p=.013, ηp2=.012]. Tukey Post hoc indicated the oldest reported significantly lower levels of strength, optimism, and tenacity compared to the other two groups. A multiple logistic regression identified a significant negative association between resilience and mental disorder for the old-old (OR=0.95, 95%CI:0.93-0.97) and oldest-old (OR=0.93, 95%CI: 0.88-0.99) groups. Our findings identified th differences in the link between resilience and mental health within the three different age groups. Resilience-training programs to improve mental health would require targeting specific subscales of resilience for each group.
