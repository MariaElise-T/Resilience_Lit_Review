 Incorporating adaptive resilience as a core value of transportation systems will equip transportation agencies to better address the increasing pace of future changesâ€”both in climate and transportation system performance demands. Quantifiable measures are instrumental in incorporating adaptive resilience in agency organizational frameworks. This paper presents a dashboard tool that evaluates the maturity of adaptive resilience capabilities of a transportation agency, using an Adaptive Resilience (AR) Capability Maturity Model. A demonstrative example is presented to show the potential application of the dashboard tool and its implications for transportation system resilience planning. The example shows how the tool can facilitate identification of adaptive resilience capabilities that are at low maturity and thus may need prioritization for future resilience investments, and capabilities that are at a high maturity level and thus can be leveraged to enhance the lower-level capabilities. The AR performance dashboard tool may be used by transportation agencies to communicate their adaptive resilience efforts and maturity to stakeholders. It can also be used by practitioners to streamline and prioritize process improvements in adaptive resilience efforts.
