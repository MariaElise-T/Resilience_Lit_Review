The motivation of this research (and also one of the nationâ€™s cyber goals) is enhancing the resilience of Industrial Control Systems (ICS)/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems against ransomware attacks. ICS and SCADA systems run some of the most important networks in the country: our critical infrastructure (i.e., water flow, power grids, etc.). Disruption of these systems causes confusion, panic, and in some cases loss of life. We propose a SCADA architecture that uses blockchain to help protect ICS data from ransomware. We focus on the historian. In a SCADA system, the historian collects events from devices in the control network for real-time and future analysis. We choose to use Ethereum and its Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus protocol. The other goal of this research focuses on the resilience of blockchain. There is very little research in protecting the blockchain itself. By performing encryption testing on an Ethereum private network, we explore how vulnerable blockchain is and discuss potential ways to make a blockchain client more resilient.
