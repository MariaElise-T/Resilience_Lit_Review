Whether it is a large-scale complex challenge or a radical change, it is calling for a more resilient and sustainable socio-technical system. Distributed system is a new trend of sustainable transition of socio-technical system. The research on related design strategies of distributed systems can help us better understand the nature of distributed systems, the role of designers, and help designers more calmly deal with future related challenges. This paper has conducted an in-depth understanding and discussion on the resilience of soico-technical systems and the relationship between distributed systems and resilience. We selected three representative cases, combined with a series of response measures taken by China in Wuhan during COVID-19 to analyze. Three types of distributed system design strategies suitable for China are identified.
