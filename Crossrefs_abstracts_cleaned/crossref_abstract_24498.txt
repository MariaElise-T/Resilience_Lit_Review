Fire extinguishing in residential self-built houses is difficult, and casualties are likely to occur. The aim of this study was to improve the fire safety resilience of residential self-built houses and decrease fire safety hazards. Firstly, the connotation of fire resilience of residential self-built houses was scientifically defined according to resilience theory. Then, a fire safety resilience evaluation index system with resistance, response and learning as the core was developed based on the properties of residential self-built houses, legal norms and relevant literature. At the same time, to weaken the effects of subjective factors, a fire safety resilience evaluation model of residential self-built houses was established based on a combination weightingâ€“similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to quantify the influence of each index and divide the resilience level standards. Finally, a practical case of a residential self-built house in Jiaozuo City was adopted for resilience assessment for the verification of the scientificity and rationality of the model. The results showed the following. (1) In the evaluation system, the proportion of the coping and learning stages was 75%, and improving this factor significantly promoted the fire safety resilience of residential self-built houses. (2) Through TOPSIS, the fire safety resilience of residential self-built houses was classified into four groups of poor, medium, good and excellent. (3) By performing an example test, the fire safety resilience level of this residential self-built house was found to be medium, and the evaluation results were basically consistent with the actual situation of the building, which verified the scientificity and rationality of the proposed model.
