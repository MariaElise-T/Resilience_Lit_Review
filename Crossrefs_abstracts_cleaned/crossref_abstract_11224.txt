AbstractAimThis study aimed to investigate the association of personal strength use with job satisfaction among Chinese nurses and to examine the mediating roles of basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience in this association.BackgroundThe topic of nurses’ job satisfaction has been extensively studied worldwide because of its significant effects on nurse turnover, recruitment, and quality of care.MethodsA sample of 417 nurses completed a multi‐section questionnaire that included established scales to measure personal strength use, basic psychological needs satisfaction, resilience, and job satisfaction.ResultsThe results revealed that personal strength use was positively linked to nurses’ job satisfaction. Additionally, basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience mediated the association of personal strength use with job satisfaction both independently and serially.ConclusionPersonal strength use increases nurses’ job satisfaction by satisfying their basic psychological needs and improving their resilience.Implications for nursing and health policyCreating a culture that supports the use of personal strengths among nurses is a promising strategy that hospital managers could consider to enhance nurses’ job satisfaction. Furthermore, implementing programs and interventions to improve nurses’ basic psychological needs satisfaction and resilience could further boost their job satisfaction.
