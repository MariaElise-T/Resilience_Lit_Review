The research evaluated the economics of producing wheat under national innovation on climate resilient agriculture adopted village named karga using zero tillage and conventional method, and it evaluated how much technology and inputs contributed to the higher productivity brought over by zero tillage (ZT). The study found that zero tillage technology is able to increase farmers' profitability and aid in resource conservation. The difference in gross returns between zero tillage and conventional tillage approaches has been divided into 45% related to zero tillage and the remaining due to changes in input costs. This shows that zero tillage practices resulted in better performance in Rabi 2022- 2023 seasons, with an average yield increase of 7.7%. Net income per ha was Rs. 12475 with a reduced cost of cultivation due to reduced number of irrigations and lessened sowing operations cost. Higher yield is due to timely sowing, healthy crop growth, good plant population and less effect of climatic hazard.
