The design and assessment of forest and rural road pavements made from unbound natural and recycled materials require the careful determination of their physical-mechanical properties. The fundamental parameter for characterizing the soil material property is considered to be the resilient modulus Mr. The generally accepted alternative solution for its calculation is the cyclic CBR test, which uses standard CBR testing equipment. To perform tests on intact specimens and under stress conditions corresponding to expected states of stress in a pavement structure, an updated cyclic CBR test is proposed. In contrast to the standard cyclic CBR test, the applied loading force for repeated loadings is not determined in the first loading step by the plunger penetration to the prescribed depth, but by the stress value that is expected in an actual pavement structure. The updated test was verified on 240 tested specimens taken from a total of 40 soil samples belonging to nine soil types according to the USCS system. The resilient modulus results obtained are compared with those obtained using the standard cyclic CBR test and the cyclic triaxial test.
