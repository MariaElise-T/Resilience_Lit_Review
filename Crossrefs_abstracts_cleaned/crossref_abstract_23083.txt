Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that influence graduating students of the dental hygiene department in terms of the effect of their ego resilience and career decision-making self-efficacy on job-seeking stress. Methods: A survey was conducted from October 05, 2022, to October 12, 2022, targeting 163 graduating dental hygiene students at three schools in Busan. The data were analyzed using t-test, one-way ANOVA, Scheffe test, and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Among the identified factors that cause job-seeking stress, career decision-making self-efficacy (β=-0.423, p<0.001), school system (β=-0.320, p<0.05), and subjective health status (β=-0.253, p<0.05) were found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that concerted efforts are required to develop a variety of programs that can increase career decision-making self-efficacy and, in turn, reduce job-seeking stress.
