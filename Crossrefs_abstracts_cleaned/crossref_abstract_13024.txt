Abstract
Children and families are undergoing unprecedented stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part, due to the disruption of daily life arising from mandated social distancing protocols. As such, the purpose of the present report is to raise awareness surrounding resilience-challenging and resilience-promoting factors for refugee children and families during the COVID-19 crisis. Issues surrounding family life, parenting, and potential for family conflict are described. Also, cultural and linguistic factors are discussed, which may limit access to information about the pandemic and, accordingly, uptake of public health recommendations. Throughout our analysis, a trauma-informed framework is utilized, whereby potential for pandemic-related disruption in triggering previous traumatic stress is considered. Furthermore, using a developmental resilience framework and building upon the inherent strengths of families and children, suggestions for developing evidence-based programming and policy are reviewed. Responses should be: (1) multilevel, (2) trauma informed, (3) family focused, (4) culturally and linguistically sensitive, and (5) access oriented. The present analysis can serve as a timely guide for informing program design and policy in the context of public health, social services, mental health, health care, resettlement services, and other refugee-serving organizations.
