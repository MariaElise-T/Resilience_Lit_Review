The aim of this research was to determine resilience and burnout levels among nursing students, and to analyze the relationship between these two variables and the sociodemographic profile of the sample. This sample was composed of 218 second grade nursing students belonging to the University of Murcia. Three instruments were used: an ad hoc questionnaire which included sociodemographic and relationship with peers and teachers questions, a Spanish adaptation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-GS) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). The results showed a high level of emotional exhaustion in 28% of the sample, and a high level of cynicism in 19.7%. In addition, the data support the relationship between resilience and burnout in the sample of students analyzed (r Resilience-emotional fatigue = -0.25, r-Realization Personal Resilience / efficiency = 0.52). In conclusion of the study, we emphasize that students who showed a higher level of resilience experienced less emotional exhaustion and greater personal accomplishment. Similarly, the quality of relationship with teachers was associated with a higher presence of burnout syndrome.
