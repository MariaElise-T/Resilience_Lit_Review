Background: The purpose of the study was to assess the level of such psychosocial resilience resources as self-efficacy, dispositional optimism, and health locus of control in pregnant women with obesity with threatened premature labor. Methods: The study was performed in the years 2017–2020 in a group of 328 pregnant women hospitalized due to threatened preterm labor and diagnosed with obesity before the pregnancy. The following instruments were applied: the Life Orientation Test, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale. Results: Obese pregnant women with threatened premature labor have a moderate level of generalized self-efficacy (28.02) and a moderate level of dispositional optimism (16.20). Out of the three health locus of control dimensions, the highest scores were recorded in the “internal control” subscale (26.08). Statistically significant predictors for the self-efficacy variable model included: satisfactory socio-economic standing (ß = 0.156; p = 0.004), being nulliparous (ß = –0.191; p = 0.002), and the absence of comorbidities (ß = –0.145; p = 0.008). Higher levels of dispositional optimism were found in women who were married (ß = 0.381; p = 0.000), reported a satisfactory socio-economic standing (ß = 0.137; p = 0.005), were between 23 and 27 weeks pregnant (ß = –0.231; p = 0.000), and had no comorbidities (ß = –0.129; p = 0.009). Conclusions: Generalized self-efficacy in obese women with threatened preterm labor is associated with satisfactory socio-economic standing, being nulliparous, and the absence of chronic disease. Dispositional optimism in obese pregnant women with threatened preterm labor is determined by their marital status, socio-economic standing, gestational age, and the absence of comorbidities.
