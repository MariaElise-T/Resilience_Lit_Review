 Objective: There is limited knowledge about whether childhood disadvantage, defined as economic and health disadvantage, influences recovery from functional impairment. Method: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (2008-2010), this research explores whether childhood disadvantage shapes recovery from mobility limitation. In addition, this research examines whether measures of psychosocial resiliency such as mastery, optimism, and religiosity moderate the relationship between childhood disadvantage and recovery. Results: Childhood disadvantage appeared to shape recovery from mobility limitation in later life. Greater number of chronic childhood conditions and low maternal education decreased the odds of recovery. Mastery was a robust predictor of recovery and also a moderator of childhood disadvantage (i.e., moving for financial reasons) and recovery. Discussion: Findings suggest that mastery may be able to diminish the negative effects of financial hardship in childhood on recovery outcomes in later life.
