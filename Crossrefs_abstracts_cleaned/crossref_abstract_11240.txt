PurposeAs global supply chains continue to develop, uncertainty grows and supply chains are frequently threatened with disruption. Although big data technology is being used to improve supply chain resilience, big data technology's role in human–machine collaboration is shifting between “supporters” and “substitutes.” However, big data technology's applicability in supply chain management is unclear. Choosing appropriate big data technology based on the enterprise's internal and external environments is important.Design/methodology/approachThis study built a three-factor structural model of the factors “management support,” “big data technology adoption” and “supply chain resilience”. Big data technology adoption was divided into big data-assisted decision-making technology (ADT) and big data intelligent decision-making technology (IDT). A survey was conducted on more than 260 employees from supply chain departments in Chinese companies. The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling using Analyze of Moment Structures (AMOS) software.FindingsThe study's empirical results revealed that adopting both ADT and IDT improved supply chain resilience. The effects of both types of big data were significant in low-dynamic environments, but the effect of IDT on supply chain resilience was insignificant under high-dynamic environments. The authors also found that government support had an insignificantly effect on IDT adoption but significantly boosted ADT adoption, whereas management support factors promoted both ADT and IDT adoption.Originality/valueBy introducing two types of big data technology from the perspectives of the roles in human–machine collaborative decision-making, the research results provide a theoretical basis and management implications for enterprises to reduce the supply chain risk of enterprises.
