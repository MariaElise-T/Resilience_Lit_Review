 Despite the widespread acceptance of ecological models of child development, the tools and strategies underlying school psychological practice emphasize individual characteristics of children. This article describes ClassMaps Consultation, a consultation strategy that assesses the availability of protective factors and risk in school classrooms and supports interventions to strengthen these so that more students in the classroom are successful. Three underpinnings of ClassMaps Consultation are described: (a) a conceptual framework, (b) a strategy for describing and measuring the ecological characteristics of classrooms, and (c) intervention strategies that target the classroom in lieu of individual students. Then, a case example is provided to illustrate the use of ClassMaps Consultation in two classrooms. Finally, implications for school psychological practice that promotes children's resilience and psychological wellness are presented.
