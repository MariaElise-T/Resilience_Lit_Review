Urban resilience has a significant influence on human safety and security around the
world. As the vast majority of the 21st century population lives in a hazard-networked
reality, urban resilience remains under pressure of multiple factors which force
a need to re-frame it. The research objective is to outline a general concept for
re-framing of urban resilience with respect to gaps to be found in theory and practice
of urban resilience. The methodology bases on a wide-designed literature review
of international base of scientific papers. Theoretical and practical descriptions of
the urban resilience problem allow to identify serious gaps that need to be taken
into account. They can be transformed into requirements and ideas for new frames
of urban resilience. The new framework stems from the state-of-art and, additionally,
allows for the identified gaps. For those reasons, it is worthwhile to consider
those frames in future investigations and in research dedicated to resilience, urban
resilience, disaster risk reduction, disaster management and crisis management.
