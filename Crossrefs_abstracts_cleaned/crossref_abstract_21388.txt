There has been a surge of interest regarding the application of resilience theory in childcare practice and how resilience can be promoted among vulnerable children, in particular, looked after children. However, little is known about how people working with looked after children understand the concept of resilience. This study aimed to explore how social workers, teachers and foster carers, working with looked after children, understand resilience and whether there is consensus as to what constitutes resilience. The study also sought to explore whether there are differences in how resilience is constructed across these groups. In total, 106 participants took part in a Delphi survey (34 teachers, 36 foster carers, 36 social workers). There was moderate consensus that resilience related to survival, coping and a sense of self-worth. Resilience was not considered a panacea but a concept that also had limitations. Participants understood resilience in ways that were both similar and different to existing conceptualisations within the literature. However, there were many aspects of resilience for which there was no consensus or significant difference of opinion between the participant groups. The need for further training and research is discussed, in order to support attempts to promote resilience among looked after children.
