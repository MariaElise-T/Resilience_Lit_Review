Cyber security encompasses a broad range of practices, tools and concepts related closely to those of information and operational technology security. Cyber security is distinctive in its inclusion of the offensive use of information technology to attack adversaries. Use of the term cyber security as a key challenge and a synonym for information security or IT security misleads customers and security practitioners and obscures critical differences between these disciplines. Recommendation for security leaders is that they should use the term cyber security to designate only security practices related to the defensive actions involving or relying upon information technology and/or operational technology environments and systems. Cyber defense is a computer network defense mechanism which includes response to actions and critical infrastructure protection and information assurance for organizations, government entities and other possible networks [3]. In this paper, we investigate how cyber security and cyber defense may lead to cyber resilience with the novel model of cyber resilience designed and presented. Furthermore, within the same model authors investigate actions for cyber security and cyber defense in conditions of increasing challenge of cyber-attacks and the limited capabilities to respond to this threat describing the process of creation, performance and future of EU Cyber Rapid Response Teams (abbr. CRRT) and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security, introducing novel approach to cyber security and cyber defense at the EU level.
