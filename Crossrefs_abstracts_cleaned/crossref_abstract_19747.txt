This study analysed climate change effects concerning the resilience of timber buildings located in southern Chile, specifically in two cities: Collipulli and Temuco (Araucanía Region). A digital fuzzy logic method was used in a set of timber buildings declared as heritage conservation buildings by Chilean Government standards. The outcomes revealed that climate change impacts did not substantially alter the functional performance of the set of heritage timber buildings examined. This study’s results can assist in developing upcoming strategies or recommendations that can support adaptation policies for administering architectural heritage regarding climate change forecasts. These data will invaluably help stakeholders who support the conservation of timber structures located in the southern environment of Chile and under the changing climatic hazard.
