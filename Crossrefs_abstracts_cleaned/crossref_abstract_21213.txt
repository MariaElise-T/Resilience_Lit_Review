AbstractIn intermittent streams, aquatic organisms use various strategies to face dry phases, but the relative contribution of these strategies to persist during dry phase remains unclear. Here, we investigated the in situ persistence of benthic invertebrates in the saturated hyporheic sediments and the “invertebrate seedbank” that persists in dry sediments across six Mediterranean intermittent streams. Taxonomic and functional responses within hyporheic and seedbank assemblages were compared with those in the benthic assemblages under connected flow conditions by combining field and mesocosms data. The dry phase duration in each stream was calculated to assess the responses of hyporheic and seedbank assemblages. Taxonomic composition and abundance-weighted traits related to resistance and resilience to face the dry phase in each assemblage type (benthic, hyporheic, seedbank) were determined. Taxonomic (richness and diversity) and functional (richness and dispersion) metrics were also calculated. We found that seedbank and hyporheic assemblages supported up to 16% and 40% of the benthic taxa, respectively. Only taxonomic and functional richness differed between assemblage types. Contrary to previous research, no clear relationship was established between diversity or the abundance of resistance traits and the duration of dry phase; however, a negative linear relationship was identified between the abundance of resilience traits and the duration of the dry phase. The increase in the frequency and duration of drying events due to climate change will reduce water availability in both saturated and unsaturated streambed sediments, compromising the persistence of aquatic biodiversity in intermittent streams.
