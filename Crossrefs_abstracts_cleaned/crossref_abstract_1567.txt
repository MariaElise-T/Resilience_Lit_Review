The problem of experimentally determining the dynamic characteristics of resilient vibration isolation materials has been solved using two techniques. The test methods, instrumentation and the readouts in terms of impedance and transmissibility are described. Results of impedance and resonance analysis are discussed for several sample materials under different degrees of loading. The results are compared with theoretical values. Static values for materials with high hysteresis are also given in terms of standard stress-strain curves. The differences between static and dynamic spring constants are discussed.
