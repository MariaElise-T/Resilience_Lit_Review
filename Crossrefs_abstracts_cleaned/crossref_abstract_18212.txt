AbstractIn the context of pressures faced by the nursing profession including increasing patient acuity and global nursing shortages, the importance of nurse resilience has gained attention in research and practice. Resilience is viewed as a protective factor that enables individuals to avoid psychological harm and continue in their work. There is limited evidence on the impact of external factors such as work conditions on nurse resilience. This study aimed to explore how external factors influence nurse resilience and to incorporate this knowledge into an updated definition of nurse resilience. As part of a two‐phase mixed methods study, focus groups were conducted to obtain qualitative data to explore nurse's perceptions of resilience and factors they felt affected their resilience. Data analysis identified three main themes derived from 10 subthemes: Perceptions of Resilience, Pressures and Challenges, and Support and Strategies contributed to understanding how external factors can affect nurse resilience. A range of factors emerged including the impact of workplace conditions, organizational philosophy, the performance of managers, and the teams nurses work within, which were not reflected in an earlier definition of nurse resilience derived through a concept analysis. These factors were incorporated in an updated definition of nurse resilience. Understanding resilience in the nursing profession and the external factors that affect it is critical to the development of effective research, policies, interventions, and work environments to protect nurse well‐being, promote nurse retention, and ensure the provision of quality patient care.
