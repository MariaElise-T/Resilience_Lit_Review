This scoping review was undertaken to understand the current intersection of resilience, Christian faith, and social work practice in the professional literature. Five prominent themes emerged that included characteristics of resilience, cultural and communal resilience, spiritual practices,Â  positive and negative spiritual/religious coping, and social work practice principles.
Implications for practice and research are discussed with an emphasis on building the knowledge and literature on Christian spirituality and resilience within the social work field beyond a conceptual understanding.
