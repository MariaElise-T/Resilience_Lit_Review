 Basic studies have been carried out to define the interrelation between thermoplasticity and resilience in cotton obtained through chemical modifications. Diester cross links, introduced in combination with benzoate ester groups, provided neither satisfactory resilience nor thermoplastic character. When benzoylated cotton, prepared by partial saponification from higher DS values or by the Schotten-Baumann esterification condi tions, was dry-cured with trirnethylolmelamine, the products showed high levels of wet and dry wrinkle recovery, high resistance to abrasion, and displayed thermoplastic char acter as reflected by the fact that heat-set creases could be imparted to them.
