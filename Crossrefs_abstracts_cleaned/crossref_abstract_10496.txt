This study aimed to explore the challenges, approaches, and outputs as experienced by educational leaders of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) towards academic resilience. Participants of the study were 14 educational leaders represented by either President or Deans of HEIs in Region XI. This study was conducted last January to June of 2021 and it employed a phenomenology-qualitative research design. Virtual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were utilized as data gathering tools in generating responses. Difficulty in sustaining the quality of education and instructional delivery, lack of faculty training in using technology in instruction delivery, poor internet connectivity and non-availability of teaching gadgets, and not-well managed institutional resources were the themes that emerged from the responses on the challenges faced by educational leaders in achieving academic resilience. Educational leaders employed the following approaches: adapt the new normal situation with a positive mindset; implement flexible learning; apply innovative leadership in handling resources and operations of HEIs; intensify faculty development; and collaborate with teachers, stakeholders, partner â€“ institutions, and other agencies. The output of the approaches shows that educational leaders were able to build resilience amid the new normal situation and improved efficiency in delivering its services. The results implied that challenges make the educational leaders more innovative, positive, determined, and collaborative. The management of higher education institutions may assess the Learning Management System, evaluate the results of the approaches of educational leaders, and craft relevant policies to fully achieve academic resilience.
