Abstract
Few interventions have targeted resilience resources in people living with HIV (PLWH). We tested the acceptability of an existing resilience intervention in middle-age and older PLWH. Fourteen PLWH attended one 3-hr group session, which included videos, quizzes, and written activities. Participants provided quantitative and qualitative feedback. The mean acceptability rating was 8.71 (1.27) on a 10-point scale. A majority of participants reported that the intervention was an appropriate length; that it improved their resilience, mood, and ability to manage HIV; and that they would likely continue using the tools. Average content retention accuracy was 75% (12.66). Qualitative feedback suggested addressing HIV-specific stressors, including disclosure concerns, stigma, health concerns, and treatment adherence. The resilience intervention was deemed highly acceptable among older PLWH. Uptake may increase by addressing HIV-specific stressors and improving comprehensibility. Future research should further refine and test the efficacy of a modified version of the intervention.
