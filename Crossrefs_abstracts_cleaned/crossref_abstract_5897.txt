Lately, neuroscience has proven key in providing scientific answers to research conducted in other disciplines. Resilience, from the point of view of neuroscience, takes on a new meaning due to the lockdown experienced under the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is the result of an investigation carried out during confinement in Spain, Mexico and Chile. It shows the preliminary results of the analysis of stress risk factors and resilience in neuroscience, identifying possible stress risk factors using socio-demographic data. A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational and comparative study was conducted in a sample of 784 participants. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10) was used to identify resilience traits. The findings reveal a non-significant result among the countries, but statistically significant results in the level of education variable, which is associated with cognitive flexibility. The possible stress risk factors did not evince significant results. Thus, promoting resilience at an early age comes as a relevant finding. As argued by epigenetics, to immerse oneself in contexts where meaningful bonds are promoted, is essential to improve vital processes such as resilience and prevent potential stress risk factors.
