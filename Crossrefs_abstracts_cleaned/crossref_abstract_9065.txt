This research investigates the feasibility of using mobile hybrid microgrids to increase energy resilience in DoD Installations. The primary question examined is whether a standardized mobile microgrid, constrained within an International Standards Organization (ISO) Triple Container (TriCon) and not to exceed 10,000 lbs (approximately 4535 kg), can provide the necessary power for small critical sites with an average 10 kW load on DoD installations with similar resilience to a customized single load microgrid or emergency backup generator. Key assumptions for this research are that power outages may be accompanied by a fuel constrained environment (e.g., natural disaster that restricts fuel transport), an existing installation microgrid is in place, and the risk of outages does not warrant the development of redundant customized single load microgrids for each critical load. The feasibility of a mobile hybrid microgrid is investigated by constructing an architectural design that attempts to find a satisfactory combination of commercial off-the-shelf components for battery energy storage, photovoltaic power, and generator power within the constraints of an 8 ft × 6 ft 5 in × 8 ft (approximately 2.4 m × 2 m × 2.4 m) shipping container. The proposed design is modeled and simulated over a two-week period using Global Horizontal Index solar irradiance data, and a randomized average 10 kW load. Results of the model are used to analyze the feasibility of the system to meet the load while reducing dependency on fuel resources. Trade-offs between a customized single load microgrid and standardized mobile microgrid are discussed. The result of this research indicates that a standardized mobile microgrid holds significant promise for DoD and other potential users (public safety, private industry, etc.) in having a rapidly deployable solution to bring critical loads back online during an emergency situation that reduces generator usage.
