In this work, the cultivation of river shrimp was implemented through intensive use of solar radiation for the sustainable development of the Camarones, a village in Chile. An aquaculture production plant was built under water recirculation to produce 8000 k of river shrimp and rainbow trout per year, in a 25:75 ratio, respectively. This was developed taking into account (1) the concept of how to help resilient communities, considering the principles of the circular economy; (2) that the cultivation of these species will use solar water treatment technology to reduce arsenic content present in the natural waters of the Camarones River; and (3) how to add value to the residues obtained from the production plant for better agriculture and to have water to preserve the ecosystem. In addition, this initiative will rely on solar energy and radiation to produce electrical energy and a photochemical reaction to remove arsenic from the water. This work complies with 10 of the 11 principles of the Circular Economy, making it a potential alternative for all areas of the world that have similar characteristics.
