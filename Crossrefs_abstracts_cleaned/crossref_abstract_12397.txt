Background: mHealth apps are showing promise as an accessible means to improve mental health and wellbeing. However, there is limited evidence for their efficacy, particularly in periods after their initial usage, and in non-Western cultures. Objective: In this study, we explored the impact of eQuoo, an emotional fitness application which gamifies self-reflection and learning, in terms of its ability to build resilience in a sample of young people in Vietnam. Materials and Methods: Individuals (n = 264, M = 25.65 years, SD = 4.84; 52% female) completed self-reports consisting of three different measures of resilience (the Rugged Resilience Measure, Adult Resilience Measure, Brief Resilience Scale). Assessments were taken at the start and end of a five-week use period, and also three months after baseline. Results: Comparison tests indicated various improvements in resilience between baseline and five weeks and at three months, depending on the subgroup of participants (whether male or female or younger or older), as well as in terms of the way resilience was operationalised (e.g., ability to ‘bounce back’ or the protective factors associated with managing adversity). Conclusion: The study indicates that eQuoo can build resilience and can therefore provide a convenient means of supporting the mental health and wellbeing of young adults.
