Drought stress is becoming the most important factor of global warming in forests, hampering the production of reproductive material with improved resilience. Previously, we reported that heat-priming maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) megagametophytes during SE produced epigenetic changes that generated plants better adapted to subsequent heat stress. In this work, we tested, in an experiment performed under greenhouse conditions, whether heat-priming will produce cross-tolerance to mild drought stress (30 days) in 3-year-old priming-derived plants. We found that they maintain constitutive physiological differences as compared to controls, such as higher proline, abscisic acid, starch, and reduced glutathione and total protein contents, as well as higher Î¦PSII yield. Primed plants also displayed a constitutive upregulation of the WRKY transcription factor and the Responsive to Dehydration 22 (RD22) genes, as well as of those coding for antioxidant enzymes (APX, SOD, and GST) and for proteins that avoid cell damage (HSP70 and DHNs). Furthermore, osmoprotectants as total soluble sugars and proteins were early accumulated in primed plants during the stress. Prolongated water withdrawal increased ABA accumulation and negatively affected photosynthesis in all plants but primed-derived plants recovered faster than controls. We concluded that high temperature pulses during somatic embryogenesis resulted in transcriptomic and physiological changes in maritime pine plants that can increase their resilience to drought stress, since heat-primed plants exhibit permanent activation of mechanisms for cell protection and overexpression of stress pathways that pre-adapt them to respond more efficiently to soil water deficit.
