Abstract
Greenhouse gas (GHG), which is a determining factor in climate change is a result of human activities, namely climate change is human-caused (anthropogenic). Cities, where 60% of the world's population of approximately 7.3 billion living today, are responsible for 60-80% consumption of energy, which is the lifeblood of intense human activities, thus at least 70% of GHG. Nevertheless, cities are the cause of climate change and other global environmental problems, as well as the innovation centres and laboratories to deal with their impact. With climate change becoming more explicit and active in the 21st century, researchers, governments and international institutions question citiesâ€™ strength/vulnerability against these problems, especially their energy production and consumption patterns that cause GHG, and they anticipate that urban resilience be the motivating force for urban policies. The widespread and effective use of renewable energy is regarded as an influential tool against climate change. However, this should be endorsed by spatial strategies. In the light of this approach, this study evaluates the urban form, building design and production technologies that are focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy use.
