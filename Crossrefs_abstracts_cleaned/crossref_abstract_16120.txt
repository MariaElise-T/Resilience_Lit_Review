Abstract
There are primarily two policy perspectives to global warming: “climate change mitigation” and “adaptation.” Both the approaches are distinct. ‘Climate change mitigation’ seeks to prevent further global climate change, whereas climate change adaptation seeks to adapt to local climate change. It is an intriguing discovery that adaptation and its corelative “resilience” in the context of climate change are a developing field of study. This paper reflects on the statistical data collected on the research publications carried out on the concepts of ‘climate change ‘mitigation’ and ‘resilience’. The analysis has been done by using the bibliometric method for the time span from 2011-2022. The data of 193 documents has been retrieved from the Scopus database in the subject area by using the keywords “climate resilience and mitigation”. For studying the global trend and establishing the connections between the subfields, sources, affiliations, and for authorship collaboration VOS viewer software has been used. The present work investigates the quantum of research performed on the concepts of climate change mitigation and resilience. The analysis demonstrates the publications in various subfields of climate change mitigation and resilience, in various sources and under different affiliations. It focuses on the global trend on this crucial issue relating to the environment protection and sustainable development.
