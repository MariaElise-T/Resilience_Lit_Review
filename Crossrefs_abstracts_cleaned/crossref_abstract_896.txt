Background: Lifeline critical infrastructures are pivotal for the uninterrupted flow of goods and services that are crucial to the functioning of society (Singh, 2021). This review will be the second in a series of four systematic literature reviews examining the resilience and sustainability of critical lifeline infrastructures in Australia, with a focus on the state of Tasmania. The first SLR examined energy infrastructure. The recent passing of the 2021 Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill in Australia, coupled with the lack of a governing document at the state level in Tasmania, necessitates a review to uncover the governance settings, which will aide in increasing the resilience and sustainability of water infrastructures, contributing to broader critical lifeline infrastructure resilience, in Tasmania.
Methods/Design: Following the 2015 PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), the review focuses on scholarly sources that address the governance of water infrastructures. In addition to governance settings, secondary evidence is sought regarding interruptions to water infrastructures; policy problems and solutions; and resilience and sustainability definitions.
Discussion: Findings from this review will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how the resilience and sustainability of water infrastructures may be enhanced via deeper knowledge of their governance settings. This research is directed at Tasmanian policy-makers, practitioners, industry specialists, and researchers to inform and enhance their decision-making on this important topic.
