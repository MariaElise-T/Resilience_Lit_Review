Background:
Patients on hemodialysis are at a high risk of psychiatric disorders as they
face an emotional challenge in addition to physical impairment.


Objective:
This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety among a sample of
patients with end-stage renal disease on regular dialysis, and the effect of resilience and social support
on them.


Methods:
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 45 patients who had been on hemodialysis
for the past three months. Anxiety and depression were assessed with a clinical interview. The severity
of depression, perceived social support, and resilience were assessed using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI), Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Resilience
Scale, respectively.


Result:
The mean age of enrolled patients was 49.2 ± 14.0 years, and the mean duration of hemodialysis
was 4.5 ± 3.8 years. The prevalence of depression was 24.4% and that of anxiety was 20%.
According to our analysis, 15 (33.3%) patients were diagnosed with minor depression, 6 (13.3%)
with mild depression, 14 (31.1%) with moderate depression, and 10 (22.2%) with severe depression.
Resilience correlated significantly with a psychiatric diagnosis (p=0.004). Perceived social support
was also found to be significantly correlated with a psychiatric diagnosis (p=0.012).


Conclusion:
Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders in patients with CKD and are
considered as the main determinants of quality of life and death rate. Increasing awareness, early
evaluation, and management of depression and anxiety may improve the functional, social, and
clinical outcomes of the patients with CKD.
