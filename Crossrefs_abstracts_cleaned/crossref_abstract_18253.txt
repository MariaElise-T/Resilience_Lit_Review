Abstract
This study aims to figure out the level of mathematical resilience and mathematical problem-solving abilities of 11th grade sciences students in a senior high school. The subjects of the study were 63 senior high school students in 11th grade sciences, second semester 2018/2019 year who were studied at one of the senior high school in Baleendah, Bandung regency. This research method is a survey, in which the survey is included in one type of research is non experimental. The study design used is cross-sectional designs. There are two sorts of instruments used for this study, namely test and non-test instruments. Test instruments serve for measuring the level of mathematical problem-solving abilities of students, while non-test instruments are in the form of questionnaires, useful for measuring the level of mathematical resilience of students. The results showed that (1) the level of students’ mathematical resilience is in the medium level, and (2) the level of students’ mathematical problem-solving ability is in the medium level.
