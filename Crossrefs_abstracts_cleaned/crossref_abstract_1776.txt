The article provides a brief theoretical review of domestic research on resiliency. It focuses on the study of resiliency from the perspective of the subject approach, and defines the criteria for the resiliency of the subject. Scientific approaches to the study of the concept of "personal resources" are considered. The author assumes the presence of personal characteristics that are the resources of the subject's resiliency. The problem of the phenomenon of self-acceptance as a subject characteristic is discussed. The analysis of scientific approaches allows us to conclude that self-acceptance by activating the processes of self-knowledge, initiating mechanisms of self-regulation, has a stable positive impact on maintaining the subject's resiliency, which is manifested in a person's desire for self-improvement, self-actualization, and achievement of goals.
