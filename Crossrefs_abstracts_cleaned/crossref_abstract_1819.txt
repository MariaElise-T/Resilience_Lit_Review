AbstractPrevious studies have mainly focused on examining families' struggles during the adaptive process of adversity, while the strength of family and how it arises were neglected. This study aims to explore the relationships between individual and family resilience among parents and children in families during COVID‐19. Guided by the longitudinal actor–partner interdependence model, one parent and a child in 136 Chinese families completed assessments of pandemic media exposure and individual resilience in mid‐February 2020 and family resilience in early March. Results showed that the child's individual resilience was positively associated with their own and their parents’ family resilience, while parents' resilience was only positively associated with their own. The evidence indicated that a child's individual resilience was critical for all core family members' perceived family resilience and provided implications for family intervention programs.
