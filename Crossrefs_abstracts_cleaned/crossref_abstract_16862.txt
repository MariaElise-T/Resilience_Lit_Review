Natural Functional Foods (NFFs) are unprocessed foods with proven health benefits beyond their nutritional value. The Mediterranean Diet (MD) and Mediterranean Lifestyle (MEDILIFE) are well known for their beneficial effects on health. Psychological Resilience (PsyR) is not only an important factor in human well-being; it is also regarded as a key indicator of mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between NFFs and the MD and MEDILIFE in Greece, as well as their association with PsyR and other health-related parameters. In a cross-sectional design, 338 healthy adults participated voluntarily in an online research survey. There was a statistically significant association between the consumption of NFFs grown and produced in the Mediterranean region and the MD and MEDILIFE (p < 0.001). When the MD and MEDILIFE associated NFFs scores were summed up to form a 10-item scale (NAFFAME), the NAFFAME had a statistically significant positive correlation with PsyR (p < 0.001) and sleep quality (p < 0.05) and a negative correlation with body mass index (p < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the means of the NAFFAME score on different weight loss diet outcomes. Multinomial regression analysis identified the NAFFAME score as a prognostic factor in maintaining weight loss after a diet (OR: 1.119, 95% CI: 1.035, 1.208, p < 0.01 compared with no weight loss). This study identified NFFs as a part of the MD and MEDILIFE. NFFs linked to the MEDILIFE could help predict the outcome of a weight loss diet and appear to have a positive effect on PsyR, sleep quality, and maintaining a healthy weight. Thus, the consumption of NFFs grown and produced in the Mediterranean region could be a natural, healthy, and sustainable way of enhancing physicalâ€“mental health. Randomised controlled trials should be conducted to confirm the findings of this cross-sectional study.
