When a disaster occurs, the community health center is badly damaged by the disaster, causing major disruption to health services, so efforts are needed to increase the resilience of the community health center. This study aims to compare the resilience index of community health center in flood-prone areas of East Java Province, Indonesia. This type of analytic observational research is a cross sectional design carried out community health center in East Java Province which was taken by a total sampling of 60 community health center from October 2021 to March 2022. The data analysis used was independent t test. The analyses results with independent t test show that there is a significant difference in the average resilience score of the community health centers between the flooded and non-flooded community health centers groups with p value < 0.05. Furthermore, the flooded and non-flooded community health center resilience scores were higher than those that were not flooded. Structural, non-structural, and functional toughness are indicators of building community health centers' resilience.
