AbstractResearchers in this study used a phenomenological approach (Moustakas, 1994) to conduct and analyze interviews of 15 Latinx and Asian immigrants and refugees who shared their pre‐migration, migration, and post‐migration experiences. The participants were also asked to describe their perceived counseling needs at each stage of their journey. Four themes were identified: dire decisions, resilience and perseverance, trauma and loss, and human rights violations. Implications include the need for counselors to understand the journey experiences of immigrants and refugees, recognize their resilience and perseverance, and engage in advocacy‐based counseling approaches that are essential when supporting clients who identify as immigrants or refugees during their resettlement and post‐immigration period.
