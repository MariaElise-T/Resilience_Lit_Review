The demand for cloud computing has drastically increased recently, but this paradigm has several issues due to its inherent complications, such as non-reliability, latency, lesser mobility support, and location-aware services. Fog computing can resolve these issues to some extent, yet it is still in its infancy. Despite several existing works, these works lack fault-tolerant fog computing, which necessitates further research. Fault tolerance enables the performing and provisioning of services despite failures and maintains anti-fragility and resiliency. Fog computing is highly diverse in terms of failures as compared to cloud computing and requires wide research and investigation. From this perspective, this study primarily focuses on the provision of uninterrupted services through fog computing. A framework has been designed to provide uninterrupted services while maintaining resiliency. The geographical information system (GIS) services have been deployed as a test bed which requires high computation, requires intensive resources in terms of CPU and memory, and requires low latency. Keeping different types of failures at different levels and their impacts on service failure and greater response time in mind, the framework was made anti-fragile and resilient at different levels. Experimental results indicate that during service interruption, the user state remains unaffected.
