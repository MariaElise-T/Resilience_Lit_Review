Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper is to study resilience among micro and small wineries. While the subject of organisational resilience has drawn the attention or numerous researchers, there is an argument that limited empirical evidence exist to support different theoretical constructs in regards to resilience. Thus, the paper addresses a knowledge gap. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – A questionnaire was designed to investigate strategies that can help businesses to become more resilient to contemporary challenges. A total of 273 owners and managers of Italian wineries participated in the study. 


Findings
 – Increasing costs, institutional barriers and the effects of the economic crisis on consumers’ wine purchases are perceived as most serious challenges. One fundamental impact is respondents’ loss of trust in institutions. Alternatives such as diversifying, knowledge of foreign languages and educational activities emerged as crucial to improve wineries’ performance, and therefore build their resilience. 


Practical implications
 – These findings highlight the vital role of institutions in developing supporting strategies to nurture an entrepreneurial culture among owners and managers of a very important group of businesses. 


Originality/value
 – By empirically investigating ways to achieve resilience among businesses of a traditional European sector, the study addresses a knowledge gap identified in contemporary research. The study also contributes to the development of the theory of resilience, for instance, by considering the literature on the theory of resilience, considering and adopting factors affecting micro and small enterprises’ resilience and identifying some of these factors in the context of micro and small wine enterprises.
