Abstract
In the field of public heritage valorisation through renovation, resilience assessment is crucial to foresee the impact of each project action, monitor the transformability thresholds and achieve more sustainable restoration projects. Within this framework, methodologies to achieve early evaluation of different project alternatives since the very preliminary design phases are supposed to be a key factor for the success of the building process, as it is highlighted by the Italian public procurement code (D.Lgs 50/2016). Therefore, the role of the contracting authority is crucial, as it is called both to activate the process through the definition of the project requirements and to accomplish the evaluation of the proposed solutions by respecting the principles of public interests, legality, transparency and responsibility.
In order to achieve these goals, the research proposes a standard methodology composed of a list of synthetic indicators and the criteria for their combination, aiming to assess the residual performances of the building and evaluate the compliance with new intended uses through the match with a set of conceivable design strategies. In this direction, two assessment tools are defined: the PAV (Performance Adequacy and Vulnerability), which is calculated on the actual state of the building for the evaluation of its residual efficiency with reference to some transformative hypothesis and then integrated in a grid of design strategies, and the RTE (Resilience Threshold Evaluation) though to measure the expected transformative impacts on the building and their positive or negative implications within its resilience thresholds.
The methodology is implemented in a BIM-based process with the definition of a simplified informative model that makes it possible to retrieve all the information and to define the calculation rules in order to activate the defined methodology with the advantage of ensuring time-saving, data-safety and transparency in the process.
