An anticipated challenge for the offshore wind industry is the legally standardized decommissioning of offshore wind infrastructure after the expiration of the respective approval period. To meet the energy and climate targets set by, e.g., the German Federal Government, this challenge must be mastered in the context of sustainability. Potential concepts are (i) the deconstruction of offshore infrastructure without replacement, (ii) the continued operation of the plants, (iii) partially or even completely replacing them with newer, modernized plants (re-powering). Re-powering could also be a combination of existing infrastructures with other innovative technologies, such as hydrogen. In this work, the three concepts are analyzed along with their risks and additional factors, such as feasibility, cost-effectiveness, predictability of technological progress, and, planning security, are discussed. A quantitative risk and resilience analysis is conceptually demonstrated for the specific risk of extreme weather and wave conditions caused by climate change. Synthetic wave height data are generated and the corresponding load changes are applied to example offshore wind farms. The three end-of-life options are compared using resilience indicators that serve as exemplary measures for the energy output, which serves as the key performance indicator.
