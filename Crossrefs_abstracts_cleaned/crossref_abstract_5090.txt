Community emergency management is directly related to the safety of peopleâ€™s lives and properties and is concerned with economic development and social stability. This paper established an evaluation model of community emergency management capacity from the perspective of resilience based on hierarchical analysis (AHP) and distance between superior and inferior solutions (TOPSIS). In terms of infrastructure resilience, community organizational resilience, risk, and hidden danger management, emergency material security, emergency force construction, emergency literacy, and the evaluation index system of resilient community emergency management capacity were improved. By the AHP method, the weights of all indexes were determined scientifically. Combined with the TOPSIS method, the fit of the evaluated object which between the positive and negative ideal solution was calculated to determine the optimal evaluation among multiple experts. According to the validated assessment, the low-scoring indicators were analyzed to make practical suggestions for improvement. The results provide new theoretical methods and technical support for the assessment of community emergency response capacity, which also provides reference for the assessment of emergency response capacity in other fields.
