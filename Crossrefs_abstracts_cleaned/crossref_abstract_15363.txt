This technical paper focuses on efficient error-handling techniques within Lambda functions and offers helpful insights into connecting AWS Lambda with an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Engineers can find practical solutions in the discussion, including illustrated code snippets and focusing on synchronous and asynchronous invocation types. The article examines the architectural concerns of using an AWS Lambda as the backend for an ALB. With the ALB-to-Lambda architecture in mind, methods for improving error resilience in Lambda functions in sync and async invoke types are discussed. The report also discusses the subtle differences between throttle and error, two vital metrics. Using real-world examples, engineers will get the skills to implement reliable error-handling procedures adapted to various invocation kinds. The insights offered serve as a brief yet thorough reference for maximizing the performance of AWS Lambda behind an ALB, guaranteeing efficient error management, and tackling the particular difficulties brought forth by sync and async invocations. This tool provides engineers with practical approaches that will enable them to build robust serverless applications in the AWS cloud
