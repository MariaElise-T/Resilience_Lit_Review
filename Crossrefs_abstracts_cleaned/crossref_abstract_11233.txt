AbstractNowadays there is an increase of attention from the international organizations to resilience of development, suggesting that the concept of sustainability is gradually being replaced by resilience as a development goal. The article explains the need to adapt the theory of regional resilience in Russian researches and determines the prerequisites for the formation that theory. The definitions of the concept of “resilience” from different areas of knowledge, including regional economic and fiscal resilience, are given, and the basic properties and and factors influencing regional resilience are determined. Based on 17 economic, social and financial indicators, an integral resilience index was determined for the Russia's regions, which revealed resilient and non‐resilient regions. According to the study, authors have confirmed the relationship between fiscal and socio‐economic resilience.
