Background: Fear of hypoglycemia is an important problem in individuals with diabetes and could produce a negative impact on blood glucose control and quality of life in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Aim: To analyze (1) the associations among resilience, diabetes-related quality of life, and anxiety and depression in patients with type 1 diabetes with fear of hypoglycemia and (2) whether anxiety and depression mediate the relationship between resilience and quality of life. Design: A non-experimental, descriptive correlational design was used. Methods: Participants were 30 patients with type 1 diabetes with fear of hypoglycemia. Data were collected using several questionnaires administered between September 2019 and March 2020. Results: Resilience played a significant role in the anxiety and depression that accompanies diabetes. Mediation analysis was performed to assess whether the association between resilience and quality of life was mediated by anxiety and depression in series. The results show that the effect of resilience was mainly mediated by anxiety but not by depression. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that high resilience could be a protective factor against the development of psychological symptomatology, which has a high prevalence in chronic conditions such as diabetes and can improve quality of life. Impact: Our study addresses the relationship between the positive psychological characteristic of resilience and anxiety, depression, and quality of life and the association between these variables. The results indicate that resilience has a positive impact on quality of life in people with type 1 diabetes who experience fear of hypoglycemia. Moreover, health professionals who provide care to these individuals should consider implementing programs to build resilience.
