Abstract
In light of the crisis situations the world over, resilience of organizations has become an increasingly important practical and theoretical issue. This research examines the characteristics of resilience in public organizations during the early stages of a security-related crisis. Based on personal interviews with 32 managers and employees in local social service departments and community centers who experienced the crisis as part of their jobs, the most prominent characteristic that contributed to resilience was the propensity to act. Characteristics that undermined resilience were also identified. The article discusses the characteristics of resilience identified and their implementation, as well as the need during a crisis to break away from routine organizational patterns and the planning that can develop organizational resilience.
