The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is currently spreading in Indonesia has prompted the government to implement various prevention efforts to limit its spread. One of the sectors affected by this pandemic is the education sector, owing to the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kementrian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan) of the Republic of Indonesia instruction to higher education institutions to implement the Study from Home (SFH) policy. This causes abrupt changes and considerable pressures on college students both internally and externally, which might trigger negative emotions, including stress in undergoing Study from Home (SFH). This study aims to explore the correlation between academic resilience and the subjective well-being of college students experiencing online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses a literature review to collect data, focusing on theoretical studies, and the references used are inseparable from scientific literature. The results show that resilience is crucial in online learning to maintain and improve the studentsâ€™ subjective well-being. Students with a high level of resilience tend to have a high level of subjective well-being as well, meaning that they are able to regulate their emotions better in addition to controlling internal pressures caused by online learning.
