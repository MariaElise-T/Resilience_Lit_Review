In Korea, resilient materials such as EPS and EVA are used to reduce the floor impact sound between adjacent houses in apartment. With the revision of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOTT) Notice, new apartment buildings are required to construct concrete slabs of 210 mm or more and to ensure floor construction with impact insulation performance within 4th grades. However, most of the apartment buildings approved by the government prior to the enactment of the related laws in 2004 are usually constructed with a slab thickness of 120--150 mm, causing disputes and complaints over floor impact sound. This study investigated the mechanical properties like as dynamic stiffness, loss factor, compressibility, dimensional stability, etc., of resilient materials for remodeling of aged apartments. About 200 kinds of resilient materials and structures applied in commonly in recently 3 years were selected and investigated. Because of notification revision including compressibility and dimensional stability, dynamic stiffness of resilient materials was increased and lots of composite layer resilient structures were developed. In addition, it is necessary to develop a resilient materials or structures that can reduce the total thickness of floor structure because the aged apartment has low indoor height.
