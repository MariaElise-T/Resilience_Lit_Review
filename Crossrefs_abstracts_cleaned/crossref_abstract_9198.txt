Resilience and sustainability have each offered a path forward for post-COVID economic recovery and a post-Glasgow global financial order. Yet, the relationships between these two concepts are largely unexplored in economic policy and investment strategies. In light of emerging systemic risks and global demands for more resolute investments in resilience and sustainability, this perspective article took the position that policymakers must begin to draw greater conceptual, empirical, and practical linkages between sustainability and resilience. This perspective article provided a simplified framework for understanding the positively reinforcing, negatively conflicting, and neutral relationships between different types of resilience and sustainability consistent with two propositions. The Reinforcement Proposition argues (i) that various resilience processes may drive sustainable outcomes, and/or (ii) that an allocation of sustainable resources may reinforce resilience processes, as well as the transformative adaptation of markets. Conversely, the Conflict Proposition argues (i) that certain resilience processes may perpetuate stability features that may thwart an economic transition toward sustainability, and/or (ii) that certain sustainability outcomes associated with reorganized economic structures and relationships may undermine resources for resilience. This framework provides policymakers with an opportunity to evaluate the convergent and conflicting trade-offs of resilience processes and sustainable outcomes.
