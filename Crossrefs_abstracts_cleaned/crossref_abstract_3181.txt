Abstract
This article assesses Syria’s agriculture under conflict by employing newly published official data up until 2019. It explains how the land reforms of the 1960s and state support for the farming sector have represented a buffer against hunger and famine as Syria was plunged into war. It reviews Syria’s agricultural history from the period after independence until the year of the uprising. The fact that Syria, despite a decade of war has survived without famine vindicates the point that state support for agriculture in developing formations is central to food, development and national securities. Insofar as reconstruction effort is concerned, a re-emphasis on rejuvenating the farming sector can become the building block to enhancing capacity across all other sectors. The paper concludes that resilience in agriculture and nationally nurtured food security in Syria have supplemented its capabilities to fend off the imperialist assault and safeguard territorial integrity.
