SummaryIn this paper, the problem of composite adaptive anti‐disturbance resilient control is investigated for Markovian jump systems with partly known transition rate and multiple disturbances. The considered multiple disturbances include two types: one is external disturbance, while the other is an unexpected nonlinear signal which is described as a nonlinear function. Composite adaptive disturbance observers are constructed to estimate these disturbances, and the estimations are applied to feedforward compensation. Then a composite adaptive anti‐disturbance resilient controller is obtained. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities such that the closed‐loop system is stochastically stable with 
 performance. Finally, a numerical example and an application example are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
