Psychological resilience is a dynamic psychological phenomenon that is the result of a natural combination of biological, individual-personal, and social factors. The aim of the study was to reveal the associations between the manifestations of psychological resilience and the content of the neurotransmitter dopamine. In our study, it was found that a high level of dopamine in blood plasma is associated with post-traumatic growth, which is expressed here in the manifestation of compassion, the desire to establish closer and trusting relationships with other people (the “Attitude to others” scale, r = 0.344, р = 0.01). In addition, the high content of dopamine corresponds to the ability to adequately perceive a social role and the responsible attitude to the rules of behavior accepted in society (the “Moral normativity” scale, r = 0.424, р = 0.01). A contradictory result should be recognized as a negative correlation between the dopamine level and the manifestations of personal growth, measured by the K. Ryff Scale of Psychological Well-being (r = -0.564, р = 0.01). Risk-taking is a predictor of psychological stability (t = 5.144, р = 0.000), programming(t = 3.020, р = 0.005) and the dopamine level (t = 2.204, р = 0.036). According to the results obtained, awareness of self-development is determined by such predictors as flexibility (t = 3.082, р = 0.005), reflexive overcoming (t = 5.711, р = 0.000), the power of personality (t = 4.984, р = 0.000), relationship with others (t = -3.203, р = 0.003) and the dopamine level (t = -4.680, р = 0.000).
