This study focused on frontline healthcare workersâ€™ engagement level, since they are confronting multiple challenges during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was significant to study how spirituality breeds resilience and engagement in prevailing critical scenarios. The study also investigates the significant role of psychosocial safety climate (PSC). A cross-sectional online survey of 233 healthcare professionals was collected in Pakistan. By using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), this study tests the research hypotheses. The findings suggest that spirituality plays an essential role in effecting resilience and engagement of healthcare workers. The resilience, in fact, mediates the effect of spirituality on work engagement. In addition, PSC proved to be a strong moderator in the relationship of spirituality and resilience. Implications and future recommendations are discussed.
