 If there is a relatively low reduction in the original deforming stress applied to an elastomer seal which is subjected to a constant compression during its practical use, this may result in a considerable drop in its resilience and the sealing capacity associated with this. The degree of the stress relaxation caused by a specific reduction in the initial deforming stress in addition to the viscoelastic and ageing processes in the elastomer was determined for six vulcanisates and a thermoplastic elastomer during long-term storage at 23, 70 and 1000Â°C. The stress relaxation values determined in this way were compared to the results of stress relaxation tests performed according to DIN 53 537 (method B). In parallel to the relaxation measurements, a determination was made of the compression set which is obtained if the heated and deformed test pieces are cooled to room temperature in the clamping device before the stress is removed.
