Rock sheds have been widely used to protect against rockfall. Traditionally, a cushion layer is placed on the top of a rock shed to reduce the impact force and dissipate energy. However, heavy cushion layers lead to high dead loads and increased construction costs. This paper discusses the concept of an impact-resilient flexible buffer structure. On the basis of that concept, it also proposes a buffer structure mainly composed of springs, ring nets, spring rods, and support ropes, which can be used to replace the traditional cushion layer on a shed for rockfall protection. Full-scale impact tests were conducted to study the impact-resilient characteristic of the structure combined with numerical simulation. The dynamic responses of the buffer structure, including force, deformation, and energy dissipation, were analysed in depth. Finally, parametric numerical simulations of 33 models were conducted; the spring stiffness of these models ranged from 300 kN/m to 1500 kN/m; the impact energy ranged from 100 kJ to 2000 kJ. Moreover, simple approaches for estimating the impact force and braking distance of the buffer structure were proposed and verified using measured data obtained from the impact test.
