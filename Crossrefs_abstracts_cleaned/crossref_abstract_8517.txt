PurposeThis paper aims to develop a framework that could establish and further the terminology of smart city/resilient city discourse in that resilience could support urban “smartness”, a term that is widely argued being not easily measured nor quantifiably assessed.Design/methodology/approachThe qualitative approach was employed, and based on selected keywords, a systematic literature review was carried out to understand the main themes within the smart city and resilient city concepts databases. Upon screening, 86 papers were used and synthesised through the meta-synthesis method using both synthesis approach, meta-aggregation and meta-ethnography that systematically identifies both properties and characteristics, to build an innovative framework as an indicator-based smart/resilience quantification model.FindingsTwo novel frameworks are proposed, smart resilient city (SRC) and resilient smart city (RSC), as guidelines regulatory that establish a city's smartness and resilience.Research limitations/implicationsThe quantitative research phase is not provided as the framework builds on the exploratory approach in which the model is proposed through the postulation of data definitions.Practical implicationsAlthough the study's scope was limited to the city, proposed frameworks may be interpreted for other contexts that deal with the topic of resilience and smart.Originality/valueThe established framework proposal would encourage further exploration in context, serving as an inspiration for other scholars, decision-makers, as well as municipalities to keep strengthening smart city through resilience factors.
