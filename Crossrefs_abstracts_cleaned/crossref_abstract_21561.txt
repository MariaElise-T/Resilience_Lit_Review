BACKGROUND: Natural disasters led to environmental destruction, casualties, and fatality. Disasters have been associated with post-traumatic disorders among affected community, thus, it is important to understand capability and resilience level post-disasters. AIM: This study aims to determine the degree of environmental change and the capacity of adaptation associate to the levels of community resilience among earthquake victims in Lombok, Indonesia. METHODS: A number of 129 respondents were recruited using clustered random sampling design. Data were collected using the adaptation capacity framework and the resilience brief scale questionnaire by face-to-face interviews. Significant level was set as p = 0.05 with 95% confidence interval. A Chi-square statistical test and logistic regression were used to test hypothesis. RESULTS: A number of 129 respondents included in the study. Bivariate analysis indicated a significant correlation between environmental changed, adaptation capacity, and community resilience. Environmental changed was predictor that statistically significant predicted community resilience (ÃŸ = 2.425, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The level of environmental destruction was significantly predicted the level of community resilience.
