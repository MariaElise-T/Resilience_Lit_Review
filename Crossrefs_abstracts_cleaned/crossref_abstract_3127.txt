At the end of the year 2021, all 4000 resilient houses that are under the project “Improving the resilience of vulnerable coastal communities to climate change-related impacts in Vietnam” were completed. However, the project sponsor and implementor need to be aware of the level of satisfaction of the stakeholders of these resilient houses, especially for local beneficiaries. This study is carried out to answer several practical questions such as what are the strengths and weaknesses of the project house designs, focusing on the basic needs of beneficiaries. Or, are the beneficiaries satisfied with the house constructed with support from the project, and what are their suggestions to improve either the relevant procedures and processes or future houses to be built by the project or other stakeholders. The findings show several aspects of design and construction of resilient houses such as utilization effectiveness, satisfaction of beneficiaries, and participation of local communities. However, several practical limitations of this phase have been identified, namely, the approved designs do not fully reflect the needs of beneficiaries, the designs lack some essential and basic functionalities, some technical shortcomings exist in design drawings, and support funding is limited. On the basis of that, the authors recommended several valuable measures for effective and sustainable designing and constructing resilient houses.
