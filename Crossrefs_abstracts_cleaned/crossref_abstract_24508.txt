Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity. Objective was to determine magnitude of resilience among Grade 10 Sinhala conversant adolescents in state schools of Gampaha district. A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted. Computed final sample size was 1380. All three stages of cluster sampling were conducted applying probability sampling techniques to obtain the final sample. Study instrument comprised 14-Item Resilience Scale-Sinhala version. Magnitude of resilience was described as proportions and expressed as percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Overall resilience score ranged from 15 to 98. The median was 79.00 (IQR: 70.00-86.00). Levels of magnitude were: High 11.6% (n=159; 95%CI=9.9–13.3), Moderately high 29.3% (n=405; 95%CI=27.0-31.8), Moderate 25.5% (n=352; 95%CI=23.2-27.9), Lower end 20.2% (n=279; 95%CI=18.2–22.5), Low 7.8% (n=108; 95%CI=6.4–9.3) and Very low 5.6% (n=77; 95%CI=4.4-6.9). Latter three low levels together comprised one third of the adolescents. Recommend a psycho-behavioral intervention to enhance resilience.
