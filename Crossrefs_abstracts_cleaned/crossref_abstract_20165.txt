The spread of COVID-19 reached pandemic rates in a few weeks. People have turned
to coping and religious coping styles as a result of the psychological effects of COVID-
19. In this context, this studyâ€™s primary purpose is to reveal the relationship between
fear of COVID-19, resilience, coping, and religious coping. In this article, where the
quantitative research method was used, the relational screening design was adopted as the
research design. Collected data were analyzed using correlation and structural equation
modeling. According to the findings, women, single people, people from low-income families, and people with chronic conditions are more afraid of COVID-19. Also, resilience
has been found to play a mediating role in the negative relationship between task-oriented
coping and fear of COVID-19.
