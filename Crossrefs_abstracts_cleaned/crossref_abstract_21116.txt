Background: Structural stigma in the form of discriminatory laws and policies impacts the mental health of sexual and gender minorities, especially with regard to suicidality. However, this relationship could be moderated by resilience. The past two years has brought anti-SGM legislation, particularly transgender sports bans, at the state level in the United States into focus. This study aims to understand if the relationship between familiarity with transgender sports bans (proposed or enacted) and suicidality was moderated by individual or community resilience. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of survey data collected from a national sample of 1033 SGM adults in the United States between 28 January and 7 February 2022. Univariate and multivariate moderation analyses were used. Results: In the univariate analyses and the final model, community resilience moderated the relationship between structural stigma and suicidality (p = 0.0002); however, individual resilience did not (p = 0.0664). Conclusion: Interventions to bolster community resilience may attenuate the negative mental health impacts of structural stigma and are warranted, along with concerted efforts to minimize structural stigma in the form of discriminatory laws and policies targeting people who are SGM.
