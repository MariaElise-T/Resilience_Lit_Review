AbstractThe 2006 Lebanon War exposed children in the north of Israel to daily rocket attacks. To cope with the massive psychological needs, a teacher‐delivered protocol focusing on enhancing personal resilience was implemented. Children were assessed for risk factors, symptoms, and adaptation before the 16‐week program (Time 1; n = 983) and after its completion (Time 2; n = 563). At a 3‐month follow‐up (Time 3; n = 754) children were assessed together with a waiting‐list comparison group (n = 1,152). Participating children showed a significant symptom decrease at Time 2 and significantly fewer symptoms than the control group at Time 3. Six or more risk factors were associated with greater symptoms and parental concern about the child's adaptive functioning. Teachers are valuable cost‐effective providers for clinically informed interventions after mass trauma and disaster.
