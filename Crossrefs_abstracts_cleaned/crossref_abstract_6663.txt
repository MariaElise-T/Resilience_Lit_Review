Over the years, literature on the topic of destination resilience has gained increasing attention in different fields (strategic management; sociology; etc.). Therefore, the potentiality of resilience in the tourism field has stimulated the definition and the implementation of strategies, policies, and activities addressed to mitigate risks and seize opportunities through open innovation attitudes in times of crisis. This work aims to contribute to the debate on tourist destination resilience by proposing a conceptual framework of destination resilience and open innovation based on a bibliometric analysis. Moreover, this article is intended as a starting point for a wider discussion of factors that contribute to destination resilience and therefore provides the basis to develop a toolkit of matrixes and approaches. Findings reveal that resilience assessment, as well as in terms of performance, remain undiscovered. Moreover, the present research poses some unresolved questions, shaping interesting future research directions.
