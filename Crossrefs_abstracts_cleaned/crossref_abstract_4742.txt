This paper deals with the resilient condition that may be reached by driven piles, during its installation as well as under static cyclic and monotonic loading tests. During the 1950’s Van Weele observed its effect in the context of a method for the separation of the toe and shaft loads at failure using the results of static cyclic loading tests on driven piles. Under this condition and based on a mathematical model that uses Cambefort’s Relations and takes into account pile compressibility and residual loads, this paper shows that there is a homothetic relation between the loading and the unloading-movement curves at pile head. A graphical construction is presented along with a numerical procedure allowing to improve the understanding of pile behavior and to determine significant parameters of pile-soil interaction under static or driving loadings. Application of the homothetic relations is made to several piles and particularly a new procedure was developed to analyze dynamic loading tests with a single blow record, considering the residual load at the toe.
