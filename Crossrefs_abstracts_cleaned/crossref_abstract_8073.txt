Abstract
This special issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapy highlights the contribution of occupational therapy practitioners to the care of clients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The case studies and articles exemplify the resilience of practitioners and the importance of occupational therapy interventions in addressing the physical, cognitive, psychological, and social needs of clients, their families, and care providers. We encourage practitioners to be inventive, to be collaborative, and to contribute to research regarding the benefits of occupational therapy for this population.
