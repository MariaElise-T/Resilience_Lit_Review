SignificanceA volcanic ash–lime mortar has been regarded for centuries as the principal material constituent that provides long-term durability to ancient Roman architectural concrete. A reproduction of Imperial-age mortar based on Trajan’s Markets (110 CE) wall concrete resists microcracking through cohesion of calcium–aluminum–silicate–hydrate cementing binder and in situ crystallization of platey strätlingite, a durable calcium-aluminosilicate mineral that reinforces interfacial zones and the cementitious matrix. In the 1,900-y-old mortar dense intergrowths of the platey crystals obstruct crack propagation and preserve cohesion at the micron scale. Trajanic concrete provides a proven prototype for environmentally friendly conglomeratic concretes that contain ∼88 vol % volcanic rock yet maintain their chemical resilience and structural integrity in seismically active environments at the millenial scale.
