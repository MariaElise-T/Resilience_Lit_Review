Abstract
Multi-parameter-path length method for resilience (MP-PLMR) has been proposed to determine the resilience of system multiparameter considerations. It was applied to two engineering situations: (i) Passive catalytic device for hydrogen management in nuclear power plant (NPP) and (ii) Engineered systems for hydrogen mitigation in NPP. The method involves normalizations of the system parameters, the time domain and correlation coefficient across the parameters. The path length for the transient was defined using all the parameters and their correlations. The resilience value in the two case studies depended on the number of parameters considered and correlations. System resilience without the consideration of correlation was also estimated. The difference between the correlated and uncorrelated resilience was significant. While there is no established metric against which the calculated values could be compared, these values can be used to define system effectiveness in conjunction with reliability of systems.
