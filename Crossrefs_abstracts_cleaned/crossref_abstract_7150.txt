PurposeLeadership development has attracted much research attention within the human resource development (HRD) community. However, little scholarly effort has been made to study a special group of leaders â€“ entrepreneurs. This paper aims to fill in this knowledge gap by taking a close look at entrepreneurial resilience, a key ability of entrepreneurs to overcome challenges and adapt to uncertainties.Design/methodology/approachThis paper conducted an extensive literature review using conceptual analysis as the primary method. Enablers and inhibitors affecting entrepreneurial resilience development were identified from the selected empirical studies.FindingsFrom the analysis of empirical studies, a set of enablers and inhibitors was identified, and the effects on entrepreneur resilience were explored. Based on identified enablers and inhibitors, an integrative model of entrepreneurial resilience that serves as a building block for entrepreneurial resilience theory building was proposed.Originality/valueFindings from this research and the newly proposed model will not only contribute to the much-needed entrepreneurial resilience theory building but also serve as a useful guide for human resource professionals and trainers in designing leadership development interventions.
