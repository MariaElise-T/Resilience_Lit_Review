Abstract
Small island states are regarded as the poster children in the resilience of global climate change, while their sustainability varies within individual states considering the complicated interactions of spatially differentiated environmental, economic, and social factors. As the typical case of sea-locked scattering atolls, Kiribati shows its dramatic sustainability variations in different spatial scales. The findings of place-specified questionnaires from Kiribati citizens show that local perspectives on sustainability vary among urban areas, rural areas, as well as remote island areas. The results of the research hopefully provide policy implications for space-specific small island sustainability resilience.
