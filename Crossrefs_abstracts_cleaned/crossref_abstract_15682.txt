The level of resilience is fundamental for victims to be able to live normally as before the disaster came, which is influenced by several factors, one of which is a protective factor. This study aims to determine the relationship between protective factors and community resilience in dealing the flood disaster. This research was conducted in Gempolsari Village, Sidoarjo (East Java, Indonesia). This study used quantitative descriptive as the research design with cross sectional approach. This study used Probability Sampling as sampling technique in the form of Sampling Fraction Per Cluster. The sample used was 91 respondents. This study used two variables: protective factors as independent variables and community resilience to face flood as the dependent variable. The data collection process was carried out using a questionnaire, then data was analyzed using the Spearman Rho test(α≤ 0,05). The results showed that a significant relationship (p= 0.05) between protective factors and the level of community resilience in dealing with flood was found, where the protective factor that has the strongest relationship was impulse control (r= 0.527). A high protective factor could increase the level of community resilience to face flood disasters, because the level of resilience was influenced by the level of protective factors owned by the community.
