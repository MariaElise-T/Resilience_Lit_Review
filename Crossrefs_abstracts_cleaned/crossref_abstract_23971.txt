AbstractExposure to stress can lead to long lasting behavioral and neurobiological consequences, which may enhance the susceptibility for the onset of mental disorders. However, there are significant individual differences in the outcome of stress exposure since only a percentage of exposed individuals may show pathological consequences, whereas others appear to be resilient. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effects of prenatal stress (PNS) exposure in rats at adolescence and to identify subgroup of animals with a differential response to the gestational manipulation. PNS adolescent offspring (regardless of sex) showed impaired emotionality in different pathological domains, such as anhedonia, anxiety, and sociability. However, using cluster analysis of the behavioral data we could identify 70% of PNS-exposed animals as vulnerable (PNS-vul), whereas the remaining 30% were considered resilient (PNS-res). At the molecular level, we found that PNS-res males show a reduced basal activation of the ventral hippocampus whereas other regions, such as amygdala and dorsal hippocampus, show significant PNS-induced changes regardless from vulnerability or resilience. Taken together, our results provide evidence of the variability in the behavioral and neurobiological effects of PNS-exposed offspring at adolescence. While these data may advance our understanding of the association between exposure to stress during gestation and the risk for psychopathology, the investigation of the mechanisms associated to stress vulnerability or resilience may be instrumental to develop novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.
