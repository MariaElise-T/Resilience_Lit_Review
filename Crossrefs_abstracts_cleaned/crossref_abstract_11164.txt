In the last few decades, the frequency and severity of floods in South Asia have vastly increased due to the increase in global surface temperature and change in rainfall patterns. The lack of risk perception, high vulnerability and lack of proper architectural adaptations have added to the negative consequences of disasters. This study discusses the effect of risk perception and vulnerability on flood resilient architecture. The research was conducted with 35 participants selected from the Mudduwa area in Rathnapura, Sri Lanka where the annual flood frequency and damage is very high. The collected data was analyzed using statistical software to calculate a composite mean score to each theoretical factor risk perception, vulnerability, and architectural adaptation. With assumptions, a non-parametric correlation test was carried out to identify the relationship between the three theoretical factors and their subsequent variables. The research findings concluded that risk perception has a positive correlation with architectural adaptation, but vulnerability demonstrates a negative correlation. According to the study, vulnerability acts as a resistance to the correlation between risk perception and architectural adaptation. In conclusion this study elaborates on the importance of a proper system of adaptation for vulnerable people living in flood prone areas.
