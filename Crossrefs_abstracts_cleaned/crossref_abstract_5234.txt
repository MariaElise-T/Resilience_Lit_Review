AbstractThis review paper provides an in-depth analysis of Ã— Tritordeum [(Ascherson et Graebner)], a novel cereal crop with promising agronomic, nutritional, and economic potential. Through a comprehensive examination of the crop's agronomic characteristics and management requirements, we highlight its adaptability to Mediterranean climates, resilience under changing environmental conditions, and potential applications in the food industry, such as breadmaking and pasta production. We also discuss the role of digital agriculture technologies in optimizing tritordeum cultivation and their potential impact on agricultural practices. Furthermore, we assess the opportunities and challenges associated with tritordeum's integration into the agricultural economy and production systems, emphasizing its potential to contribute to a more sustainable and health-conscious food system. By offering a holistic understanding of tritordeum's attributes, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, agronomists, food manufacturers, and policymakers interested in exploring the potential of this innovative cereal grain.
