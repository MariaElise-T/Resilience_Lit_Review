Sexual minorities in China suffer from severe stigma, with more than half of Chinese sexual minorities believing that their families discriminate against them However, research on family and sexual minorities is extremely limited in China. This study focuses on how families increase the stigma and resilience of sexual minorities. Given the high degree of invisibility of sexual minorities in China and the subjective nature of resilience, Case analysis will be used as the method of this study. Based on long-term follow-up, two representative respondents will describe the stigma they have suffered because of their sexual orientation, whether their families support them, and how their families have affected their stigma and resilience. After that, further conclusions are drawn through case reduction and analysis. This study will fill the gap in Chinese academic circles related to family and sexual minorities and open a new field of research on stigmatization and family interaction in China.
