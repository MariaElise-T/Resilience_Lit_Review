The problem in this research is that women access of providing food is limited due to Covid-19 pandemic, insufficient skills and education as well as poverty. The aim is to describe and analyze the capacity of poor women as family head in strengthening food security in the new normal period. The focus of this research is the family head of poor women in the city of Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. The results showed that the resilience of poor women's household heads was hindered by the legal identity they did not have after divorcing from their husbands. A legal identity will provide a foundation for women to access closed opportunities, because poor women do not understand legal identity is a prerequisite for accessing assistance in poverty alleviation programs. Fortunately, these poor women head of households have excellent resilience to maintain food security for their families. Their resilience is currently heavier than the monetary crisis in 1989-1999, because at this time they have to compete with others who are more knowledgeable in information technology. As the recommendations, the results of this study are aimed at the city government of Surakarta to develop a different affirmative strategy to strengthen family food security, especially for poor female household heads.
