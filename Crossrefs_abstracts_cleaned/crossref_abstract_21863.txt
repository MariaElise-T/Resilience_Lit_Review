AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic is an unfolding crisis which is continually testing the resilience of healthcare organisations. In this context, a key requirement for executives, managers and frontline staff is continually adapting, learning and coping with complexity under pressure to deliver high quality and safe care. Sydney Local Health District has responded to the COVID‐19 crisis, in part, through the pivoting of rpavirtual, a newly established virtual health service, to deliver an innovative model of care in a clinically rigorous and safe manner. Through reviewing the rapid evolution of rpavirtual's purpose, implementation challenges and impact, we investigate how it has displayed resilience and derive key lessons for health organisations.
