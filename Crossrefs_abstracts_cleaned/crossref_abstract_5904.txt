Ensuring climate resilience in water management in Central Asia is a critical challenge in today's world. This problem is of interest in connection with its possible impact on the sustainable development of the region. The purpose of this work is to analyze the current state of the rational use of water resources in Central Asia to identify ways to optimize their management. The study used a qualitative and quantitative analysis of data on water use collected from various sources, as well as a comparison method to assess the effectiveness of existing water management practices in the region. The authors revealed that the unbalanced distribution and inefficient use of water resources in Central Asia led to environmental and socio-economic problems.
