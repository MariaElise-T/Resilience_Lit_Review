 The problem of [Formula: see text] control is investigated for turbofan systems with uncertain parameters and multiple disturbances in this paper. Some disturbances with partly known information are described via an external system, and other disturbances are assumed to be [Formula: see text] norm bounded. According to the disturbance-observer-based-control (DOBC) method and resilient [Formula: see text] control technique, a robust resilient controller is designed to reject and attenuate the influence of these disturbances, and guarantees that closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable with [Formula: see text] performance. Some solvable sufficient conditions are obtained based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation is presented to show the robustness and effectiveness of the developed resilient anti-disturbance [Formula: see text] control method.
