Abstract
Resilience integrates the relationship between mitigation, adaptation and innovation processes. Resilience is also closely related to the strength of social capital of a community. In Indonesia, strong social capital is found in a social community of kampung kota. Social capital is also related to the livelihoods theory approach. Livelihoods also view that a community has social capital that can overcome threats and pressures. So the two approaches have the same object of study, namely the ability of social capital to deal with threats and pressures. This study aims to find out how the concept of resilience and livelihoods can explaining social capital that is formed in kampung kota communities. This study uses a case-study methodology by conducting exploration using in-depth interviewing techniques from important various sources. Kampung Laweyan is a traditional batik village that has passed the ups and downs to be able to survive until now. Meanwhile, Kampung Sudiroprajan was a Chinatown village that had faced social conflict. Finally, this study found a close theory that could complement each other on how resilience and livelihoods could explain social capital in kampung kota. Resilience is a more effective approach to process while livelihood is a more focused approach to actors.
