 Resilience can be conceptualized as a network of interacting mental-health constructs characterized by weak autoconnections and/or interconnections. We investigated whether positive appraisal style (PAS), the ability to bounce back or recover from stress (BRS), age, education level, and urbanization grade can confer such desirable network properties within a network comprising depression, anxiety, loneliness, and mental well-being. Longitudinal data (five time points during the COVID-19 pandemic) were derived from a sample of older adults ( N = 1,270, 55+). Individuals who were 67 or older, highly educated, or scored high on PAS and BRS exhibited more resilient network dynamics and generally better overall mental-health outcomes. Findings pertaining to urbanization grade and the (subgroup-dependent) dynamics among the mental-health constructs are also discussed. These findings may inform theorizing and interventions aimed at resilience during a challenging life phase.
