The present study aimed to scrutinize the impact of punitive supervision on turnover intention in the presence of the mediating role of stress and moderating role of resilience. This study contributed to the literature by linking the relationship of variables with the leadermember exchange theory. Using a questionnaire survey approach, responses from private hospitals were gathered. 342 nurses working at private hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan, provided the data. Data analysis in SPSS was carried out using Process Macro. Descriptive statistics tests, correlations, mediation, and moderation were used for the data analysis. The findings of the present study demonstrated a significant connection between punitive supervision and the intention to leave oneâ€™s job. The literature evaluation that was done for this study lends further credence to this theory. This study also shows a favorable relationship between punitive supervision and job stress. Additionally, job stress has a strong and positive relationship with the intention to leave. Based on both direct and indirect impact data, it is possible to infer that the relationship between punitive supervision and the intent to leave the work mediates job stress. The discussion includes practical implications, limitations, and recommendations for further study. Future study is advised to take into account time-lag studies with a sizable data set and additional dimension.
