 This study examined the development of resilience in Japanese adults using a two-wave latent change model with 1284 Japanese adults (865 men, aged 20–69 years). The Bidimensional Resilience Scale was administered at both waves over a 2-year interval: January 2017 (Time 1) and January 2019 (Time 2). The results showed no significant mean-level change between Time 1 and Time 2, and relatively high stability. The latent change model indicated that changes in resilience varied significantly among individuals; however, sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with variations in resilience. Resilience appears relatively stable in Japanese adults, despite individual variation.
