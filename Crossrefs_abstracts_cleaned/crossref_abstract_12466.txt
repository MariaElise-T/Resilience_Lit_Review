Abstract
Transportation system plays a vital role in sustaining the economic and social well-being of a community. Disaster or extreme hazard such as earthquake, storms, landslide, flood, terrorism, etc. has a major impact on the resilience of the road, especially in ensuring the impact toward the recovery for communities. Road infrastructure is linked to many encompassing factors such as road user, climate, economy, material, topography and periodic maintenance. Recently, unpredicted climate causes heavy rain, landslide, and flood resulting in high losses bared by the government on the repair and reconstruction works. Previous events have revealed that certain road areas in Malaysia are vulnerable after exposed to damage due to the natural disaster. This paper highlights the identified factors that contribute to adaptation on the escape route for road disaster resilient. A comprehensive review was done to identify a few missing approaches in the road network resiliency, which include a temporal route option as part of the adaptive routing solution. The research is expected to become a reference to overcome disruption in the road network in time of disaster or crisis while supporting the government initiative to strengthen the resilience of the nationâ€™s infrastructure.
