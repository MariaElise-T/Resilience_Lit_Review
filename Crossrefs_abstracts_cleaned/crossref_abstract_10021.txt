Abstract
The Trans-Volga Lithuanian diaspora has for more than 150 years traversed the challenges of assimilation into a majoritarian Russian society. However, in the contemporary era, the third- and fourth-generation descendants’ resilience to assimilation is focused on sensitivity to roots and a valorisation of the diasporic past. The role of agency in diasporic memory, place-making and cultural representations is of key importance. The aim of this paper is to focus on the post-diasporic domains of communality by highlighting the shared values and aspirations, strategies and experiences of the reclamation and heritagisation of diasporic legacy. Analysis of fieldwork among the descendants has shown that their resilience to assimilation is grounded in the dominant narrative of the heroic past of the diaspora firstcomers: in terms of—Lithuanians as pioneers of the Kazakh steppe; in the heritagisation of Lithuanian objects and places via collection and museumisation of ethnographic objects, and co-memorising; the re-Lithuanianisation of diaspora places through erecting Catholic chapels and crosses; and in the festive representations of traditional Trans-Volga Lithuanian culture at state-sponsored local multicultural festivals.
