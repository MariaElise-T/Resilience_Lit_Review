   ABSTRACT   Objectives: Although experiences of burnout are well documented among some health professionals, there is limited research that explores similar experiences among dietitians. This study aims (1) to describe the varied qualitative dimensions of burnout that are particular to dietitians and (2) to identify the factors that might be deemed protective against burnout. Methods: Fourteen dietitians were recruited from a larger quantitative study that assessed prevalence of burnout in Ontario, Canada using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Those who completed the MBI were invited to participate in two phenomenological interviews. Transcribed interviews were analyzed by naïve readings and identified meaning units with a larger team for increased rigor and trustworthiness. Results: Dietitians describe burnout as having bodily and overall health consequences. Both social/professional relationships and dietitians’ passion for their work contributed to experiences of burnout and resilience. Opportunities for continued professional growth and change were contributing factors for resilience. Implications & Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge on dietitians’ lived experiences of burnout and resilience. The findings have implications for those involved in the education and training of student dietitians, and for those in a position to offer support to dietitians who are struggling with job stress. In the context of fostering resilience, a preventative approach to dietetic education is explored with the intention to protect future practitioners from burnout.
