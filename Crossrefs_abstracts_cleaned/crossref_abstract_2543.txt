Resilient clip technology is an alternative to resilient channel for supporting gypsum wallboard in fire rated wall and floor-ceiling assemblies. Lightweight wood frame construction presents challenges in meeting building code requirements for impact insulation class (IIC) and sound transmission class (STC) ratings in floor-ceiling assemblies. Through laboratory testing we were able to compare different floor-ceiling assemblies commonly used in multi-family construction. Two different structures were tested, an 18 in. open web truss, 24 in. o.c., and a 12 in. engineered joist (TJI) 24 in. o.c. Various finish floor coverings were used including ceramic tile, vinyl, and engineered wood. Structures achieved minimum IIC and STC 50 with and without 3/4 in. Gypsum concrete. Resilient rubber underlayment of varying thickness can further improve the IIC and STC ratings of the assembly as can adding a second layer of gypsum wallboard.
