The focus of this research is to identify the dynamics of regional economic development through digital trends towards tourist visits and the promotion of tourist destinations in the Lake Toba area during the F1 Powerboat World Championship (F1H2O) event on Lake Toba, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Through the conduct of online research methods (ORMs) in diagnosing digital social issues and trends regarding the events, the results show that there was an effort to maximize the increase in regional economic development, by utilizing the potential and attractiveness of holding the F1 Powerboat as part of sports tourism. As an event aims to spur the movement of domestic tourists to super-priority destination areas, the implementation of the F1 Powerboat event is not only a driving force in the recovery and improvement of the local economy after the COVID-19 Pandemic, but also a venue for the promotion of other tourist destinations in North Sumatra. However, the positive impacts of this event organization on sustainable economic growth in the surrounding areas is not without reservations. The event has received some negative feedback, which include the problems of event preparation and implementation, and also the limited awareness of local community tourism. This research suggests that in order to achieve sustainable regional development and urban resilience, the future organization of sport tourism events should not only focus on the economic objectives, but also on the other aspects including socio-cultural and environmental perspectives.
