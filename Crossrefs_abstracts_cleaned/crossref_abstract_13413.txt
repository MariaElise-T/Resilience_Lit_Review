High degree of resilience has been described as an enduring positive view of life despite difficult circumstances during the aging process. How to become old and being old with low resilience have not been studied. The aim of this study was to illuminate experiences about becoming old and being old among very old people with low resilience. Interviews from very old women and men were analyzed using content analysis with the following themes identified: being out of it, emphasizing life experiences from the past, religiousdoubting, and accepting age. Except for religious doubting, the themes contained both similarities and variations between women and men. Our study showed that in spite of scoring low on the Resilience Scale (RS), very old persons can experience integration and well-being. However, the women seemed to be more vulnerable compared to men, and for them, it is important to strengthen social and relational possibilities for contributing to resilience.
