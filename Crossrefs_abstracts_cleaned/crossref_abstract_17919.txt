 This study aimed to clarify the role that career resilience plays in preventing inhibition of career development when individuals confront changes during their working life, such as changes in work tasks or health condition. Career resilience consists of five factors: ability to cope with problems, social skills, interest in novelty, optimism about the future, and willingness to help others. In all, 1,000 Japanese company employees completed an online survey. The results showed that optimism about the future and ability to cope with problems exhibited a negative correlation with NPC when confronting changes. The results of simple slope analysis suggested that social skills and ability to cope with problems decreased the negative influence that psychological symptoms caused by changes had on job satisfaction, which was one index of career development. This study underlines the necessity of developing the ability to cope with problems and social skills.
