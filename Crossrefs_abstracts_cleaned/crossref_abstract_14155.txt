AbstractAlthough academic resilience is of great concern to contemporary educational practitioners, there is no consensus on its measurement. Furthermore, protective factors characterized by East Asian societal contexts remain ambiguous. This systematic review aims to offer an overview of the operational definitions, statistical methodology, and protective factors of academic resilience identified in East Asian countries/economies. With a focus on large‐scale assessment (LSA) research, three databases (i.e., Web of Science, CNKI, and AiritiLibary) were searched and returned 31 peer‐reviewed studies over the last decade. Results indicated that the definition‐driven method was commonly adopted in international LSA studies (e.g., Programme for the International Student Assessment) to measure academic resilience, and the research conducted in national/regional LSA (e.g., China Education Panel Survey) tended to use the process‐driven approach. Logistic regression was the most frequently data analysis technique utilized in the definition‐driven approach, while structural equation modeling and mediation/moderation analyses accounted for the largest proportion of the process‐driven methods. Our study shed light on the methodological issues of academic resilience in LSA. Additionally, it highlights the aspiration of educational researchers to identify Asian‐specific protective factors from the social‐ecological perspective to propose appropriate interventions fostering academic resilience.
