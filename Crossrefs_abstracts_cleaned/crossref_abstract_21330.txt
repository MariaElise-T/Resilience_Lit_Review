ABSTRACT
Microbial interactions contribute significantly to coral health in the marine environment. Most beneficial associations have been described with their bacterial communities, but knowledge of beneficial associations between protozoan ciliates and corals is still lacking. Ciliates are important bacterial predators and provide nutrition to higher trophic-level organisms. The mucus secreted by corals and the microenvironment of the coral surface layer attract ciliates based on their food preferences. The mixotrophic and heterotrophic ciliates play a major role in nutrient cycling by increasing nitrogen, phosphorus, and extractable sulfur, which can enhance the proliferation of coral beneficial microbe. Besides, bacterial predator ciliates reduce the pathogenic bacterial population that infects the coral and also act as bioindicators for assessing the toxicity of the reef ecosystem. Thus, these ciliates can be used as a beneficial partner in influencing coral health and resilience under various stress conditions. Herein, we explore the urgent need to understand the complex beneficial interactions of ciliates that may occur in the coral reef ecosystem.
