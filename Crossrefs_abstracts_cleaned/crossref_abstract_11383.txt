In recent years, with the increasing impact of extreme weather events on energy security, energy vulnerability has increased significantly, and more and more international institutions and departments have begun to incorporate resilience governance into energy security. This paper focuses on China’s inter-provincial energy security assessment. Compared with existing relevant research, the significant features of our work are (i) introducing the concept of energy resilience and presenting its evolution mechanism and evaluation criteria, (ii) developing a gray relational projection model by using the level difference maximization and optimization theory, (iii) measuring the energy resilience of 30 Chinese provinces over space and time. Our results show that the spatial–temporal patterns of energy resilience in China changed significantly from 2005 to 2018. High energy resilience moved from provinces with abundant nonrenewable energy before 2010 to provinces with high energy diversity. Energy endowment is a primary condition to ensure a region’s energy resilience. Renewable energy development, energy investment, economic development, and policy coordination play vital roles in ensuring regional energy resilience. Energy investment and economic development can effectively improve the energy resilience of resource-poor areas. This study’s results will serve as a reference for China and contribute to expanding knowledge in this field.
