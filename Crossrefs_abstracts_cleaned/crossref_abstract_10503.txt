The current study focused on the impact of meaningful work on employee identity with a mediating role for employee resilience. Data was collected from a sample of 154 employees currently working in the service sector (call centers) of Lahore, Pakistan. The study was quantitative and the data was analyzed using AMOS software. For this purpose, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to check the model fit statistics and the mediation effect of employee resilience was analyzed using Preacher and Hayes’ (2004) median analysis. Convergent validity was measured through factor loading and AVE value verification of indices; whereas reliability was approved through Cronbach’s alpha. The findings of the current study revealed that meaningful work plays a significant role in enhancing employee resilience, which enables them to cope with challenging situations and thus maintaining their identity. In the service sector, where employees continuously deal with customers, resilience becomes the key to attract and retain potential customers, which allows them to deliver exceptional client service with confidence. This research is among a limited number of studies available on this topic and it will be an important addition to research literature highlighting the impact of meaningful work and employee resilience on employee performance in the context of call centers employees working in Lahore, Pakistan.
