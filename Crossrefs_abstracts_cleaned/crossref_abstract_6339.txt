Abstract

Objectives
Resilience is a complex concept that is extensively drawn upon in higher education, nursing included. The objective is to examine the concept of resilience and its use within nursing education.


Methods
Rodgers’ evolutionary concept analysis was used to explore this concept.


Results
The current focus on fostering resilience in undergraduate nursing education predominantly focuses on educational interventions to support one’s ability to self-care continues to be pervasive within the nursing literature. More recent dialogue encourages a more holistic approach that examine interventions from both individual and structural perspectives.


Conclusions
Recommendations for future research are to examine the synergy between individual, contextual, and structural factors to support resilience in nursing students.


Implications for International Audience
Based on the concept analysis, resilience is contextual. Therefore, nurse educators may support and foster nursing students’ resilience by having increased awareness of both individual and structural perspectives of resilience.
