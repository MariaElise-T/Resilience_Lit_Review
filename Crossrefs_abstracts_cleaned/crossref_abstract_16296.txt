Abstract
This research explores how central-city shopping districts could be transformed to support a post-Covid lifestyle, where people re-embrace community, local streets and walking while relying more on online shopping. By reviewing metropolitan/city development plans since the 1980s and mapping changes of retail provisions, urban environment and pedestrian movements in Melbourneâ€™s Hoddle Grid in the twenty-first century, this paper shows that planning policies focusing on people-centred experiences in the central-city shopping district helped to improve retail resilience. This paper thus adds insights to understanding the relentless retail landscape changes and has implications for central-city retail planning in the post-Covid era.
