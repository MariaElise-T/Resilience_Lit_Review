            The widespread use of antibiotics has placed bacterial pathogens under intense pressure to evolve new survival mechanisms. Genomic analysis of 51,229
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis
            (
            Mtb
            )
            
            clinical isolates has identified an essential transcriptional regulator,
            Rv1830
            , herein called
            resR
            for resilience regulator, as a frequent target of positive (adaptive) selection.
            resR
            mutants do not show canonical drug resistance or drug tolerance but instead shorten the post-antibiotic effect, meaning that they enable
            Mtb
            to resume growth after drug exposure substantially faster than wild-type strains. We refer to this phenotype as antibiotic resilience. ResR acts in a regulatory cascade with other transcription factors controlling cell growth and division, which are also under positive selection in clinical isolates of
            Mtb
            . Mutations of these genes are associated with treatment failure and the acquisition of canonical drug resistance.
