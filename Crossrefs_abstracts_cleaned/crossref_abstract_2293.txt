Resilience and exercise dependence are constructs studied in the athlete at different sport levels. The aim of this study is to know risk exercise dependence and resilience prevalence in athletes; analyze the differences according to sex and sport level (amateur / elite). Also, analyze relationship. 387 athletes of different modalities were evaluated, 281 males and 106 females (age: M = 20.10, SD = 4.2). Spanish version of the Dependency Scale of the Revised Exercise (EDS-R; & Gonz√°lez, 2011) and the Resilience Scale (Ruiz, De la Vega, Poveda, Rosado, & Serpa, 2012, adaptation of Wagnild & Young, 1993) adapted to Spanish were administered. The results showed that 8.3% had exercise dependence risk, and 24.8% high resilience. Taking into account sex and sporting level, no differences are observed in the applied scales, although in some of its dimensions. Women and the elite have more personal competence (self-confidence, independence, decision, invincibility, power, ingenuity and perseverance); and men and amateurs a reduction of other activities unrelated to physical exercise and a practice for longer than is generally planned. A reduced significant association between the risk exercise dependence and resilience in athletes appears (r = .14). It is suggested that intervention programs to improve the resilient profile of athletes should be evaluated, and if necessary prevent exercise dependence associated, with characteristics sensitive to adjacent psychological problems.
