AbstractThe speed of change is increasing at a dynamic pace particularly in the field of information science. While the speed of change is not a variable that can be manipulated, we can begin to harness knowledge management processes and theories to better embrace change and build an information‐resilient society to recover from the damage caused by public crises. The panelists discuss the challenges that the society is facing during a public crisis and the KM needs in the crisis scenarios. Then interact with the audiences to share their thoughts and explore possible knowledge management strategies in an information‐resilient society.
