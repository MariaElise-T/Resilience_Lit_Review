Abstract
The aim of the paper is to make an overview of standard windows system used in Slovak Republic. The investigation of the most common traditional wooden window is presented in this paper as a representative sample. These parts of building facades are the most vulnerable areas due to dynamic impact loads. Identification of the basic materials behavior is necessary for effective design of window system resilience. This research is divided to analysis of mechanical properties of components, their connections and boundary conditions. Research in this specific area helps to improve safety against unexpected extreme dynamic load such as explosions and shock impacts.
