SummaryAlthough intra‐oral‐setting resilient denture liners have been used for 30 years to treat the severely resorbed residual ridges of elderly patients, their clinical physical properties are not well understood.The effect of clinical usage on the compliance (compressibility, flexibility) of two intra‐oral‐setting resilient denture liners was measured in 10 patients, for up to 30 days. The clinical compliance of Material B (Coe‐Comfort®) was found to be significantly greater than Material A (Veltec®) for up to 14 days. At 24 h both materials had significant compliance reductions from the original 1 h measurement. These compliance reductions continued throughout the testing period. For up to 14 days of clinical usage there were no significant differences between the compliance reductions of the two materials. The study suggests that (i) Material B would provide more effective tissue conditioning of abused residual ridge mucosa than Material A; and (ii) a functional impression made with these materials should be left in the mouth for at least 24 h before the cast is poured.
