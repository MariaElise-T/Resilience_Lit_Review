Psychological resilience (PR) plays an important role in fortifying mental health during pandemics. This study aimed to examine the PR and its related factors of college students in China after the deblocking of the China’s COVID-19 pandemic strategy. A total of 1100 college students from 15 universities participated in this cross-sectional survey by multi-stage stratified sampling. Data were collected by self-designed socio-demographic information, the family function assessment scale (APGAR), a general health questionnaire (GHQ-12), the general self-efficacy scale (GSES), and a psychological resilience scale. The average score of PR was 135.65 ± 18.54. Cluster analysis of PR scores showed that 24.9% of the college students had weak PR. The higher PR, the higher mental health status (r = 0.352, p < 0.05). Females had higher PR than males (OR = 0.550, 95% CI: 0.367–0.827). High self-efficacy was an independent protective factor of high PR (OR = 0.093, 95% CI: 0.059–0.145). Low family contact frequency, poor family function, and bad mental health status were the independent risk factors of high PR. In conclusion, the PR of Chinese college students were insufficient after the deblocking of China’s COVID-19 pandemic strategy, indicating an improvement of PR should be put into practice immediately. Frequent monthly contact with family, family function, self-efficacy, mental health status, and gender were the influencing factors of PR, which provides an intervention strategy for the future.
