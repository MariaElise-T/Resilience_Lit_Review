 The subject of this article is to propose novel resilient control strategies for switched systems in conditions of input delay and cyber-attacks. At first it is assumed that the attacker can access the sensor of the system and consequently injects unknown false data to the sensor. Next, it is assumed that attacker can access the control block channel and consequently injects unknown nonlinear false data to the controller and also simultaneously can access the actuator, resulting in the loss of effectiveness of the actuator. In such conditions, novel resilient control strategies are proposed to keep the performance of the attacked system up to a reasonable security bound. To achieve resilience in such conditions, Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii functional method is applied to show the uniformly ultimately bounded behavior of the system. Finally, for an evaluating approach, two illustrative examples will be solved.
