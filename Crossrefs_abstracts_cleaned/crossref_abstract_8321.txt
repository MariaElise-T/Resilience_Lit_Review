Abstract
Family resilience is not the sum of the individual psychological resilience of each of the family members, but the family itself as a unit of resilience research. The representative models of family stress tolerance theory mainly include McCubbin’s series of family stress tolerance models and Walsh’s family stress tolerance framework, which are widely used in the practice of family therapy. In the future, empirical studies on family resilience should be strengthened, measurement tools with high reliability and validity should be established, and the combination of family resilience theory and community-based practice should be promoted.
