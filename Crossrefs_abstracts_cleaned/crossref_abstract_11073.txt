In the context of green, low-carbon, and sustainable construction, the safety management of smart construction sites has been a key issue. Current related research mainly focuses on the application of technology, but lacks methods to evaluate the safety management level. Therefore, this research aims to construct a smart construction site safety management evaluation model from a resilience perspective. First, this research identified and screened the indicators initially based on the 4R resilience characteristics and 4M theory by analyzing the policy texts of smart construction site safety management. Then, through expert consultation, the ISM model of resilience indicators was established to determine the evaluation indicator system of smart construction site safety management. Next, the weight of each indicator was determined with the help of the analytic network process, and the evaluation criteria of the indicators were formulated according to the existing specifications and expert interviews; then, the evaluation model of smart construction site safety management was established. Finally, the feasibility of the model was proved through a case study. The findings of the research show that in terms of weights, management has the highest score, followed by media, man, and machine. However, more resilience measures are used for the safety management of machine than the other three in policy texts. Obviously, there is a deviation between weights and resilience characteristics. These findings help reveal the current situation of safety management at smart construction sites, which is of great significance for improving resilience. The findings also help smart construction sites to realize the upgrading of safety, efficiency, and greenness, and promote the sustainable development of smart construction sites as well as the construction industry.
