 The effect of adding bottom ash to medium-plasticity clay as a soil stabilizer was evaluated in this study by performing triaxial resilient modulus tests. Two log–log resilient modulus prediction equations found in the literature (MEPDG and NCHRP 1-28) were selected and calibrated for mixtures of bottom ash and clay at different moisture contents. It was found that, with 25% bottom ash in the mixture, the resilient modulus increased between 5% and 23% under different stress states. The soil total and matric suctions of the mixtures were indirectly measured using the filter paper method, and the total suction parameter was incorporated in the two log–log prediction models. The nonlinear regression analysis revealed that the average goodness-of-fit statistics for one of the modified models showed highly satisfactory performance in predicting the resilient modulus values.
