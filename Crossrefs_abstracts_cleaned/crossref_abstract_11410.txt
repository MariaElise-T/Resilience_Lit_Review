Purpose
This study aims to explore the effects of consumer resilience and brand familiarity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and consumer attitudes toward the company conducting CSR in places that have suffered from traumatic events such as natural or anthropogenic disasters and uncertainty of public health issue.


Design/methodology/approach
This study collected survey-based data from 194 participants who suffered from natural and anthropogenic disasters in the state of Texas. Path analysis was used to test each structural relationship among variables after verifying the reliability and validity of each variable. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the difference in resilience between the two groups.


Findings
This study verified that there is a positive relationship between CSR and consumer attitude. More importantly, the results show that both resilience and familiarity play an important role as a mediator in the relationship between CSR and attitudes. In particular, it tells us that a group with high resilience shows a higher possibility of having positive attitudes toward the company than another group having low resilience.


Originality/value
This study empirically tested the impacts of CSR, resilience and brand familiarity on building consumer attitudes. Furthermore, this study explored the effects of resilience and brand familiarity on the relationship between CSR and attitudes. Thus, this study was able to contribute to understanding the effects of CSR, resilience and familiarity on building a positive attitude in the specific settings, in terms of traumatic events, theoretically and practically.
