There are perhaps not better times than those we are living in, to reconsider how practices and approaches to event innovation, and resilience may help us to chart a path to a more sustainable  industry and societal practice for now and for the future. The impacts the COVID-19
 pandemic has had on the events sector globally and nationally have certainly been profound (see, e. g., OECD, 2021; Stewart et al., 2022). Yet, while these impacts remain to be fully unpicked, continued heightened economic and sociocultural instabilities remind us that the pathway to events'
 success (or failure) lies on the sector's capacity to rethink  current approaches and practices to event planning, delivering, and managing as well as build on innovative stances with an aim of strengthening the sector's capacity and resilience in the face of externalities.
 It is with this in mind that this special issue set out to explore event innovation and resilience during uncertainty, a topic and area of investigation highly relevant to both industry and academia. The special issue offers eight unique research articles and three invited thought pieces
 from leading academics, which are sure to be a valuable reference
