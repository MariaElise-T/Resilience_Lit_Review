The yield of a pasture is directly proportional to the amount of light plants intercept and allocate to different organs. When plants are carbon (C) limited, due to defoliation, they allocate more C preferentially to shoots to restore leaf area. In contrast, water and nitrogen (N) limitations lead to a greater allocation of C to roots. Changes in the root:shoot ratio therefore reflect changes in C and N partitioning and indicate their relative priority. A major factor that influences plant responses to stress is their ability to store and remobilise reserves to restore leaf area. Species with tap roots, like lucerne, have a large potential C and N storage capacity that is utilised seasonally for storage and remobilisation. This has been used to develop seasonally based grazing management rules. Similarly, recommendations to graze perennial ryegrass at the 2- or 3-leaf stage are based on the balance between maximizing growth rates and the need to replenish water-soluble carbohydrate reserves. However, perennial ryegrass has lower levels of perennial reserves than other grass species. This reduces its resilience to concurrent water deficits or N deficiency. Under these conditions maintaining the recommended 3-leaf grazing intervals and/or leaving higher post-grazing pasture masses are recommended to assist canopy recovery. Other grass species, such as cocksfoot and tall fescue, provide more resilience, particularly in response to water deficits.
