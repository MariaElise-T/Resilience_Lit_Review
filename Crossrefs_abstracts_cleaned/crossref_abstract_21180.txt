Objective. Report the prevalence of depression, resilience, and risk factors among healthcare workers (HCW) during Co­vid-19. Materials and methods. This is an observational cross-sectional study derived from the ongoing international, prospective multicentric study “The COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrk­Ers Study” (HEROES). A convenience sample of 2 127 HCW was obtained from Chiapas and Jalisco between May 19th and July 24th 2020. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, resilience with the Brief Resilience Scale and a Covid risk scale was developed. Model-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and an additive interaction model were performed. Results. Moderate-severe depression was found in 16.6% of HCW. Those from Jalisco, physicians, in hospitals, with chronic illness and mental health history were more depressed. The interaction between resilience and risk showed that, compared to those with no risk and medium/high resilience, HCW at risk with medium/high resilience had a 2.38 PR for depression while those at risk and low resilience had a PR of 5.83. Conclusion. This evidence points the need to develop strategies to enhance resilience and reduce the risk in HCW.
