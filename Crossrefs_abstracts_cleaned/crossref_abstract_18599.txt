 In this paper, the challenges associated with controlling the Internet of connected vehicle (IOCV) system and mitigating the limited network communication bandwidth under the threat of denial-of-service (DoS) and deception attacks are addressed. To tackle these challenges, we present a centralized third-order model that better aligns with the dynamics of vehicles and design a resilient adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) that incorporates countermeasures against cyber-attacks. Based on this mechanism, we propose a security controller to ensure the security state of the IOCV system. Utilizing the Lyapunov theory, we rigorously prove that the system is ultimately uniformly bounded and string stable. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, which demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing the issues under consideration.
