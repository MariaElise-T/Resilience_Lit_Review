Maintaining information that documents damages that natural disasters cause to infrastructure and documenting the efforts to rebuild it, is essential for future infrastructure mitigation and reconstruction actions. To address this, we have developed the Interdisciplinary Research Network Extension (IReNE) aimed to keep record and centralize data relevant to cases in Puerto Rico. IReNE has been conceptualized following the case study methodology and it has been designed to fit and scaffold the Resilient Infrastructure and Sustainability Education â€“ Undergraduate Program (RISE-UP), following the four stages defined by the Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model and a Project Based Learning approach. This paper presents the development of IReNE and presents case study examples of its current use for supporting the RISE-UP teaching model. IReNE was designed as an open-source platform that will be timely available to researchers, academics, and practitioners. We also expect their conceptual and applied developments to be replicated in other academic contexts, and therefore contributing on documenting, systematizing, and disseminating the impact of natural events on infrastructure.
