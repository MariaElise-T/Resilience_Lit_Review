Background:
Health care professionals face high levels of stress from working in a demanding environment. Resiliency training has emerged as an approach to overcome occupational stress. The purpose of this study was to understand what is known about educational strategies for teaching resilience.


Method:
The five-stage approach from Arksey and O'Malley was used as the methodological framework. Resources were evaluated thematically to identify key strategies and interventions.


Results:

              Included resources (
              N
              = 25) were organized into six themes: (a) Reflective Practice; (b) Storytelling; (c) Peer Support and Mentoring; (d) Professional Support and Mentoring; (e) Mindfulness and Meditation Practice; and (f) Enhancing Self-Knowledge and Personal Competencies.
            


Conclusion:

              This scoping review has confirmed that there are relevant education strategies to assist students in developing resilience. Recommendations for integrating resilience education at the undergraduate level are included. Preparing nursing students to persevere through adversities is essential for maintaining physical, mental, and emotional health throughout their career.
