We experimentally demonstrate a 4-Gbit/s 16-QAM pilot-assisted, self-coherent, and turbulence-resilient free-space optical link using a photodetector (PD) array. The turbulence resilience is enabled by the efficient optoelectronic mixing of the data and pilot beams in a free-space-coupled receiver, which can automatically compensate for turbulence-induced modal coupling to recover the data’s amplitude and phase. For this approach, a sufficient PD area might be needed to collect the beams while the bandwidth of a single larger PD could be limited. In this work, we use an array of smaller PDs instead of a single larger PD to overcome the beam collection and bandwidth response trade-off. In the PD-array-based receiver, the data and pilot beams are efficiently mixed in the aggregated PD area formed by four PDs, and the four mixing outputs are electrically combined for data recovery. The results show that: (i) either with or without turbulence effects (
