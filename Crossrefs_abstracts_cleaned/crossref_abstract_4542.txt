Aims:The project aimed to explore how the system (e.g. the work environment and role) affects staff resilience and how the system could support staff resilience.Background:Understanding factors impacting staff resilience and how staff can be supported is seen as important for improving staff wellbeing, increasing job satisfaction, staff retention and recruitment.Methods:Fifteen female participants working as staff members on a dementia ward were recruited to complete a qualitative questionnaire about their resilience. All participants were of working age. Responses were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Seven themes were identified from their responses as affecting resilience; staffing issues, staff stress, lack of support, not being listened to, not being valued, communication and feeling at risk. Staff also provided ideas for positive change and support that has previously been helpful which formed two additional themes. Recommendations and conclusions: Staff resilience was affected by different aspects of the system. Feedback suggested support that could be put in place to improve resilience such as drop-in sessions, debrief sessions and improved communication.
