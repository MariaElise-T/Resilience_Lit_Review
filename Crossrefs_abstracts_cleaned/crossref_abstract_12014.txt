Social distancing measures can create psychological issues, especially among hospital staff who constantly deal with emergency patients. To explore the mediating role of COVID-19 anxiety on the association between COVID-19 safety protocols and mental health, and to test the moderating role of resilience between COVID-19 safety protocols and COVID-19 anxiety, this work collected data on hospital staff in terms of COVID-19 safety protocols, psychological resilience, COVID-19 anxiety, and improving staff mental health. The effects of the use of COVID-19 safety protocols on COVID-19 anxiety and the mental health of hospital workers in China were also analyzed. The experimental results showed that resilience remarkably moderated COVID-19 safety protocols and COVID-19 anxiety among Chinese hospital staff.
