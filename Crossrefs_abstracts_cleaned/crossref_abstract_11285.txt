Cancer is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Korea. However, there has been no previous nursing literature review on the phenomenon of resilience among cancer patients in Korea. The purpose of this study was to identify information about theories, instruments, correlates, and outcomes of resilience in the cancer experiences of Korean adults. This was a scoping review that searched Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, DBpia, and the Korean Studies Information Service System between 2000 and 2016 in order to identify English and Korean research reports. The review yielded 17 quantitative studies, including 2 resilience theories and 6 resilience-specific instruments. The factors self-efficacy, hope, social supports, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression were associated with resilience, regardless of the type of cancer. Quality of life and coping were commonly investigated outcome variables for resilience. This review suggests that a nursing theory reflecting Korean culture and qualitative research concerning the phenomenon of resilience should be conducted as research priorities as the foundation for developing culturally appropriate tools for resilience. This will lead to enhanced quality of life among Korean cancer patients, which is the core of palliative nursing care.
