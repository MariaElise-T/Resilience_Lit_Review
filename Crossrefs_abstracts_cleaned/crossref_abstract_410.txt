Climate change has become a global burden that any country should not take lightly. Several studies have already been undertaken on this subject; however, there is still no consensus on its definition and measurement method. This study examines the concept of climate resilience and identifies six variables as critical components that will aid in determining where the country requires additional reinforcement to be climate-resilient. This study utilized principal components analysis to reduce six variables to a single component. Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Singapore, and Denmark are more climate-resilient than the rest of the globe, evidenced by their high gross domestic product, ease of doing business, governance readiness, and social readiness. On the other hand, Zimbabwe is one of the least climate-resilient due to its poor governance and social readiness and its high vulnerability.
