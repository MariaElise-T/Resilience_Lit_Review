 The Covid-19 crisis has placed non-profit organizations in a new operational, human, financial, and economic situation. In France, “associations” (grassroots volunteer organizations, as specific NPOs) have experienced three lockdowns and numerous restrictive measures. The study of their resilience is therefore necessary, and contributes to the knowledge of the concept. A large-scale survey of 10,926 NPO leaders showed that French organizations are still suffering one year after the crisis began. Their recovery is still difficult and their dependence on their resource-providing stakeholders disadvantages them. A cubic analytical framework is also proposed to synthesize the research dedicated to non-profit resilience.
