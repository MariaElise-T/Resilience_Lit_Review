Introduction: Given the importance of academic resilience in students' academic life, the aim of this study was the validity and reliability of the academic resilience scale in undergraduate students of Ahvaz universities.
Methods: in this descriptive psychometric study, the number of 306 undergraduate students from Ahvaz universities (Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Chamran University, Islamic azad University) were selected using Voluntary sampling method and responded to the Cassidy Academic resilience Scale and Fredericks et al. Academic Engagement Scale. Reliability using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Convergent validity using Pearson correlation coefficient, and construct validity using confirmatory factor analysis were calculated.The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-23 and AMOS-21 software.
Result: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the ratio χ2/df is 1.89 for three factor structure and fit indexes of model were satisfactory and reasonable. Reliability according to Cronbach's alpha coefficient for Academic resilience Scale was reported 0.85 (perseverance = 0.75, reflecting and adaptive help-seeking= 0.76, negative affect and emotional response= 0.78).  There is also a positive and significant correlation between academic resilience and Academic Engagement and Convergent validity is confirmed (r= 0.35).
Conclusion: According to the results of current research, the Academic resilience Scale is a reliable instrument with valid psychometric properties to measure Academic Adjustment in Iranian students and students with lower academic resilience can be identified And take appropriate psychological measures for them.
