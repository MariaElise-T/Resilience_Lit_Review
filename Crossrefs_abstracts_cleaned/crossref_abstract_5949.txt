 Several efforts have focused on the continuous improvement of firm performance, but many disturbances still occur because of various random failures. Resilience which is the ability to withstand shock and maintain critical function, has been recognized as an important approach to keep a firm operating in varying conditions, even if these conditions are excepted or not. With the objective to further enhance firm performance and be part of a sustainable development, it is necessary to study this performance through the resilience in order to manage all disturbances. The objective of this work is to propose a specific management model able to define the functions and barriers that contribute to the resilience of sustainable performance of firm. In this paper, the methodology is explained in detail, and its application trough textile firm is discussed.
