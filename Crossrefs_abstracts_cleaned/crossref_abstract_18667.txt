AbstractThe FKBP5 gene is known to have an important role in alcohol use disorder (AUD) in response to stress and has been reported to affect stress responses by interacting with childhood trauma. This study investigated the effects of the FKBP5 polymorphism rs1360780 and childhood trauma on trait resilience in male patients with AUD. In addition, allele-specific associations between FKBP5 DNA methylation and resilience were examined. In total, 297 men with AUD were assessed for alcohol use severity, childhood trauma, resilience, and impulsivity. Genotyping for FKBP5 rs1360780 and DNA methylation were analyzed. The effects of the rs1360780 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and clinical variables on resilience were tested using linear regression analysis. Possible associations between FKBP5 DNA methylation and resilience were tested with partial correlation analysis. The rs1360780 risk allele, a low education level, and high impulsivity were associated with diminished resilience, whereas no significant main or interaction effect of childhood trauma with the SNP rs1360780 genotype on resilience was shown. No significant association between FKBP5 DNA methylation and resilience was found. The present study demonstrated the involvement of the rs1360780 risk allele in trait resilience in men with AUD, suggesting that the genetic vulnerability of FKBP5 may influence resilience related to AUD.
