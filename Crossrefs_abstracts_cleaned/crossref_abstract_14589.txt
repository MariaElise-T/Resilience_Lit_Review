Abstract
The lack of a strong national US strategy to respond to the threat of climate change places significant responsibility on urban areas to mitigate their risks through resilience planning. However, urban riskscapes include a complex and unequal layering of risks, with historically disadvantaged populations often bearing the brunt of many forms of cumulative risk while realising the fewest benefits from urban amenities. This article contributes to scholarship on resilience planning through an analysis of current development plans and resident perceptions in a neighbourhood in Southwest Washington, DC, by integrating insights on social inequality from the study of urban development, social capital and riskscapes.
