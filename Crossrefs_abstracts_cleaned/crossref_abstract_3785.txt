SummaryData recovery under collision of primary/secondary users in cognitive radio networks is largely an unaddressed problem. Existing approaches require either (a) retransmissions, (b) interference‐free alignment of transmission parameters, or (c) prior knowledge for data recovery. In contrast to the existing approaches, the paper proposes estimation of channel state information based on received collided frames and recommends techniques for spectrum sharing, collision detection, and data recovery. Specifically, based on estimated channel vector, interference‐resilient spectrum‐sharing protocol and techniques are proposed for (a) identification of primary user (PU) activity before (or during) secondary user's (SU's) transmission, (b) MIMO channel estimation under collision, (c) optimal pilot permutation, and (d) interference cancellation (with/without receiver diversity). Results are reported for different baseband modulation techniques under frequency selective/flat fading channel scenarios that demonstrate the efficacy of a proposed work.
