In the context of climate change, increases in extreme weather have caused a series of problems, severely reduced crop yield, and caused a loss of agricultural cultivation. In addition, because of the high economic benefits, continuous cropping has become more popular but it leads to higher land-use intensity in production systems, aggravating the problems of extreme climate and seriously influencing China’s agricultural production and ecological environment. From this, the importance of improvements to cropping systems’ resilience to climate change is now much clearer than before. Crop rotation is an important tool for improving the climate resilience of the agricultural production system and effectively solving the shortcomings of the current continuous crop methodology. Crop rotation is indispensable in many national strategies, including food security, ecological environment development, and rural revitalization. This study aimed to promote the improvement of the crop rotation system in China and aimed to play a significant role in guiding China towards the large-scale development of crop rotation. This literature review shows that crop rotation can effectively enhance climate resilience and reduce the fragility of agricultural cropping systems. It then delves into the origin and development of crop rotation, and summarizes the characteristics of crop rotation. In view of the neglect of ecological benefits in China’s agricultural development, this article puts forward three suggestions: first, developing crop rotation technology based on local conditions; second, paying attention to the ecological benefits of crop rotation subsidies, followed by implementing appropriate and flexible subsidy policies; and, finally, carrying out rational evaluations and policy adjustment of crop rotation practices.
