The concept of intelligent logistics has become mature. However, most of the researches on risk management and emergency response for intelligent logistics system only focus on some specific systems, and ignore the discussions on the overall system. Thus, in order to establish emergency response model for intelligent logistics system, the accident management process of intelligent logistics system was analyzed, the accident management model of the system based on the resilience theory was designed, and finally a model of emergency response for intelligent logistics system from the perspective of dynamic accident management was developed. Results show that this model reflects the dynamic process of intelligent logistics system subjected to random accidental impacts, the in-depth learning of the intelligent logistics system for incident handling and the enhancement of the systemâ€™s risk resistance through feedback data on incident handling are reflected in the model. Conclusion obtained from this study provides a theoretical reference for the optimizing of researches on mechanism of emergency response.
