Against the backdrop of China’s continuous promotion of green and low-carbon transformation and the development of construction industrialization, high-strength composite structural systems have significant development prospects. However, their research and application in the field of construction are insufficient. In response to this issue, the study proposes a new high-performance structural system, namely the composite frame–high-strength steel plate wall core tube resilient structural system, which includes a core tube composed of double steel plate concrete composite shear walls and replaceable energy dissipation coupling beams, as well as composite frames. The highest strength grades of the steel plate and concrete used in the composite walls of the core tube are Q550 and C100, respectively. Using a 200 m building as an example, this study designs and establishes models for this high-performance structure and a conventional reinforced concrete frame–core tube structure. Subsequently, the dynamic elastoplastic time history analysis and seismic resilience assessment of structures are conducted under design basis earthquakes (DBEs), maximum considered earthquakes (MCEs), and extremely rare earthquakes (EREs). Research has shown that, compared to conventional structures, the thickness of shear walls of new high-performance structures can be effectively reduced, which helps decrease the self-weight of the structure and improve the available space in buildings. Additionally, high-performance structures exhibit a better performance in controlling the story drift ratio, lower plastic damage and overall stiffness degradation of the structure, and better seismic performance. The seismic resilience of the high-performance structure has been significantly enhanced, especially in terms of minimizing casualties, thereby better ensuring the safety of people’s lives and property.
