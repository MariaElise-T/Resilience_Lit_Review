Abstract
The direct support professional (DSP) workforce shortage crisis has reached untenable levels during the COVID-19 pandemic as DSPs rapidly exit the workforce. To gain a better understanding of factors that contribute to DSP resilience during stressful and challenging times, we interviewed 10 DSPs identified by colleagues as resilient to elicit strategies to promote DSP resilience. Our content analysis revealed nine distinct strategies: (a) communication; (b) self-worth and recognition; (c) authentic, equitable relationships; (d) embracing change and learning; (e) establishing and maintaining boundaries; (f) cultivating an intentional mindset; (g) self-care; (h) spirituality/“the bigger picture”; and (i) a daily practice of humor and fun.
