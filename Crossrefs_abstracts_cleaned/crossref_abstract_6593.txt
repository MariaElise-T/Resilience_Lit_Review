Traditionally, much research effort has been invested into focusing on disease, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, identifying risk factors, and developing effective treatments. A few recent studies unraveling the basis for absence of disease, including cardiovascular disease, despite existing risk factors, a phenomenon commonly known as resilience, are adding new knowledge and suggesting novel therapeutic approaches. Given the central role of endothelial function in cardiovascular health, we herein provide a number of considerations that warrant future research and considering a paradigm shift toward identifying the molecular underpinnings of endothelial resilience.
