This study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using both the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 25) and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) to create a validated, synergistic, higher-order factor we call Invicti Anima based on the responses 630 teachers and building-based educational leaders in three northeastern USA states. Controlling for important contextual variables including educator sense of agency, our structural equation path model mapped the relationships between educator role, level of Invicti Anima, and Job Satisfaction, as measured by the Job Satisfaction Index (JSI). The educators in our study who were strong in Invicti Anima exhibited characteristics of both resiliency and mindfulness, and were significantly and substantially more satisfied on their jobs, even net of their sense of control (agency) in their schools. Our findings have important implications for the professional development of educators in dealing with stress, longevity in their positions, and positive outcomes for the students and others under their direction.
