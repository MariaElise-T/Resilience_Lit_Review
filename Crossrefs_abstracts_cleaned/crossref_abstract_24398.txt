Objective. This study was aimed at determining the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between stress and couple burnout in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods. In this cross-sectional analytical study, 200 people with MS from Guilan province participated, chosen by convenience sampling method and using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Couple Burnout Measure (CBM). Data analysis was performed in SPSS-24 and Amos-24 software using structural equation model method. Results. According to the results, the proposed model has a good fit (ꭕ2= 18.36, df=13, p=.145, ꭕ2/df=1.41, CFI=.99, GFI=.97, TLI=.99, RMSEA=.04). Moreover, according to the path analysis results, stress directly effects couple burnout (β=-.631, p=.001) with the mediating role of resilience (β=.418, p=.001). Conclusion. In general, it can be claimed that in people with MS, stress is a factor affecting couple burnout; besides, this relationship is mediated by resilience. Accordingly, the implementation of psychological interventions based on stress management and resilience promotion is recommended.
