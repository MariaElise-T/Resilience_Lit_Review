This exploratory study examines the current state of disaster management preparedness and resilience in Kuwaiti organizations, focusing on sustainability. The study employed a cross-sectional survey design, using a web-based questionnaire distributed through social media platforms, collecting data from 438 respondents representing a diverse range of institutions and job classes. The study assessed employees’ perceptions of their institutions’ competence in disaster management, addressing four phases of the disaster management cycle: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The findings reveal areas for potential improvement in Kuwaiti organizations’ preparedness and resilience towards disasters and crises, highlighting the need for ongoing training programs, infrastructure investment, and supply chain sustainability. Discrepancies in perceptions of potential risks and the effectiveness of training programs were identified, as well as concerns about the selection process for disaster management response teams. The study’s findings emphasize the importance of developing comprehensive, sustainable disaster management strategies that prioritize employee safety, operational continuity, and realistic recovery plans. The results contribute significant insights for policy and practice development in Kuwait and other countries facing similar challenges, laying the groundwork for future research on operations and supply chain management within the context of disaster management.
