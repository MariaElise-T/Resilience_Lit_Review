In the process of rapid urbanization in China, rural areas are facing increasingly complex changes and challenges. Resilience theory provides a multidimensional perspective of the sustainable development of rural regions. As a subset of the broader resilience framework, spatial resilience focuses on inter-component relationships and systematic characteristics at the spatial level. It projects the potential of resilience theory into the spatial domain of human habitats. This paper endeavors to integrate spatial resilience theory into the field of rural built environments. At the village level, relevant factors were extracted, and an exploratory analysis focusing on rural spatial resilience was conducted. Twenty-one villages in southern Jiangsu at various resilience levels were selected as empirical cases. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was employed to identify four configurations with sufficient conditions for rural spatial resilience. Furthermore, through an analysis of typical villages, the effective mechanisms of the relevant resilience factors were also elucidated. Our findings reveal several key points: (1) rural spatial resilience relies on an optimal combination of multiple factors rather than a single factor; (2) there are multiple potential pathways through which to enhance rural resilience; (3) and the configuration analysis of the rural factors of spatial resilience helps to narrow the distance between spatial resilience theory and spatial practice. This study validates and refines the application of spatial resilience theory in the context of the rural built environment. Corresponding suggestions are proposed for building a resilient countryside, aiming to provide support and reference for future development strategies in rural areas.
