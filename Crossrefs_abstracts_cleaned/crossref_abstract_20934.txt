ABSTRACT Objectives: to analyze and compare levels of stress and resilience in nurses before and after the assessment for maintenance of the Hospital Accreditation Certification. Methods: quantitative, observational, and longitudinal research, with 53 nurses from a philanthropic hospital, in the Rio Grande do Sul. Data collected in two stages, March, and July 2019, before the assessment visit and 60 days after, using the Bianchi Stress Scale and Resilience Scale. Descriptive and analytical statistics were employed. Results: the majority of participants showed an average stress level before and after the evaluation. The highest stress scores were related to Domains E (coordination of unit activities) and C (activities related to personnel administration). In both moments of the study, the participants had medium and high resilience. Conclusions: managing people, processes, and assistance are stressful activities in the Accreditation process and increase the nursesâ€™ stress levels.
