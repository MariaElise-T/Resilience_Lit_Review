The study intends to explore the experiences of these Frontliners in doing their service to people despite the risks and threats to their lives. It used a grounded theory approach to generate themes, and themes emerge from the data drawn from varied situations and contexts to capture and explain the essence of meaning or experience of the Frontliners. As a result, categories and sub-categories had emerged from narratives of experiences of the Frontliners. Becoming resilient and selfless are two larger categories that transpired after all the categories and sub-categories were combined. Resilience and selflessness emerged as important attributes manifested by the Frontliners in doing service despite the pandemic threats.
