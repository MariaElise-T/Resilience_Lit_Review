            Little research has been done to compare resilience, as measured by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), across common sports medicine patient populations. Our purpose was to investigate resilience levels across sports medicine patient populations. All patients who underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR), partial meniscectomy (PM), meniscal repair (MR), rotator cuff repair (RCR), or shoulder stabilization (SS) between January 1 and June 30, 2020, were screened for inclusion. At our institution, BRS scores are routinely collected during the preoperative period. Patients with preoperative BRS scores available were included for analysis. Patients who were eligible on the basis of ACLR who underwent concomitant PM or MR were included in the ACL group. A total of 655 patients with a median age of 49 years were included in analysis. The median preoperative resilience score across all patients was 3.83 (interquartile range, 3.50–4.17), and the highest scores were seen in the ACLR group (median, 4.00; interquartile range, 3.67–4.17). On multivariate regression, scores were significantly and independently lower in the PM and RCR groups. Male patients were found to have significantly higher scores than female patients overall (
            P
            =.028), but in subgroup analysis by pathology, this effect was only seen in the SS and PM groups. Psychological factors are important to consider when surgically treating patients, and resilience specifically may play a role in predicting treatment success. Patients undergoing PM and RCR tend to report lower resilience scores than patients undergoing ACLR at preoperative baseline. [
