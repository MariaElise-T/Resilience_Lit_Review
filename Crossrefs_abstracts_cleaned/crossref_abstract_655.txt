 Disaster mental health work requires additional skills and an enlarged vision of the human condition that values the resiliency and strengths that people have. Using models most social workers are trained to apply in clinical work is a potentially dangerous trap: People are likely to be perceived by professionals as victims or broken people, and lacking needed strength and resilience if that clinical lens is automatically or universally applied to people who experience traumatic incidents (terrorism, natural disasters, or the unexpected or violent death of a family member, peer, or significant other). Focusing only on the individual in these situations can cause professionals to lose the ability to focus equally upon the institutional and communal social systems that have also been thrown into chaos.
