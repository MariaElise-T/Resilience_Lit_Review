This study explored the experiences of 10 Puerto Rican middle and high school preservice teachers at the end of their student teaching experience. The qualitative design, using the focus group technique, provided insight into the phenomenon of teachers’ resilience. The analysis incorporated the main constructs of resilience-building proposed by Jordan’s model of relational resilience: mutuality, empowerment, and development of courage. This study reinforced the notion of the importance of promoting supportive relationships with mentors and students. These relationships empowered teachers and helped them become more skilled in their profession. Addressing more aspects of resilience-building including before, during, and after their student teaching field experience could benefit preservice teachers in thriving in the profession induction process.
