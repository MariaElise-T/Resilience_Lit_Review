 Despite the challenges facing Indigenous youth and their communities due to historical and contemporary institutionalised racism in Canada, communities are drawing on the richness of their own histories to reassert their cultural heritage. Doing so supports mental health outcomes of young people in particular, as highlighted in a compelling body of research. The question facing many communities, however, is how they can facilitate such child and youth engagement in order to support related positive mental health outcomes. This article reports on findings from a Participatory Action Research (PAR) study conducted in a First Nations community in Unama’ki (Cape Breton), Atlantic Canada. The study, Spaces & Places, was a partnership between the community-based mental health service provider (Eskasoni Mental Health Services, EMHS), eight community youth (14–18 years old), and a team of academics. Situated within a resilience framework, the team explored the ways in which the community facilitated, or restricted, youth civic and cultural engagement. Foregrounded against a strong legacy of cultural reassertion within the community, findings highlight the core resilience-promoting resources that support positive youth development. Additionally, findings demonstrate how these resources provide meaningful support for youth because of the way in which they are intertwined with one another. Furthermore, cultural engagement is underpinned by the Two-eyed Seeing model, supporting youth to integrate their own culture with settler culture in ways that work best for them. Findings support community-based service structures, and underscore the importance of community resilience in the effective support of Indigenous children and youth.
