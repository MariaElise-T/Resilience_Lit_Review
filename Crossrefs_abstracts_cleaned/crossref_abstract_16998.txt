Background
To investigate the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and internet gaming disorder (IGD) and the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between these two factors.


Methods
The adverse childhood experience scale, resilience scale and IGD Scale were administered to 9349 university students. Correlations and mediating effects were calculated among these scores.


Results
After controlling for sex and age, significant correlations among adverse childhood experiences, resilience and IGD were observed; resilience was a partial mediator variable in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and IGD.


Conclusions
The more adverse childhood experiences an individual has, the less their mental toughness and the greater their tendency to become addicted to internet games. Adverse childhood experiences can effectively predict IGD, and the risk of becoming addicted to the internet can be decreased by increasing one's mental toughness.
