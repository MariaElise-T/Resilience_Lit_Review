Resilience is the capability of a system to resist any hazard and revive to a desirable performance. The consequences of such hazards require the development of resilient infrastructure to ensure community safety and sustainability. However, resilience-based housing infrastructure design is a challenging task due to a lack of appropriate post-disaster datasets and the non-availability of resilience models for housing infrastructure. Hence, it is necessary to build a resilience model for housing infrastructure based on a realistic dataset. In this work, a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model was developed for housing infrastructure resilience. The proposed model was tested in a real community in Northeast India and the reliability, recovery, and resilience of housing infrastructure against flood hazards for that community were quantified. The required data for resilience quantification were collected by conducting a field survey and from public reports and documents. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the critical parameters of the proposed BBN model, which can be used to inform designers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making resilience-based decisions.
