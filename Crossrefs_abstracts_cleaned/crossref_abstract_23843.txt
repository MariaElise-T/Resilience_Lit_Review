Background Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) is a workplace resilience-building intervention that has shown reductions in perceived stress and burnout, as well as increased resilience and work engagement in health care workers. Objective To evaluate effects of MIM delivered in a synchronous virtual format on self-reported respiratory rates (RR), as well as perceived stress and resiliency of health care workers. Methods Breath counts were self-reported by 275 participants before and after 8 weekly MIM sessions. MIM was delivered virtually in a group format as a structured, evidence-based workplace intervention including a variety of mindfulness, relaxation, and resilience-building techniques. Participants counted their breaths for 30 seconds, which was then multiplied by 2 to report RR. Additionally, participants completed Perceived Stress Scale and Connor–Davidson Resiliency Scale. Results According to mixed effect analyses there were main effects of MIM Session (P < .001) and Weeks (P < .001), but no Session by Week interaction (P = .489) on RR. On average, RR prior to MIM sessions were reduced from 13.24 bpm (95% CI = 12.94, 13.55 bpm) to 9.69 bpm (95% CI = 9.39, 9.99 bpm). When comparing average Pre-MIM and Post-MIM RR throughout the MIM intervention, Week-2 (mean = 12.34; 95% CI = 11.89, 12.79 bpm) was not significantly different than Week-1 (mean = 12.78; 95% CI = 12.34, 13.23 bpm), but Week-3 through Week-8 demonstrated significantly lower average Pre-MIM and Post-MIM RR compared to Week-1 (average weekly difference range: 1.36 to 2.48 bpm, P < .05). Perceived stress was reduced from Week-1 (17.52 ± 6.25) to after Week-8 (13.52 ± 6.04; P < .001), while perceived resiliency was increased from Week-1 (11.30 ± 5.14) to after Week-8 (19.29 ± 2.58); P < .001). Conclusion Thus far, completion of MIM sessions has shown acute and long-term effects on self-reported RR, but more research is required to determine the extent of improved parasympathetic (relaxed) states. Collectively, this work has shown value for mind–body stress mitigation and resiliency-building in high stress acute health care environments.
