AbstractResearch and the dissemination of evidence‐based guidelines for best practice in crop production are fundamental for the protection of our crop yields against biotic and abiotic threats, and for meeting ambitious food production targets by 2050. The advances in knowledge required for sustaining crop productivity targets will be gained through three research tracks: (1) basic strategic research in the field, for example, crop breeding, agronomy, and advanced phenotyping; (2) translational research involving the application of advances in fundamental science; and (3) pure fundamental research to fuel future translational research. We propose that policy and funding structures need to be improved to facilitate and encourage more interactions between scientists involved in all three research tracks, and also between researchers and farmers, to improve the effectiveness of delivering improvements in crop stress resilience. History illustrates that it is challenging for public researchers to “stretch across” all of these research tracks, with effective farm‐level solutions being more likely when end‐users and industry are directly engaged in the research pipeline. As research proceeds from fundamental through to applied research, the demand for experimental rigor and a wider understanding of appropriate methods and outcomes is paramount, that is, demonstrating value in yield at the field level requires the input of experienced practitioners from each research track. The development of evidence‐based policies to support all funding structures and the engagement of producers with both the development of research, and with the findings of such research, will form an important capability in meeting food security targets. This commentary, concentrating on the development of policies to support research and its dissemination, is based on discussions held at the Stress Resilience Symposium organized by the Global Plant Council and Society of Experimental Biology in October 2015.
