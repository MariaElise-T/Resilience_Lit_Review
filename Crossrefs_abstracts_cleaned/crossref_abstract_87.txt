AbstractAs the backbone and the ‘blood vessel’ of modern cities, road networks provide critical support for community activities and economic growth, with their roles even more crucial due to the dramatic progress in urbanization. The service of road networks is subjected to the increasing frequency of high-consequence natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, etc. Identifying resilient restoration sequences is essential to mitigate the disruption of such important infrastructure networks. This paper investigates a novel decision-support model to optimize post-disaster road network repair sequence. The model, named as GCN-DRL model, integrates the advantages of deep reinforced learning (DRL) with graph convolutional neural network (GCN), two emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to achieve efficient recovery of road network service. The model is applied to analyze two cases of community road networks in the US that are subjected to different types of hazards, i.e., earthquakes and flooding. The performance of repair sequence by the GCN-DRL model is compared with two commonly used methods, i.e., repair sequence by the genetic algorithm and by prioritization based on graph importance with betweenness centrality. The results showed the decision sequence by GCN-DRL model consistently achieved superior performance in road network restoration than the conventional methods. The AI-based decision model also features high computational efficiency since the GCN-DRL model can be trained before the hazard. With a pre-trained GCN-DRL model, a close to optimal decision-making process can be made available rapidly for different types of new hazards, which is advantageous in efficiently responding to hazards when they happen. This study demonstrates the promise of a new AI-based decision support model to improve the resilience of road networks by enabling efficient post-hazards recovery.
