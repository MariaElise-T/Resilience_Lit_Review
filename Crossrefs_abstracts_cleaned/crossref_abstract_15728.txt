AbstractThe incidence of extreme natural hazard events in the U.S. has been rising, with far‐reaching implications for the U.S. agricultural sector. Yet, government expenditures on natural hazards in agriculture remain largely concentrated on recovery programs that compensate producers for damages after the fact. This article presents a risk management approach that incorporates a focus on prevention and mitigation which could offer greater cost‐effectiveness and help to build a more resilient agricultural sector. In this context, we explore the U.S. agricultural risk management policy landscape and identify some possibilities for how such an approach could be integrated into current programming.
