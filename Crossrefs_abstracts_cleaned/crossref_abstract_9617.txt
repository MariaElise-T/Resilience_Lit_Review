This study aimed to make a comparison between the levels of attitudes towards Distance Education, Coronavirus Burnout and Psychological Resilience levels of university students in Turkey with the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and to determine the level of relationship among them during the pandemic period, which was defined as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization and declared as a global pandemic. In order to collect data from the sample, the Attitudes towards Distance Education Scale, the Coronavirus Burnout Scale and the Psychological Resilience Scale were implemented together. In the study, a structural model was tested by analysing the data obtained from the scales in order to determine whether the level of attitudes towards Distance Education is affected by the level of Coronavirus Burnout and Psychological Resilience. The findings of the analysis indicates that the level of Coronavirus Burnout negatively affects the level of Attitudes towards Distance Education, the level of Psychological Resilience positively affects the level of Attitudes towards Distance Education, and the level of Psychological Resilience negatively affects the level of Coronavirus Burnout. It is clear that there is a need for further measurement and evaluation in order to minimise the impact of global crisis periods on education and to produce effective and correct policies in the field of education. We believe that the findings of our study will help in the planning of national education systems in a more effective way after the COVID-19 pandemic.
