Objective: The current study aimed to investigate the role of Emotional Regulation (ER) and resilience in predicting students' academic burnout.   Methods: This was a descriptive correlational study. The statistical population of the study included all female secondary school students of the 10th-grade of the humanities and experimental sciences (N=305) in the second semester of 2018-2019 in Shabestar City, Iran. Accordingly, a sample of 100 individuals was selected by cluster sampling method. To collect the required data, the Academic Burnout Questionnaire (Breso et al., 1997), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross & John, 2003), and the Samuels' Academic Resilience Scale (2004) were used. Results: The collected data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis methods. The obtained results indicated that ER and academic resilience explained 37% of the total variance of academic burnout in the examined students. The F-value indicated that the prediction of academic burnout was significantly based on ER and academic resilience in the study participants (P=0.001).  Conclusion: As per the present study, the long-term planning to increase the explored variables will be an essential step in preventing students' academic burnout.
