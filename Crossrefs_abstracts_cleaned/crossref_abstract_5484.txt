Disasters have detrimental effects on environmental aspects. This research aims to investigate the negative impacts of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and land drought on the environment. This research aims to determine the impact of natural disasters on environmental factors. The data used in this research was obtained from Podes 2021 and the Environmental Resilience Index (IKL) 2022 and 2023. The method applied in this research is multiple linear regression. The results of this research show that natural disasters have a negative impact on environmental conditions. Of the three independent variables for natural disasters in this study, it is known that volcanic eruptions have the most significant negative effects, both one year and two years after the event occurs. The negative impacts of natural disasters are still felt by the community at least 2 years after the disaster occurs. Therefore, an extra role is needed from the government to carry out evacuations when a disaster occurs, as well as implementing mitigation measures early on to reduce negative impacts.
