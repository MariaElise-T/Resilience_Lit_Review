IntroductionOccupational therapy has long had a strong presence in military mental healthcare. Today’s veterans have complex needs and can face challenges reintegrating into civilian life. This exploratory study investigated whether veterans receiving mental health treatment who participated in a bespoke occupational therapy and resilience workshop intervention improved their perceived participation in everyday life.MethodAn interpretivist hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to explore veterans’ perspectives. Ten participants took part in two semistructured focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to identify and analyse patterns within the data.FindingsMost participants developed occupational goals and started to make lifestyle changes; participants developed an appreciation of the value of occupation; participants developed insight into their recovery journeys; and value was placed on the ‘healing power’ of the group.ConclusionThis exploratory study provides preliminary evidence to suggest occupational therapy was influential in helping participants understand the impact of occupation on health and start making lifestyle changes. Participants also reflected on their recovery journeys. The benefits of doing this within a group environment appear to have been particularly therapeutic. Original occupational therapy research in this specialism is sparse. This novel study provides insight that can further discussion and enhance understanding about what the profession can offer this client group.
