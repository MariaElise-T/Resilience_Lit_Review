This study aims to determine the effect of the implementation of urban farming workshops on food security of Jogoyudan Village residents supporting the concept of Yogyakarta as a Resilient City as a disaster risk reduction. This study is a quasi-experimental study using a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design. This study involved 200 residents in 4 RWs (Neighborhoods) in Jogoyudan Village as the research sample selected by cluster random sampling. RW 08 and RW 10 as the experimental group, while RW 11 and RW 12 as the control group. The research data were collected through assessment instruments in the form of pretest and posttest that were analyzed quantitatively, as well as using the method of observation and documentation. The result of this study indicates that the implementation of the urban farming workshop has a positive effect on improving the understanding level of food security of the people in Jogoyudan Village as evidenced by the value of the Wilcoxon test of 0.000 (α > 0.05) and the Mann-Witney test of 0.000 (α > 0.05). In addition to that, the urban farming workshop can also provide participants with farming skills, which can facilitate greater and easier access for food which is the main indicator of food security, as attested by the experimental group in Jogoyudan Village who was able to independently make hydroponic installations at their homes. This shows that the urban farming workshop can be one of the ways toward disaster risk reduction supporting the realization of Yogyakarta as a Resilient City.
