A number of studies indicate that EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) may be efficacious in treatment of children and young people with symptoms of posttraumatic stress. However, reports are limited in the use of the EMDR psychotherapy approach in situations of ongoing violence and trauma. This case study describes work with seven children in an area of ongoing violence who were subject to repeat traumas during the course of an EMDR psychotherapy intervention, using a group protocol. Results indicate that the EMDR approach can be effective in a group setting, and in an acute situation, both in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic and peritraumatic stress and in “inoculation” or building resilience in a setting of ongoing conflict and trauma. Given the need for such applications, further research is recommended regarding EMDR’s ability to increase personal resources in such settings.
