 In British Columbia, Canada, a recent epidemic of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, 1902) caused widespread forest mortality. This epidemic was due in part to the changing climate, and damage from pests and diseases is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, we used a historical retrospective approach as a proxy to evaluate management options on reducing the forest health damage that may occur under a future changing climate. We assessed two landscape-scale strategies, intended to increase tree species diversity, for the response in ecosystem resilience and compared the results with the business-as-usual strategy. The assessment was based on simulation modelling of the Merritt Timber Supply Area for 1980â€“2060. We applied a strategy to increase the harvest of the most dominant tree species, plant more diverse species, and increase natural regeneration. This strategy resulted in greater ecological resilience (higher diversity and growing stocks), higher harvest rates, and higher, more consistent net revenue over time than the business-as-usual strategy or the strategy that only employed a diversity of planting. A sensitivity analysis indicated a high level of robustness in the results. Our study showed that it may not be necessary to compromise economic viability to reduce forest health risks and consequently improve socio-ecological resilience.
