Background:The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and resilience are important aspects of colorectal cancer care, as well as an indicator of patients' health status. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between resilience and HRQoL among patients with a permanent colostomy.Method:A cross-sectional descriptive correlational design employing the City of Hope Quality of Life Ostomy Questionnaire and the Resilience Scale was adopted. A purposive sample population was recruited.Results:The study enrolled 158 colostomy patients. Half the participants (50.6%) were female and the mean age was 58.20 years [standard deviation (SD)=8.70]. Colostomy patients had a mean HRQoL score of 129.61 (SD)=98 (interquartile range: 109–148), with a spiritual domain that was lower than any other HRQoL domain. The Resilience Scale mean score was 106 (interquartile range: 82–126).Conclusion:This study observed a general low score on the HRQoL Questionnaire and this was reflected in the Resilience Scale score of this group of patients with a colostomy.
