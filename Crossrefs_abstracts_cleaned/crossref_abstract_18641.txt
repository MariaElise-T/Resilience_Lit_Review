 We need more GPs in the UK if we are to manage our ageing and increasingly multi-morbid population. However, there is a manpower crisis in NHS primary care, with GP recruitment falling and older doctors taking early retirement. Although there has been considerable research into medical staff stress, there are relatively few studies of coping and resilience in doctors. However, there is some evidence that intensive, brief resilience training can be beneficial. Our aim was to establish if REFRAME could help GPs develop skills that improve their well-being and resilience and to establish whether participants feel the outcome measures employed capture their experience.
