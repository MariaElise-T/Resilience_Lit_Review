Recent disasters have highlighted the gap between existing urbancentric resilience models and the needs of rural communities, which are frequently marginalized. Large rural constituencies, encompassing vast and sparsely populated areas, lack broadband connectivity and rely predominantly on volunteer-based emergency workforce. The above are some of the key factors hampering rural first responders? ability to access, act upon and disseminate emergency-related information. This has an adverse effect on both residents and the agencies that serve them, as it limits residents? ability to prepare for emergencies and compromises the safety of first responders. Furthermore, the unique socio-economic structure of rural areas makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of incipient or unfolding disasters. Hence, rural communities often develop self-reliance capabilities by creating tightknit social structures and taking charge of their own technological progress through community-driven efforts.
