Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recognised as a diagnostic entity in 1980, was originally associated with combat or war experiences. It has since been recognised that it is prevalent in any population exposed to traumatic events.

This article reviews the conceptualisation, epidemiology and comorbidities of PTSD and highlights the factors underlying vulnerability and conveying resilience.
