PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate racial differences in the moderating role of factors linked with resilience on the relationship between economic stress and happiness for Black and White residents of the USA.Design/methodology/approachSecondary data were downloaded from the World Values Survey Wave 7 for adult respondents living in the USA. The entire sample of respondents who self-identified as belonging to the Black race (n = 209) was statistically matched (based on sex – 50% male and average age – 39 years) with a similarly sized random sample of respondents who self-identified as belonging to the White race (n = 217).FindingsThe results suggest that economic stress had the potential to trigger a resilience response. However, the protective factors in the resilience process differed by race of the respondent. The relationship between economic stress and perceptions of neighborhood safety was conditional on level of control for the White sample. The relationship between economic stress and happiness for the Black sample was conditional on the importance of faith.Originality/valueThe study was able to demonstrate the importance of race-based contextual differences in the roles of faith and control in the resilience process. The findings also increase the understanding of how life circumstances and individual characteristics, including race, impact happiness and how much or little resilience may play a part in the achievement of happiness.
