Vision 2030 is Kenya's economic blueprint whose focus is to guide the country in the transformational agenda of achieving a newly industrialized, middle-income country; a country where citizens enjoy high quality life in a clean and secure environment by the year 2030. Appreciating that agriculture is the backbone of the Kenya’s economy, it is critical to inject efficiency in food security projects to guarantee sustainable food security. However, the current food production system is not keen on maintaining value of resources, hence, catalysing soil degradation, deforestation, water depletion, and Green House Gas emissions. Consequently, climate change, food insecurity, slowed economy, unemployment, and poverty. The resultant effect is poor human health, inability to cope with shocks, inequalities, and lack of social services. Nonetheless, factual based policies supporting science, technology, and innovation for efficient and effective resource utilization in food security projects will promote the country’s capacity in achieving resilience in food security. This paper will highlight the concept of resource utilization planning to enhance, resources predictability and value maintenance. The study will employ desk review of relevant documents on: resource utilization and food security and nutrition. The findings are expected to provide policy makers with insight on the policies that are required as a fundamental catalyst, in designing and creating an enabling environment for robust food security projects. In return, the food security projects are bound to minimize on extractive activities, Green House Gas emissions, deforestation, soil degradation and water depletion.
