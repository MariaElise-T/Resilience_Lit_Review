The aim of this research is to examine the role of post-traumatic stress symptoms, resilience and hope in post-traumatic growth in individuals who have overcome the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The study group of the research consisted of 454 participants aged between 18 and 72. The mean age of the participants was 32.91, and the standard deviation was 11.18. Participants answered the demographic information form, Post Traumatic Growth Inventory, Trait Hope Scale, Post Traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, and Adult Resilience Scale. The results showed that posttraumatic growth levels of women were significantly higher than men's posttraumatic growth levels. Moreover the post-traumatic growth levels of those who had the disease severely were higher than the post-traumatic growth levels of those who had the disease mildly and moderately. According to the recovery time from the disease, the post-traumatic growth levels of those who had the disease for a long time were found to be higher than the post-traumatic growth levels of those who had the disease in a short time. Post-traumatic stress symptoms, resilience and hope were found to be positive and significant predictors of post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychological resilience and hope-focused psychosocial interventions by mental health professionals and healthcare professionals during the epidemic may help people to endure an unknown disease and cope with the trauma that this disease has created in their lives, thus increasing their post-traumatic growth levels.
