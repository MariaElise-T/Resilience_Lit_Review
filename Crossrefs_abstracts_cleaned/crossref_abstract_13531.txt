ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Significant gaps exist in the identification and management of psychological effects of stroke on survivors. Interventions to enhance resilience, the ability to rebound from stress or adversity, could positively impact stroke recovery. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of meditation on resilience of community-dwelling stroke survivors and to identify resilience predictor variables in these survivors. METHODS: This was a substudy with secondary analysis of existing data from the parent study, MEditatioN for post stroke Depression. The effect of meditation on stroke survivor resilience in the intervention group (n = 20) was evaluated with a paired samples t test, with measures at baseline and immediately after the 4-week intervention. Baseline resilience predictor variables for all stroke survivors (n = 35) were evaluated with univariable analysis and multiple linear regression modeling. RESULTS: The increase in stroke survivor resilience scores from baseline (mean [SD], 3.46 [0.81]) to intervention completion (mean [SD], 3.58 [1.02]) was not statistically significant (t = 0.60, df = 19, P = .56). One-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis revealed that baseline resilience was significantly lower (P = .02) for non-Hispanic black participants than for non-Hispanic white participants. Multiple linear regression with resilience as the dependent variable, race as a fixed factor, and trait anxiety as a covariate was significant (F
3,33 = 6.32, P = .002) and accounted for nearly 33% of the variance in baseline resilience. CONCLUSION: The effects of meditation on stroke survivor resilience should be tested in larger clinical trials that would explore the influence of social determinants of health, perceived stress, race-related stress, and anxiety subtypes on resilience.
