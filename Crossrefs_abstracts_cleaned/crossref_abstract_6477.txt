Presented on Wednesday 18 May: Session 9   The Queensland resources industry will be increasingly affected by global trends, such as decarbonisation, corporate social responsibility, emerging innovations and the rise of the Indo-Pacific region. While these trends create challenges for the resources industry, they present greater opportunities for transformation, growth and diversification. A plan to navigate these trends is critical, and that is why the Queensland Government has committed to delivering a Queensland Resources Industry Development Plan (QRIDP). The QRIDP outlines a 30-year vision for Queensland’s resources industry – petroleum and gas, coal and minerals sectors – to respond to these emerging global trends. The QRIDP’s vision is for ‘a resilient, responsible and sustainable Queensland resources industry that grows as it transforms.’ A range of actions for government and industry to undertake over the coming years to realise this shared vision is included in the QRIDP in its six key focus areas. The QRIDP has been informed through extensive stakeholder consultation and expert advice, with a draft QRIDP released for feedback in November 2021. Feedback received on the draft is being considered by the Department of Resources and a final QRIDP is expected to be released by mid-2022.   To access the presentation click the link on the right.
