One of the major drawbacks of the basic parallel formulations of a PID controller is the effects of proportional and derivative kick. In order to minimize these effects, modified forms of parallel controller structures such as PI-D and I-PD are usually considered in practice. In addition, there is a usual servo/regulation tradeoff regarding closed-loop control system operation. Appropriate tuning is needed for each situation. One way of focusing explicitly on load disturbance is by the appropriate selection of a controller equation. A gap is generated here between the conception of a tuning rule and its final application that may need deployment on different controller equations. There is no danger when we go from PI-D to I-PD as we just change reference processing. However, there will be a loss of performance. The potential loss of performance, depending on the final controller equations used, motivates the authors to introduce the idea of resilient PID tuning: minimize the effects of changing the controller equation on the achieved performance/robustness. Today, this can be seen as a complement to the well-known controller fragility concept. On the basis of this scenario, this paper motivates the analysis of a tuning rule from such a point of view and also emphasizes the benefits that a better process model may provide from such an aspect.
