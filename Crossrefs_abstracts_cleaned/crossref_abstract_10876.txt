The article concerns the experimental building in raw-earth technologies situated in Ecological Park in Pasłęk, in the northeast part of Poland with rather severe climate characteristics for middle and east Europe. The purpose of the designing and realization of the building was to demonstrate the methods of construction in traditional raw-earth technologies with current modifications and then to create the possibility for long-term research and observations at the site visits during the buildings’ exploitation. The building was designed as energy efficient with a passive solar system, green roof, and space arrangement. Construction effects of exploitation were checked. Also, physical aspects were analyzed and thermal-humidity environmental parameters were measured with specialized equipment. Examples of such measurements with appropriate conclusion are presented. Based on the analyses, the authors evaluate the resilience of the applied technology under the given climate conditions, as one of the possible sustainability technologies that can be used in Poland under given restrictions.
