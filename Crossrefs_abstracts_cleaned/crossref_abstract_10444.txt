Abstract
The analysis and optimization of residential outdoor activity space plays a crucial role in building resilient communities. This research takes the Songjiang community in Harbin City as a case study and innovatively combines social network analysis and the spatial synthesis method to comprehensively examine the overall resilience characteristics of the spatial network. Through this analysis, the study identifies resilience challenges and potential areas for improvement in the nodal spaces. As a result, four optimization strategies are proposed, encompassing the expansion of nodal spaces, enrichment of spatial functions, enhancement of spatial accessibility, and integration of emergency functions.
