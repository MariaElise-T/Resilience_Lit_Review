This note presents a short commentary on the recurring urban flooding in India and the challenges the country faces in implementing sustainable drainage practices and developing urban flood resilience. The major incidences of heavy rainfall and the consequent urban flooding and their causes are briefly described. The recent flood disaster management and mitigation measures carried out by the Central, State and Local Government are highlighted. The flood resilience initiatives and challenges are then discussed. The effects of climate change on increased rainfall in shorter durations are now being felt in many Indian cities. The planners are now taking cognizance of this and future flood resilience measures are being planned to incorporate an integrated approach to stormwater management by recommending best management practices in the stormwater manuals. However, a lot still needs to be done to make the cities in India flood resilient.
