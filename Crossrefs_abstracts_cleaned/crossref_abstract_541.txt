Using systems thinking and ecologically-reflexive planning, this study examines conceptual opportunities for resilience and regeneration of the historic northwestern Hungarian municipality of Kőszeg and its surrounding bio-region. It will explain how the town and bio-region's socio-cultural and socio-technical systems —its historic heritage coupled with existing and new industrial, commercial, and infrastructural services (energy, water, sanitation, and waste)—can be placed into a regional development scheme that optimizes the vitality and resiliency of these collective systems, following the principles of a circular economy. This study assessed opportunities for Kőszeg, as one example in the region; to revitalize its economy and its local environment based upon attaining a high level of integration among its multi-dimensional resources. Conceptual strategies for practical solutions to town and bio-regional revitalization and resiliency are discussed.
