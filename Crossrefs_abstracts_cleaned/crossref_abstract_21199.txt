 Mindfulness, resilience, and resourcefulness are theoretically distinct but related constructs critical for improving psychosocial well-being outcomes for informal caregivers and others. Our aims were to evaluate the theoretical and operational distinctions among these constructs. Measures of mindfulness (Decentering Scale), resilience (Connor-Davidson Scale) and resourcefulness (Resourcefulness Scale) were collected from a national sample of 348 grandmother caregivers. We conducted exploratory factor analysis and examined correlation patterns. Inter-correlations ranged from r= .26 (resourcefulness and resilience) to r= .73 (resilience and mindfulness). Factor analyses and scree plots indicated unidimensional factors for resilience and for mindfulness, and two factors for resourcefulness (personal and social). When items from all measures were analyzed together, the four factors remained. Distinct relationships were found between mindfulness, resilience, and resourcefulness with relevant external variables. Our results support the conceptual distinctions among the constructs, providing support for interventions targeting these constructs to improve psychosocial outcomes in caregivers.
