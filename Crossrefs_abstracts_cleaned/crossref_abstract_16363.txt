Abstract
This paper collects all the existing swing bridges around the world to emphasize the high-level technology performed in the earliest 20th century and analyzes the recent experience in the rehabilitation and retrofitting of a singular swing steel bridge.
The bridge over the As√≥n estuary at Treto, in the North of Spain, showed significant problems and the structural condition level was critical previously to its intervention in 2015. The rehabilitation project including the restoration of the structural and functional safety level of the structure was deled after material studies and tests were performed. The new updated of the structure from the old nineteenth centuries to the new standard codes was also performed. A part from the historical value of the bridges and the "green" and safe-security aspects, the intervention took into account all the social requirements of the population in the area who recovered the pride in this emblematic and centenarian infrastructure and it is, itself, a successful intervention from the resilient point of view.
