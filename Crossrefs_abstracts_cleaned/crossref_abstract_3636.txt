The study's objective is to provide an outline of disaster resilience through bibliometric methods. The study delves into the disaster resilience literature spanning the last 20 years to gain a more profound understanding of the related literature. 
A bibliometric analysis of 10 top journals with the most literature using the keyword disaster resilience was conducted, resulting in 1561 articles. The bibliometric network was also visualized using the VOSviewer software tool. 
This study shows that disaster resilience has recently had a significant increase in research activity. Additionally, the study found that the Covid-19 epidemic increased the number of resilience research published between 2020 and 2022. The theoretical framework of the authors was scrutinized, identifying 12 keyword clusters, with the primary focus areas being disaster types, numerical analysis, disaster management, and community and social perspectives. Scholars emphasized resilience, risk reduction, vulnerability reduction, climate change, and disaster management in the literature. This study highlights the current state of disaster resilience research while forecasting the field's future growth and development.
