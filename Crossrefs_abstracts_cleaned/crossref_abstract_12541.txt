Abstract
There is growing interest in deepening resilience building and development programmes that target both individuals and organisations, with implications in almost all areas of social, economic, and political life. The aim of our approach is to illustrate, in quantitative terms, both the place and importance in the literature of some of the most important concepts associated with resilience, namely security, critical infrastructure and security culture, and the links between these concepts.
