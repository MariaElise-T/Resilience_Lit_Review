AbstractThe UN Sendai Framework recognized the need for making our communities safer and more resilient to disasters by shifting policy goals from “managing disasters” to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and building resilience. For DRR and building community resilience to disaster shocks, this study posits that social learning, a process of mutual development and sharing knowledge through iterative reflections on experience, is key to changing the conventional linear logic‐based, reactive framework into one based on learning‐by‐doing (adaptive management). Toward this end, a three‐round Policy Delphi process was pursued with a combination of 18 international DRR and SES (social–ecological systems) resilience scholars, practitioners, and public officials. Weak policy frameworks; operational, cultural and educational/training silos; and domination of technical knowledge were identified as major challenges in knowledge and learning transmission. Balancing technical knowledge with social science, and working toward transdisciplinary approaches and transformative practices should, therefore, be nurtured.
