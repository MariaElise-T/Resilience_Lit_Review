 The present study examined the crosscultural generalizability of the latent structure of the ER89-R, a brief self-report scale that measures ego-resiliency with subjective self-ratings. First, we investigated the measurement invariance of the scale across three Western cultures, namely, Italy (n = 1,020), Spain (n = 452), and the United States (n = 808). Next, we examined the correlations of the ER89-R scale with several measures of adjustment and maladjustment. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence of partial configural, metric, and scalar invariance across Italy, Spain, and the United States. Overall, the correlation patterns were stable across countries and sex, with some exceptions. As expected, higher levels of ego-resiliency were strongly and consistently associated with the positive poles of the Big Five. Moreover, ego-resiliency showed a positive correlation with psychological well-being in each country, and negative relations with depression in Spain and Italy, but not in the United States. In light of these results, the potential usefulness and applicability of the ER89-R scale are advanced and discussed.
