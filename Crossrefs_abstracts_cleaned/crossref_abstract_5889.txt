With the emergence of various emergencies, the importance of supply chain resilience is gradually increasing. At the same time, it is also urgent to build a resilient supply chain system. By reviewing the existing literature at home and abroad, this paper can understand the practical application cases of supply chain resilience, the implementation methods of supply chain resilience and the evaluation scheme of the resilience system. In the context of the increasingly mature blockchain technology, the supply chain and the blockchain technology will be integrated to achieve a more stable and resilient supply chain system.
