 This Introduction to the JPA special issue Assessing Resiliency in Children and Adolescents presents measurement issues encountered in the past as well as criteria for currently needed user friendly measures. These criteria include the following: (a) tools should be based on developmentally appropriate factors of resiliency that are well grounded in theory, (b) should be brief, user friendly and easy to administer, applicable for group and individual use, (c) should be theoretically and practically linked to intervention and (d) be psychometrically sound. Four tools for assessing strengths/resiliency are introduced and discussed in articles that follow in the Special Issue.
