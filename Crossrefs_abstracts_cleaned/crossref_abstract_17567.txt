Is it correct to say that Supply and Demand still rule Supply Chains, or is it the other way around? Either way building a resiliency augmentation to support both situations is a must system that we are missing from any supply and demand or supply chain. Presently, we do not have any Business Resilience System (BRS) built in any of our existing chain of supplies nor within any demand or supply that both business and consumer may ask for when it comes to either one of them. Far from what some economists consider the dismal science, they drive most decisions in the supply chain, and supply chain managers need to be fully aware of the economic conditions that drive their business, their suppliers, and their customers. Last Christmas was a good example of a lack of resiliency. The port of Los Angeles came to an absolute halt when the chain of cargo ships seating off the port and lining up for their goods to be unloaded. Yet, the port authority could not provide the necessary labor resources to be in place to unload these cargo ships. Such shortage of labor and lack of having a contingency plan as a resiliency system created a chase at consumer level from supply and demand, naturally supply chains were in a mess
