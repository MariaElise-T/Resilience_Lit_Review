 This paper describes how the University of Ibadan has sought to build greater resilience to flooding, through its response to the devastating flood in 2011. This included both structural and non-structural components, as well as measures to address the increased risk levels that climate change is bringing or may bring in the future. The paper also draws out some lessons that have wide relevance for other universities.
