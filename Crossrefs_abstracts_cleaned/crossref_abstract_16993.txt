AbstractThe concept of risk, which is defined as a threat to health, wellbeing, financial and employment stability, pervades the COVID‐19 pandemic. These risks are intensified through people's access to and ability to engage with appropriate information. The research reported investigates how information practices enable people to mitigate risks and build the resilience to cope with ongoing uncertainty. The poster will present initial findings from a small pilot study that was carried out in the UK in May–June 2020. Online interviews were used to examine the lived experience of people as the pandemic progressed. Areas that were explored included awareness of emerging risk, and experiences of changing conditions that impacted on working, educational, well‐being and caring practices. A constructivist grounded theory frames the analysis and enables the development of themes which contribute to an emerging risk and resilience narrative. Findings from this research will provide insight into global responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic, while further establishing foundational knowledge that will be useful for civil contingency, emergency services, health and education professions looking to support prepared and informed communities.
