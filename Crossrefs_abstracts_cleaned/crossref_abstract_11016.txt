The study presents the results of measuring the resilience of high school students. The main goal is to find whether there is a link between the resilience of students and preferred coping strategies. Quantitative research was subsequently conducted with students in the 2nd and 3rd years of secondary schools. The research included a questionnaire survey in which students were presented with two questionnaires. The first questionnaire was self-designed and aimed to assess the level of resilience; the second standardized questionnaire focused on the preferred choice of coping strategies. Responses were received from a total of 516 respondents. The data were evaluated using the tools of descriptive statistics. The results showed that pupils' resilience is generally at a good level. In addition, five key factors improving and lowering resilience were identified. Furthermore, five preferred strategies and five strategies that students prefer to avoid when dealing with problem situations were identified. At the same time, a direct correlation between the effort to take an active approach to solve problems and the degree of resilience was observed; this is considered to be the main outcome of the study.
