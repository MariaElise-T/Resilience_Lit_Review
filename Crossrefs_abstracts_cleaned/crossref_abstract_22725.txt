Abstract

Objectives
The inability to adapt to difficult and stressful situations in the environment leads to low resilience ability in street children. Knowing the influencing factors is important to help them achieve optimal resilience. This study aims to analyze the relationship between factors related to street children’s resilience.


Methods
This study used a correlational design with a cross-sectional approach. The population was street children in two halfway-home in Surabaya (Kampung Anak Negeri and Sanggar Alang-Alang). The sample was 129 respondents obtained using simple random sampling. The independent variables were unpleasant past experience, antisocial behavior, level of depression, age, sex, length of time being street children and positive support. The dependent variable was resilience. Data were collected using questionnaires and analyzed by Spearman Rho-test with p<0.05.


Results
The result showed, that unpleasant past experiences (p=0.00 and r= −0.313), level of depression (p=0.00 and r= −0.279) and positive support have an association with resilience (p=0.000 and r=0.331). The lowest unpleasant past experiences and depression levels and the higher positive support will make higher resiliency in street children.


Conclusions
This study has explained the unpleasant past experiences and depression levels as risk factors and the positive support as a supportive factor for street children’s resilience.
