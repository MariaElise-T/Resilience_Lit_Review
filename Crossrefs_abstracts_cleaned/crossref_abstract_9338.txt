In recent years, resilience has emerged as a guiding principle for urban development and disaster risk management. The aim of this study, human development, economic recovery and the factors that influence to reach a high level of security at every level, Turkey is to determine the level of resistance against disasters at the national and international areas of the province.
The study was prepared with a semi-numerical method and the scope of the study was all provinces of our country. Although the study covers 2015-2017 periods, it was applied to all provinces of our country. LRI (Lack of Resilience Index) consists of 8 sub-factors and the index value is between 0 and 1. Classification of index values was done according to international standards as follows; between 0-0.20 as low, between 0.20-0.40 as medium, between 0.40-0.80 as high and between 0,80-1,00 as very high.
Ağrı (0.71), Şırnak (0.66), Muş (0.66) and Hakkâri (0.65) provinces were the first four provinces with the highest value according to the 2015-2017 average value of LRI and Isparta (0.38), Bolu (0.38), Izmir  (0.36) and Ankara (0.32) were the lowest. Moreover, while 93.83% of our provinces were in the high index category, it was seen that 6.17% is in the middle index category and we had no provinces in the low index category.
As a result, it was seen that our provinces had deficiencies regarding lack of resilience, especially the average and expected schooling years, per capita national income, insurance rates of buildings and houses and the number  of hospital beds.
