ABSTRACT
Evaluating contemporary business changes against the backdrop of the concept of turbulent business environment presented by Ansoff in the ’70s allows us to identify a new way of interpreting Ansoff’s description of turbulence as the key characteristic of the business environment. The new business landscape, described by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, BANI (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible) or RUPT (rapid, unpredictable, paradoxical, tangled) acronyms, is complex, illegible and intensified by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. It results in shortening the life-cycle of the organisation as well as the importance needing to be attributed to an organisation’s predisposition towards remaining resilient in the face of turbulence. The paper is based on primary research and aims to identify the role of marketing in contemporary business environment and future development in the context of the idea of resilient organisations. The identified business challenges are addressed using the described marketing functions - ‘customer advocacy’, ‘business owner’ and ‘professional manager’.
