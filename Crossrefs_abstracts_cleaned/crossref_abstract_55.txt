Purpose
We live in a world marked at the same time by collective traumas and suffering of identity. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate reflection on the links between resilience and identity at the individual and collective levels.


Design/methodology/approach
This is an opinion piece using global collective history to put into perspective some psychological aspects of suffering of identity which mental health and social professionals may face in their practices.


Findings
These transformations affect the mental health of people facing multiple choices ranging from the risk of a fantasy of resilient identities to the possibility of a process of identity resilience.


Originality/value
To face this major challenge, professionals should be trained in the global history and anthropology of intercultural relations, to better support patients traumatized by identity threats in a process of resilience.
