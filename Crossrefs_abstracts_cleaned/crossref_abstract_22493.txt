AbstractThe aim of this study was to measure and analyse the association of emotional burnout and resilience with the psychological distress of students who finished their nursing studies after the peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The mental health of nursing students was affected during the pandemic, and resilience seems to counteract the negative effects. This is a cross‐sectional study. The data (quantitative) were gathered at the beginning of the second term of the academic year 2020/2021. The study was carried out in the Spanish university context. Self‐reported measures were gathered using three one‐dimensional, valid, and reliable scales: the Psychological Distress Scale (K‐10), the Emotional Burnout Scale (EBS), and the short version of the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (CD‐RISC10). A total of 393 students of different Spanish universities participated in this study. A valid linear regression model was obtained, which allowed verifying that psychological distress is explained, with 37% variance, by emotional burnout and resilience. The total score in emotional burnout has more relevance than the total score in resilience, and the latter has a negative tendency. Facing the factors that generate emotional burnout in students in the academic scope and promoting resilience in them are fundamental aspects that contribute to their psychological well‐being. The reflection should be extended to clinical practices. Universities are urged to think about last‐year students, their experiences, perceptions, and feelings, to determine how their susceptibility to emotional burnout and psychological distress can be minimized in their future clinical practices. Strategies to promote their resilience should also be studied.
