Context:
The Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience project is a community-based program to improve disaster resilience. We collected baseline measures of resilience-related attitudes and practices among targeted communities prior to the implementation of the intervention.


Objectives:
This study identified community disaster resilience behavior patterns and assessed their associations with sociodemographic and social cognitive characteristics.


Design:
Telephone surveys during summer 2013.


Setting:
Sixteen communities in Los Angeles County (2 per service planning area).


Participants:
The address-based sample of adults (â‰¥18) was selected to be representative of 2010 census tracts in each of the communities


Main Outcome Measures:
We examined relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, social cognitive factors, and participation in community disaster resilience activities.


Results:
Three clusters of community resilience behavior patterns emerged. Cluster distribution significantly differed across several sociodemographic and social cognitive factors. Participants who were African American, Hispanic, had higher education, income, self-efficacy, trust in the public health department, civic engagement, and social capital were significantly associated with being in the cluster most active in resilience-building activities.


Conclusions:
The results confirm that there are distinct community resilience behavior patterns. These patterns vary according to population characteristics, which supports audience segmentation approaches and developing a range of emergency preparedness programs targeted to the strengths and weaknesses of the different audience segments.
