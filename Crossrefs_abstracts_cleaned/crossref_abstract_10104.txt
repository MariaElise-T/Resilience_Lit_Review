For the production of Pinus brutia seedlings resilient to dry climatic conditions of Mediterranean ecosystems and better adapted to climatic change, the laboratory of Forest Soil seedlings of P. brutia on the first year of their growth, replanted in bigger sized plastic pots. As fulfilled material used forest soil from 90% gneiss rock and 10% from different low-cost materials like cow manure, goat manure, forest floor of broadleaved forests and Calabrian pine. The research was conducted to the greenhouse of the Laboratory of Forest Soils. To evaluate the results the development of the seedlings and conciseness of different nutrients were measured. The measurements were analyzed with One Way Anova test and the results indicate the soil substrate most suitable for the production of second year Calabrian pine seedlings with greater probability of survival in dry climate conditions.
