(1) Background: With the economic development and population change, the unique village ecological structure in plain and lake areas is facing various threats. This study aims to explore ways to increase the stability of the rural ecological space and promote the construction and development of green and livable villages from the perspective of spatial resilience. (2) Method: The framework for the assessment of spatial resilience for villages was constructed, the spatial resilience characteristics in Qing Yanggang were analyzed through a field investigation and qualitative analysis, and a spatial resilience planning path for the village in river and lake areas was established. (3) Results: By integrating the natural and artificial elements in rural space, the rural spatial resilience planning can reduce the sensitivity, vulnerability and potential risks of rural areas, which is an important strategy to improve rural sustainable development. (4) Conclusions: For rural areas in plain and lake areas, it is important to optimize rural land use structures, divide rural ecological resilience zones, establish ecological zoning control systems, implement water system connectivity, improve water system patterns to achieve ecological restoration, and implement the adaptive cycle of rural water ecosystem to form a rural spatial resilience planning model. In this way, the Goals n.6 of “Provide Water and Sanitation” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be achieved at the rural scale.
