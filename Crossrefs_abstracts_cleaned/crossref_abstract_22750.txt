AbstractAimTo present a study protocol for evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of an individual face‐to‐face intervention based on protective factors to improve resilience among breast cancer patients.BackgroundResearch involving the effectiveness of universal interventions to improve resilience for breast cancer patients has seldom been reported and there is an urgent need to find a more acceptable, cost‐effective method of providing emotional support. Through health education and psychological interventions, increasing protective factors could promote recovery to the original condition and improve resilience.DesignA randomized controlled trial of an individual face‐to‐face intervention.MethodsA total of 160 adults diagnosed with confirmed breast cancer will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to the control group (N = 80) or the intervention group (N = 80). An intervention focusing on protective factors will be implemented in the intervention group. A survey of the patients from the two groups will be conducted at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is resilience, measured by the 14‐item Resilience Scale. Secondary outcomes include self‐efficacy, optimism, perceived social support, and mastery. The Chinese versions of the General Self‐Efficacy Scale, revised Life Orientation Test, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and Self‐Mastery Scale will be used to measure the four protective factors.ImpactOne‐to‐one and face‐to‐face interventions have many potential advantages for inpatients, including convenience, accessibility and individuality. Once its effectiveness is confirmed, the intervention will be implemented broadly and make support available for a large number of patients.
