Background: The mental health of students in higher education, particularly concerning suicidal ideation, has been an area of growing concern. Academic resilience and psychological well-being are key factors that influence students' mental health. Understanding the relationship between these factors is crucial for developing effective interventions.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between academic resilience, psychological well-being, and suicidal ideation among medical and non-medical students. The study sought to determine whether academic resilience serves as a protective factor against suicidal thoughts and how it interacts with psychological well-being.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 200 students, evenly divided between genders and educational backgrounds (medical and non-medical). The study employed the Academic Resilience Scale, the Psychological Well-Being Scale, and the Suicidal Ideation Scale. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 25 years, with an average age of 21.35 years. Statistical analyses included correlation, regression, and t-tests, using tools like SPSS version 25 for data processing.
Results: The results indicated a positive correlation between academic resilience and psychological well-being (r=0.242, p<0.01). Regression analysis showed that academic resilience (β=-0.59, p<0.000) and psychological well-being (β=0.49, p<0.000) were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. Medical students demonstrated higher academic resilience and lower suicidal ideation compared to non-medical students. Suicidal ideation scores among non-medical students were notably higher (Mean=125.63, SD=20.07) than medical students (Mean=107.30, SD=29.86).
Conclusion: Academic resilience plays a crucial role in reducing suicidal ideation among students. Enhancing academic resilience, particularly among non-medical students, could be a key strategy in mitigating the risk of suicidal thoughts. This study highlights the importance of incorporating resilience-building initiatives in educational settings to improve student mental health.
