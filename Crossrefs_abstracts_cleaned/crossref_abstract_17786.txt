Abstract
In this paper, a coordinated scheduling model is proposed, which provides resilience enhancement for the district integrated energy system (DIES) against extreme events. The innovation of this model is to divide scheduling into three stages. In the normal scheduling, the objective is to minimize the operation costs until a disaster alert occurs. In the proactive scheduling, the objective is to maximize the stored energy for supplying post-disaster load demand. In the resilient scheduling, the objective is to minimize the amount of load shedding. Moreover, the time of disaster alert, disaster disruption and system recovery are uncertain. Hence, according to the intensity of disasters, the results of the proposed coordinated scheduling are analysed by three disaster scenarios. The scheduling is established by optimizing the model, which is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming. Finally, it is verified that the coordinated scheduling model proposed can effectively enhance resilience of DIES by case studies.
