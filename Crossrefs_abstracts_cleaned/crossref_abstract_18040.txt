Abstract This quantitative and cross-sectional study aimed to describe and associate the levels of resilience, parenting stress and multidimensional poverty of poor families living in the city of Bel√©m (PA). The probabilistic sample consisted of 429 caregivers, interviewed in Social Assistance Reference Centers, where the application of instruments to access socio-demographic information, family resilience, parenting stress and poverty was carried out, in order to investigateprotection and risk processes for development. The sample consisted of women (97%) between 20 and 39 years (69%). This study showed associations between low resilience, high parenting stress and higher level of poverty. None of the families had high resilience scores. These results point to aspects regulating family dynamics as crucial in the healthy development of these families in relation to risk exposure.
