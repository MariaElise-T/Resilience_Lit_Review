This qualitative study aimed to explore the psychological resilience of undergraduate nursing students partaking in a virtual practicum during the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Taiwan. The virtual practicum, a form of online learning, creates challenges compared to the traditional teaching–learning experience of an actual clinical placement. Exploring how students overcome learning difficulties and build resilience is necessary for a new learning environment or for future online learning. Constructivist grounded theory and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist were followed. Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 18 student nurses for data saturation. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted individually to collect data. Initial, focused, and theoretical coding and constant comparative data analysis were performed. Credibility, originality, resonance, and usefulness guided the assessment of the study’s quality. The core category of psychological resilience in the virtual practicum was constructed to reflect Taiwanese nursing students’ progress and experiences of learning during the virtual practicum. This core category consisted of three subcategories: (i) learning difficulties within one’s inner self; (ii) staying positive and confident; and (iii) knowing what is possible. The findings identified psychological resilience as an important factor for students to adjust to the adverse experiences of a rapidly changing learning environment, such as the virtual practicum. The substantive theory of psychological resilience provided a frame of reference for coping with possible future difficulties. Correspondingly, psychological resilience reflected individuals’ potential characteristics and may help students to enter and remain in the nursing profession.
