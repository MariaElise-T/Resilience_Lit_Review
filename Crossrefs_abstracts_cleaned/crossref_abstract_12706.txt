The experiences of coping with adversities among nine Latinx adult participants (six females, three males) who self-identified as ethnically mixed were explored through semi-structured, individual interviews. Participants identified a range of challenges related to their mixed identity status, including experiences of discrimination and instances of identity conflict. Participants specified methods of overcoming challenges they faced as mixed individuals including seeking cultural commonalities, finding strength and pride within their cultures, exercising acceptance, and emphasizing aspects of oneself depending on contexts and circumstances. Finally, participants discussed resilience related growth experiences related to their mixed identity characterized by improved relationships and self-esteem. The findings provide detailed information about resilience for these mixed Latinx individuals that may be helpful in better understanding and serving others who identify similarly.
