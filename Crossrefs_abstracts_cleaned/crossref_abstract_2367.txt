Teais one of the most significant plantation crops to be emphasized towards research on development for climate-resilient variants that suits across different climate crisisimpacted countries including India. Recent tea genome research advancements eased our thoughts to begin, and apply that addresses biotic, abiotic stresses and productivity. Though the effect of climate change with unpredictable weather conditions on tea cropâ€™s resistance is unclear, DNA based and genomics-assisted breeding techniques might play prominent role in facing future challenges of crop improving set-ups. Transgene based technological advancements and molecular breeding strategies have simplified the progress of elite tea genotypes with robust adaptation to climate change and the genomics-assisted breeding strategies in specific, found to play a substantial part in the advance of climate resilient tea crops. In this review, we briefed the signs of progress in tea genome-based research and their further perspectives needed to address the current challenges we face due to the climate crisis that resolve to breed for the water-stress-tolerant tea plant.
