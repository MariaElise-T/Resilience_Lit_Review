ABSTRACT The ability to recover from disruptions is important for organizations and supply chains. Empirical data were used to investigate factors that affect supply chain recovery from disruptions, including collaboration, visibility, flexibility, analytical orientation, and supply chain risk management. A literature review was conducted to build an online questionnaire that was applied to manufacturing firms in Brazil. This workâ€™s statistical method includes confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that a package of resilience capabilities - collaboration, flexibility, visibility, and analytical orientation - positively affect supply chain resilience. Improving such capabilities, therefore, will allow supply chains to recover better from disruptions. It was also discovered, however, that supply chains do not recover from disruptions by way of supply chain risk management alone. Mutual impacts also exist between the group of resilience capabilities and supply chain risk management.
