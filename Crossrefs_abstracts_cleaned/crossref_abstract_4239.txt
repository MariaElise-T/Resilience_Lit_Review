Abstract
The present study investigates the effects of late sign language exposure on narrative development in Turkish Sign
                    Language (TİD) by focusing on the introductions of main characters and the linguistic strategies used in these introductions. We
                    study these domains by comparing narrations produced by native and late signers in TİD. The results of our study reveal that late
                    sign language exposure does not hinder the acquisition of linguistic devices to introduce main characters in narrations. Thus, their
                    acquisition seems to be resilient to the effects of late language exposure. Our study further suggests that a two-year exposure to
                    sign language facilitates the acquisition of these skills in signing children even in the case of late language exposure, thus
                    providing further support for the importance of sign language exposure to develop linguistic skills for signing children.
