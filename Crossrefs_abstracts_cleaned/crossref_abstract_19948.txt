 Few studies have explored potential associations between polyvictimization and cybervictimization and even fewer have involved in college-age sample. As it has been shown in the literature, polyvictimization is associated with higher psychological distress and lower resilience. This study is aimed to model the association between polyvictimization and cybervictimization by testing the mediating role of psychological distress and resilience. The sample included 4,626 undergraduates from France. Participants completed questionnaires assessing cybervictimization, polyvictimization (emotional abuse from parents, exposure to interparental violence, parental neglect, unwanted sexual touching, and unwanted sexual intercourse), psychological distress, and resilience. Results show that each form of victimization considered was significantly associated with cybervictimization. Also, polyvictimized participants presented higher prevalence of cybervictimization. The association between polyvictimization and cybervictimization was partially mediated positively by psychological distress and negatively by resilience. In fact, more cybervictimization was observed among polyvictimized participants with a high score of psychological distress, whereas fewer cybervictimization was observed in those with a high score of resilience. This study provides a new understanding of the mechanisms involved in cybervictimization that can help to better prevent and intervene with victims. Our results suggest that mental health professionals should assess childhood experiences of victimization when they are working with cybervictims. They also suggest the need for mental health professionals to help both polyvictimized and cybervictimized youth to develop resilience skills and coping strategies.
