 This theoretical exploration describes the social and technical features that, together, play a role in the resilience of deviant ideas in contemporary society. It argues, specifically, that two distinct but inter-related spherical processes together contribute to the social persistency of deviant information. The first of these spherical phenomena relates to the fragmentation of the dominant public discussion sphere. The second spherical process of interest relates to information spheres, and specifically as it pertains to a widening of the sphere of legitimate controversy (i.e., the society-wide determination that a topic or object of conversation is worthy of debate). This article argues that these two spherical entities—the constellation of dominate and counter discussion spheres and the information sphere—have a mutualistic and interactive relationship with one another, and that understanding this relationship provides critical insight into the social resilience of deviant information.
