This study presents an innovative approach to measuring economic resilience at a sectoral level. The notion of economic resilience is explored through the lens of levels of resilience of the main functions of a researched economic sector. The overall level of sectoral economic resilience is seen as a weighted sum of resilience indexes related to its main economic functions. Such a comprehensive approach is universal, as it allows to measure economic resilience of various economic sectors. For the empirical application, the agricultural sector of Lithuania was selected for analysis of resilience. The results revealed that the overall level of resilience declined in Lithuanian agricultural sector during 2012â€“2019. Such a persistent trend may pose an increasing risk for food security in Lithuania in the future. The most evident negative changes in the economic resilience levels are observed in terms of economic viability of farms. The most robust levels of economic resilience are indicated in the sense of ability to provide local food at affordable prices.
