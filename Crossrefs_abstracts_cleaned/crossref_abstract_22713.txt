‘Resilience’ is a new concept in the research and application of urban construction. From the perspective of building adaptability in a mountainous environment and maintaining safety performance over time, this paper innovatively proposes machine learning methods for evaluating the resilience of buildings in a mountainous area. Firstly, after considering the comprehensive effects of geographical and geological conditions, meteorological and hydrological factors, environmental factors and building factors, the database of building resilience evaluation models in a mountainous area is constructed. Then, machine learning methods such as random forest and support vector machine are used to complete model training and optimization. Finally, the test data are substituted into models, and the models’ effects are verified by the confusion matrix. The results show the following: (1) Twelve dominant impact factors are screened. (2) Through the screening of dominant factors, the models are comprehensively optimized. (3) The accuracy of the optimization models based on random forest and support vector machine are both 97.4%, and the F1 scores are greater than 94.4%. Resilience has important implications for risk prevention and the control of buildings in a mountainous environment.
