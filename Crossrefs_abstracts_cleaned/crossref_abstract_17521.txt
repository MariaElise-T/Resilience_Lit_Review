 The current study examined the relations among self-concept, career calling, resilience, and work readiness in a Malaysian sample of vocational college students ( N = 674). As hypothesized, self-concept was positively associated with work readiness. To explain this relation further, we examined the indirect effect of self-concept through calling and resilience on work readiness. Using structural equation modeling, both career calling and resilience were found to be significant avenues through which self-concept influences work readiness. Results of the indirect effects also indicated that resilience was a stronger pathway compared to career calling. These results suggest that for vocational college students, a more crystallized self-concept may link to greater work readiness skills due, in part, to a heightened sense of resilience and clarity in oneâ€™s career calling.
