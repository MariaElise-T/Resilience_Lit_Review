High-tech SMEs are the new drivers of economic growth and innovation development. The complex and turbulent operating environment of the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) era poses a serious threat to high-tech SME sustainability. Although studies have explored the factors influencing high-tech SME resilience, the equivalent effects of different combinations of factors on organizational resilience have yet to be considered. Based on the resources–capabilities–environment perspective, this study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the driving paths of high-tech SME resilience. The configuration effects of financial and relationship resources, managerial abilities, innovation capabilities, the market environment, and government interventions on the organizational resilience of high-tech SMEs are examined, and a robustness test is passed. The results show the following: (1) high-tech SME resilience is affected by multiple factors; (2) high-tech SMEs have three high-resilience driving paths—resource–capability, resource–capability–environment, and resource–environment—and two non-high-resilience driving paths—resource–capability inhibition and resource–environment inhibition; and (3) the high and non-high resilience paths are asymmetric. Theoretically, the formation of organizational resilience is a complex nonlinear process with limited single condition effects on outcomes. This study explores the impact of the interaction of multiple factors on organizational resilience, reveals the multiple driving paths of high-tech SME resilience, and enriches the theoretical study of organizational resilience. Practically, this study helps managers identify the combined effects of “resource–capability–environment” perspectives on high-tech SMEs’ resilience and provides intellectual support for them to achieve sustainable development and enhance resilience.
