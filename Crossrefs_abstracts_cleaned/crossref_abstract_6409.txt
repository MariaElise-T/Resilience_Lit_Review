 The majority of roadways in the United States are low volume. Pavement structures for low-volume roads (LVRs) are designed according to empirical procedures that are sometimes verified by a mechanistic-based design process. The flexible pavement structure for an LVR consists of a relatively thin asphaltâ€“concrete wearing course and an aggregate base course constructed on subgrade. An asphalt wearing course provides a good riding surface and moisture protection for the base course. Service life of a thin asphalt pavement depends on material quality and thickness of granular layers. A compelling need now exists for reducing the cost of building and maintaining the national transportation infrastructure. The limited lifespan of most construction materials due to continuing wear and tear requires more creative, innovative, economical, and sustainable roadway design techniques. Geogrid reinforcements in LVRs are seen as a particularly promising solution because they can be designed to provide an equivalent service life through use of less material. The combination of the aggregate and geogrid materials creates an improved or mechanically stabilized layer (MSL) with a significantly increased resilient modulus. The objective of this study was to use existing testing protocol to determine and to evaluate material design parameters for an unbound and a geogrid MSL. To determine the effects of an MSL, a test combination that included AASHTO T307 and NCHRP 598 was conducted on both unbound and mechanically stabilized aggregate specimens.
