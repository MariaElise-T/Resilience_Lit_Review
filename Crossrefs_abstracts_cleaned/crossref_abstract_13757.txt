Background:
Resilience is a phenomenon known to buffer the negative effects of stress. Resilience is important in the lives of nursing students and nurse educators.


Method:
An integrative literature review was conducted to explore the current state of knowledge of resilience in the context of nursing education. Implications from the review findings were deduced for nursing education practice and research.


Results:
Three theoretical papers and 16 empirical reports were included in the review. Three themes emerged from the analysis: (a) Resilience Is Important in Nursing Education, (b) Resilience Is Conceptualized as Either a Trait or a Process, and (c) Resilience Is Related to Protective Factors.


Conclusion:

              The findings provide data to support interventions to enhance the resilience of nursing students and nurse educators and offer a foundation for further research of resilience in nursing education. [
