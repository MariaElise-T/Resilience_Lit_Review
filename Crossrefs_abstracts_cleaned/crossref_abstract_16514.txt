Background: We aimed to verify the structural relationship between sports participation, ego-resilience, and healthpromoting behavior of Korean adolescents in a pandemic situation.
Methods: In Nov 2020, an online survey was conducted with 751 adolescents in Korea. The data obtained through the survey were analyzed in several ways, including frequency, reliability, confirmatory factor, descriptive statistical, and path analyses.
Results: Sports participation had a positive effect on ego-resilience and health-promoting behavior, while egoresilience has a positive effect on health-promoting behavior. Overall, sports participation directly affects healthpromoting behavior and that an indirect effect occurs through ego-resilience.
Conclusion: Educational institutions such as schools and the Korea Offices of Education should devise various measures so that adolescents growing up in a global pandemic situation can strengthen their health-promoting behavior by securing ego-resilience through participation in various sports.
