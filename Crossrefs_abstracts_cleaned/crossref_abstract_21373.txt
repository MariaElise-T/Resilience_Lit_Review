Objective. Analysis of the family resilience as its systemic characteristics from the standpoint of the organizational theory of A.A. Bogdanov. 
Background. The growing uncertainty of the existence of a person and a family makes such a quality as resilience in demand. The approach to the family as a system and practical work with it from the perspective of studying its resilience presupposes an emphasis not on the weakness and dysfunctionality of the family, but on those potential and real possibilities that are inherent in it. The family resilience as its systemic characteristic, depends on the balance of risk and protective factors, in the quality of which the familyâ€™s resources are considered. Family resourses are indicators of the family resilience. The resources of the nuclear family, contributing to the formation and maintenance of its resilience in wide temporal, social and cultural contexts, are gradually uniting individual resources. The process of forming the resource capacity of the family is not only their accumulation, but also the synthesis and grouping of the resources of the whole family as a system. 
Methodology. Organizational theory A.A. Bogdanov. 
Conclusions. Organizational theory A.A. Bogdanova, being a general scientific approach to the study of any system, makes it possible to analyze the family resilience as its systemic characteristics from the standpoint of the interaction of multidirectional activities mediated by differences in the understanding of family values, communication needs and organizational patterns. The joint coordinated activity of family members, leading to an increase in family resilience, is achieved with the help of certain resources.
