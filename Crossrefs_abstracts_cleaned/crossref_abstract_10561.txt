Abstract
In light of the evolving post-COVID-19 global development agenda, this article delves into the conceptualization of resilience within the creative economy as portrayed in public discourse. Using media analysis, the article scrutinizes discourse patterns evident in Jawa Pos, Indonesiaâ€™s premier media outlet, from 2020 to 2021. The insights presented are corroborated by a comprehensive literature review and an examination of official government reports. This study examines seven creative industries that dominated public discourse during the pandemic: games, software applications, film, video production, art performance, culinary arts, and crafts. Digital platforms have invigorated sectors such as gaming, culinary arts, crafts, and video content; furthermore, local tourism initiatives have been instrumental in catalysing economic rejuvenation in areas such as the culinary arts, crafts, and art performance. This analysis encourages further studies on the resilience of the creative economy.
