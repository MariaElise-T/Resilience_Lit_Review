Introduction: This study used phenomenological qualitative research design to understand the primary psychosocial stressors American Indian (AI) women face during pregnancy—factors that may be overlooked as contributing to the community’s heightened preterm birth rate—and to identify mechanisms of resilience. Method: Using Lakota talking circles (TCs) as the data collection method, researchers collected young mothers’ and tribal elders’ narratives about pregnancy and parenting. Themes were derived and verified from the transcripts. Results: During the TCs, the women identified transgenerational/historical trauma and instability in housing, childcare, and relationships as major contributors to pregnancy and parenting stress. Discussion: Having overcome obstacles while bearing and raising children, AI women exhibit resilience. Participants indicated that the TCs provided support and a cultural connection, thus serving as both a data collection method and an intervention. Future work will involve using TCs to support young mothers, transmit elder wisdom, and increase resilience among AI women.
