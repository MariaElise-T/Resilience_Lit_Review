The paper presents a framework for considering resilience as an integrated aspect in the design of manufacturing systems. The framework comprises methods for the assessment of resilience, supply chain and production planning, flexible execution and control as well as modular and skill-based methods for automation systems. A basic classification of risk categories and their impacts on manufacturing environments is given so that a concept of reconfigurable and robust production systems can be derived. Based on this, main characteristics and concepts of resilience are applied to manufacturing systems. As a lever of increased resilience on business and supply chain level, options for synchronized production planning are presented in a discrete event simulation. Furthermore, a concept to increase resilience on the level of business process execution is investigated, allowing manufacturing tasks to be rescheduled during runtime using a declarative approach to amend conventional business process models.
