IntroductionResilience is the ability to bounce back or cope successfully with stress. Fostering resilience is a promising way to mitigate the negative effects of stressors and prevent burnout.ObjectivesStudy the level of resilience among Tunisian medical interns and residents.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study between March 1 and April 15, 2021. Medical interns and residents were invited to complete an online self-questionnaire. We used the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) to assess the level of resilience.ResultsThe total number of participants was 56 of which 28.6% were male. The average age was 26.76±2.52 years. Most of the students had studied at the Faculty of Medicine in Sfax, 58.9%. 64.3% of the participants were residents, 55.4% of them in a medical specialty. 75% of participants were working in a medical department. The average years of practice was 2.27±1.23. The number of working hours per week exceeding 40 hours was found in 60.7% of participants. The number of shifts per month exceeding 4 shifts was found in 67.9%. 46.4% of the participants wanted to change their profession and 44.6% regretted choosing medicine. The mean score by BRS was 2.79±0.48. The level of resilience was high in 42.9% of the participants and normal in the rest of the respondents.ConclusionsThe level of resilience was normal to high in Tunisian medical interns and residents.
