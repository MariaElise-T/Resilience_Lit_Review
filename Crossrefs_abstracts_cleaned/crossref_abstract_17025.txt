With the rapid development of the economy and society in recent years, the ecological environment has deteriorated significantly. The governments at all levels, departments, and relevant scholars have begun to pay attention to urban ecological construction and research on urban disaster prevention and mitigation. The concept of resilience has gained widespread attention in this context. However, at present, urban ecological resilience research is still in its infancy, and there are many qualitative but few quantitative studies in terms of assessment methods. This study explores the complex dynamic evolution mechanism of urban ecosystem resilience based on the three resilience characteristics and selects Nanchang, an important ecological barrier in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and a model area for integrated management of the Great Lakes basin, as an assessment target. This study establishes a quantitative measurement and evaluation framework for urban ecological resilience in three dimensions (resistance, adaptation, and vitality) and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of urban ecosystem resilience. The results show that the trend of land-use change from 1990 to 2020 is mainly characterized by the continuous decrease in arable land and ecological land (forestland, grassland, and water) and the continuous increase in construction land, among which the land-use dynamic attitude of construction land is the largest, reaching 5.33% from 1990 to 2005. During the study period, the overall ecosystem resilience of Nanchang showed a gradual decline and was always at a moderate-to-low level, with a long-term distribution pattern of “low in the middle and high in the surrounding areas” and clear spatial heterogeneity. This study helps clarify the security status of the regional ecosystem and provides a reference for exploring the complex dynamic evolution mechanism of ecological resilience.
