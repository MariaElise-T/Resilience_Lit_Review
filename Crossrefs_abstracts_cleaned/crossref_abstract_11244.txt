Extreme weather events, sea level rise and intensified tsunamis as causes of climate change are becoming major threats for coastal cities. Istanbul, one of the most populated built-up coastal cities in the world, is prone to urban, coastal, and riverine flooding according to studies. Spatial design measurements preparing the urban waterfronts for the consequences of hazardous flooding are adopted in several cities as part of their urban resilience strategies. This paper focuses on physical measurements to adapt Istanbul to the effects of coastal flooding that is neglected so far in urban agenda. In this regard, the paper aims to develop site specific spatial design proposals as possible measurements to increase Istanbul’s waterfronts capacity for an effective flood resilience approach in case of storm events and tsunami intensified through climate change. To achieve this, status analysis and spatial configuration of possible design measures for Istanbul waterfront in a representative study area at neighborhood scale are introduced. To answer how much the waterfronts are at risk and how spatially adaptive strategies can be implemented in the current situation following flood resilience approach, site specific spatial analysis and a strategic design framework are developed. Since a comprehensive district-based guideline for spatial adaptation is currently not embedded in the urban agenda of flood management in Istanbul, this study promotes preparation of multiple guidelines adopting contemporary design measures in flood management for the entire city’s waterfronts by proposing one for Kadiköy.
