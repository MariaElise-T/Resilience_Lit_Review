This study examined the experienced impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the resilience, art activities, and income among performance and visual artists in a low- to middle-income country, including the relationship between resilience and art activities. Practicing artists in South Africa with a tertiary qualification in visual or performance art were recruited through social media platforms. Amid the pandemic, 109 participants completed a questionnaire that incorporated the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, income variables before and during the pandemic, 26 art activity items that captured the experienced impact of the pandemic on their commitment, productivity, social connection and engagement, financial implications, and changes in their art activities. The results revealed that the resilience of participants decreased significantly during the pandemic (t-test = 7.631; p < 0.001), whereas no relationship was found between resilience preceding the pandemic and changes in art activities. Higher resilience scores during the pandemic were associated with being more productive (&beta; = 0.244, t = 2.56, p = 0.012), stimulated in commitment (&beta; = 0.263, t = 2.796, p = 0.006), and less inhibited (&beta; = &minus;0.552 &ndash; &minus;0.541, t = &minus;6.749 &minus; &minus;6.594, p < 0.001) in art activities. The income of participants decreased significantly during the pandemic (Fisher&rsquo;s exact test = 98.193; p < 0.001), causing apprehension in art activities, especially for those who were less resilient (&beta; = &minus;0.306, t = &minus;3.314, p < 0.001), and the situation was compounded by being self-employed (p = 0.003). Despite decreased resilience and loss of financial income during the pandemic, participating artists in South Africa explored new ways of doing their art, were stimulated in their commitment, and sought social connections in their art activities.
