Abstract
Increasing interdependencies between power and ICT systems amplify the possibility of cascading failures. Resilience against such failures is an essential property of modern and sustainable power systems and networks. To assess the resilience and predict the behaviour of a system consisting of interdependent subsystems, the interconnection requires adequate modeling. This work presents an approach to model and determine the state of these so-called interconnectors in future cyber-physical energy systems with strongly coupled ICT and power systems for a resilience analysis. The approach can be used to capture the impact of various parameters on system performance upon suitable modification. An hierarchical modeling approach is developed with atomic models that demonstrate the interdependencies between a power and ICT system. The modeling approach using stochastic activity nets is applied to an exemplary redispatch process in a cyber-physical energy system. The performance of an interconnector when facing limited performance from the ICT subsystem and its subsequent impact on the power system is analysed using the models. The state of the interconnector, as well as the service level are mapped to a resilience state-space diagram. The representation of system state on the resilience state-space diagram allows interpretation of system performance and quantification of resilience metrics.
