Academic resilience is a critical topic that has been around for decades and contains a variety of theoretical models and research approaches. In this current study, we adopted the developmental view of resilience. We combined the person-focused (classification and trajectory) and variable-focused (regression) methods to analyze the longitudinal data of 744 students from the TDCYP 2011-2017. We conducted item response theory (IRT) models and a latent class growth modeling framework. First, we measured each personâ€™s latent trait level by IRT and simultaneously identified the classes by positive outcome (academic self-concept) and risk factors. Eventually, to explain the class membership and growth factors by adding covariates. The finding of this study as follows, (1) the four-class model was selected, and they are the competent group (17%), the resilient group (34%), the vulnerable group (31%), and the maladaptive group (18%). (2) The developmental hypothesis of academic resilience was not confirmed because the slope factors of academic self-concept and two groups of risk factors showed no significance. (3) Moreover, we found gender, mental health (illness), and teacher support play critical roles in this study, and they could explain the growth trends and even the membership classifying. The family support and poverty factors were lack of influence might due to the data properties. Importantly, this study can advise educators that it is worth further studying and practicing that school-based context on how to support a student, especially the socioeconomically disadvantaged.
