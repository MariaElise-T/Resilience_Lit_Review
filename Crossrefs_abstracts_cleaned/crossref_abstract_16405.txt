Abstract
Pandeglang Regency has the potential of a tsunami disaster due to its location, which is close to the megathrust segment of the Sunda Strait. The tsunami disaster caused negative impacts such as death, loss of property, and damage, which could be lessened by increasing community resilience aimed at reducing the disaster risk. Community resilience is related to the communityâ€™s ability to recover from shocks or pressure to its original state. A resilient community can return to its previous state relatively quickly. It is crucial to know the tsunami disaster resilience index in Pandeglang Regency to obtain recommendations or concepts for tsunami disaster mitigation that are appropriate in creating community resilience to tsunami disasters in Pandeglang Regency. The purpose of this study was to measure community resilience to the tsunami disaster in Sukarame Village, Carita District, Pandeglang Regency using The Integrated Concept of Community Resilience (ICCR), which was adjusted to the conditions of the study area. Measurement indicators are developed based on internal and external factors that affect community resilience, such as social, cultural and economic capital, disaster risk governance, and disaster-based spatial planning. The analysis is based on data from the household questionnaire, which is then transcribed into statistically analyzed indicators. The results show that the combination of the social, cultural and economic capital, as well as the disaster risk governance index is medium, while the disaster-based spatial planning index is low. The ICCR index in Sukarame Village is in the medium category. It is necessary to improve disaster risk governance and disaster-based spatial planning in this area to reduce the tsunami risk that may occur in the future.
