Resilience discourse is shifting the very meaning of “resilience” from “bouncing back” to “bouncing forward” in the twenty-first century. International policies have provoked cities to play a proactive role in applying land-use and environmental planning strategies for disaster resilience. Strategies of urban flood resilience include prevention, accommodation, fortification, protection, retreat, and green infrastructure. In general, four models of resilience against flooding are primarily adopted: the structure model, the non-structure model, the land-use and environmental planning model, and the retreat planning model. Results indicate that planning more space for the river, wetland planning, polder and retention areas, and permeable surface design do matter in reducing flood risks. Additionally, urban growth management, directing developments and populations away from floodplains, could reduce flood risks and damages. Finally, in retreat model, urban resilience stresses retreat and evacuation to reduce flood damages. Retreat strategies and alternatives, such as property buyouts, relocations, new towns for accommodations, and land swaps for less risky areas, could be applied in helping to achieve urban flood resilience.
