Global climate change and population growth are persistently posing threats to natural resources (e.g., freshwater) and agricultural production. Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) evolved from C3 photosynthesis as an adaptive form of photosynthesis in hot and arid regions. It features the nocturnal opening of stomata for CO2 assimilation, diurnal closure of stomata for water conservation, and high water-use efficiency. To cope with global climate challenges, the CAM mechanism has attracted renewed attention. Facultative CAM is a specialized form of CAM that normally employs C3 or C4 photosynthesis but can shift to CAM under stress conditions. It not only serves as a model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the CAM evolution, but also provides a plausible solution for creating stress-resilient crops with facultative CAM traits. This review mainly discusses the recent research effort in defining the C3 to CAM transition of facultative CAM plants, and highlights challenges and future directions in this important research area with great application potential.
