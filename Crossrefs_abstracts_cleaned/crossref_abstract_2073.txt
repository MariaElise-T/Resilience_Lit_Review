AbstractObjectiveThis brief report was designed to understand resilience in families 2 years after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic.BackgroundThe COVID‐19 pandemic has had well‐documented adverse effects on individuals and families. However, some studies have found null, or even positive, effects within aspects of family life. These mixed results suggest the potential for resilience in families, yet few studies have empirically investigated this possibility.MethodsA sample of 593 parents (53% female) that were married or in a romantic relationship participated in a nationwide survey in September 2022; individuals were recruited via the research survey firm Prolific. Latent profile analysis was used to identify typologies of family adjustment following the pandemic and predictors of group membership.ResultsA three‐group solution was identified, with groups labeled as stable family functioning (n = 286; 48% of the sample), improved family functioning (n = 250; 42%), and worsened family functioning (n = 57; 10%). Predictors of group membership indicated significant differences across all three groups in respondents' levels of cohesive family mindset. Select group differences were also observed in levels of couple communication, partner gratitude, perceived stress, and loneliness.ConclusionFindings provide empirical support for the occurrence of resilience in families in the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Predictors of group membership provide insights into sources of family resilience and areas to target in family‐based interventions designed to support families under stress.
