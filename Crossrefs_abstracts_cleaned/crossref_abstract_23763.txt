Climate warming in Antarctica involves major shifts in plant distribution and productivity. This study aims to unravel the plasticity and acclimation potential of Bryum argenteum var. muticum, a cosmopolitan moss species found in Antarctica. By comparing short-term, closed-top chamber warming experiments which mimic heatwaves, with in situ seasonal physiological rates from Cape Hallett, Northern Victoria Land, we provide insights into the general inherent resilience of this important Antarctic moss and into its adaptability to longer-term threats and stressors associated with climate change. Our findings show that B. argenteum can thermally acclimate to mitigate the effects of increased temperature under both seasonal changes and short-term pulse warming events. Following pulse warming, this species dramatically increased its carbon uptake, measured as net photosynthesis, while reductions in carbon losses, measured as dark respiration, were not observed. Rapid growth of new shoots may have confounded the effects on respiration. These results demonstrate the high physiological plasticity of this species, with acclimation occurring within only 7 days. We show that this Antarctic moss species appears to have a high level of resilience and that fast acclimation processes allow it to potentially benefit from both short-term and long-term climatic changes.
