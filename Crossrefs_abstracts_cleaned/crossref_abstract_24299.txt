AbstractThe spleen is a large immune organ that plays a key role in the immune system. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between the spleen and stress-related psychiatric disorders are unknown. Here we investigated the role of spleen in stress-related psychiatric disorders. FACS analysis was applied to determine the contribution of the spleen to susceptibility and resilience in mice that were subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). We found a notable increase in splenic volume and weight in CSDS-susceptible mice compared to control (no CSDS) mice and CSDS-resilient mice. The number of granulocytes, but not of T cells and B cells, in the spleen of susceptible mice was higher than in the spleen of both control and resilient mice. Interestingly, NKG2D (natural killer group 2, member D) expression in the spleen of CSDS-susceptible mice was higher than that in control mice and CSDS-resilient mice. In addition, NKG2D expression in the spleen of patients with depression was higher than that in controls. Both increased splenic weight and increased splenic NKG2D expression in CSDS-susceptible mice were ameliorated after a subsequent administration of (R)-ketamine. The present findings indicate a novel role of splenic NKG2D in stress susceptibility versus resilience in mice subjected to CSDS. Furthermore, abnormalities in splenic functions in CSDS-susceptible mice were ameliorated after subsequent injection of (R)-ketamine. Thus, the brainâ€“spleen axis might, at least in part, contribute to the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression.
