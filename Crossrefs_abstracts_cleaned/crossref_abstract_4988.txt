AbstractAn adequate charging infrastructure is key to enabling high personal electric vehicle (EV) adoption rates. However, urban flooding—whose frequency and intensity are increasing due to climate change—may be an impediment. Here, we study how geographically-correlated outages due to floods impact public EV charging networks in Greater London. While we find no appreciable impact on the ability of battery EVs to serve typical urban driving behaviors, we observe disproportionate stresses on chargers both near, and surprisingly significantly farther from, the flooded regions. For instance, we find over 50% increase in charger utilization and 260% increase in the distance to the nearest available charger in parts of Greater London over 10 km away. Concerningly, the impact is most concentrated on already-stressed sections of the network, underscoring the infrastructure’s vulnerability. Finally, we develop and evaluate four strategies for city planners to enhance the flood resilience of cities’ public EV charging networks.
