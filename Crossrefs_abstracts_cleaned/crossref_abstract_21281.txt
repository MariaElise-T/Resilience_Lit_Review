Objective: To compare the health status (stress, depressive symptoms and sleep quality), the resilience and quality of life in first and fourth year nursing students.Methods: This is a cross-sectional research conducted in 2016 with 86 students enrolled in first and fourth years of the nursing degree. We applied the instrument for Assessment of Stress in Nursing Students, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Wagnild and Young’s Resilience Scale; and the WHOQOL-BREF. ANOVA (Test F) was applied for data analysis.Results and conclusions: A total of 49 first-year and 37 fourth-year students were sampled for this study. Fourth- year nursing students showed higher levels of stress, lower intensity of depressive symptoms and higher quality of life and resilience levels. The poor sleep quality was prevalent in both groups. Conclusion: although the nursing education potentially contributes for students’ sickness, the experiences lived in this period may strength the resilience skills.Conclusions: Video indexing and retrieval are accomplished by using hashing and $k$-d tree methods, while visual signatures containing color, shape and texture information are estimated for the key-frames, by using image and frequency domain techniques. Experimental results with the dataset of a multimedia information system especially developed for managing television broadcast archives demonstrate that our approach works efficiently, retrieving videos in 0.16 seconds on average and achieving recall, precision and F1 measure values, as high as 0.76, 0.97 and 0.86 respectively.
