AbstractFarmers are facing more frequent and severe droughts than they have in generations, including over this last year. By late summer 2022, nearly 40% of farmers in the U.S. had already plowed under or killed their crops. That’s because those crops stood no chance of reaching maturity and harvest due to ongoing drought. Yields in Texas, for example, were proving almost 70% below normal as severe drought gripped the region. Some 60% of the West, South, and Central Plains were experiencing severe or worse drought. It’s now the offseason for some crops and early season for others. It’s a good time to advise farmers what changes they might undertake to make their farms more resilient.
