AbstractThis study aimed to explore factors related to academic success (resilience) for students with socioeconomic disadvantages (SED) from the individual, school, and family domains. We also compared such factors with the results for students with socioeconomic advantages (SEA). A sample of 1767 eighth‐graders (851 students with SEA and 916 students with SED) from a city in northern China completed the questionnaires online. We found that (a) the common factors related to academic success for students with SED and SEA are high educational expectations, intrinsic motivation, positive parent−child relationships, and schools with high socioeconomic status; and (b) the unique factors for students with SED (but not SEA) are appropriate parental involvement with more concern in daily life but less concern in study and close peer relationships. Findings highlight social support as a protective factor against academic failure, especially among students from low‐income families.
