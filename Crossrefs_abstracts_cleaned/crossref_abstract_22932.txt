 Previous studies have shown that sleep quality is associated with risk-taking behaviors, but the psychological mechanism of this relationship is unclear among emerging adults at university. In the present study, we examined the relationship among sleep quality, resilience, and risk-taking behaviors in college students. A sample of 1221 college students (50.4% females, M age = 22.58, SD = 1.28) was enrolled in our survey. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), domain-specific risk-taking scale, and Connor–Davidson resilience scale were used to test sleep quality, risk-taking behaviors, and resilience. The results showed that PSQI scores positively correlated with risk-taking behaviors, and the poor sleep quality increased participants’ risk-taking behaviors by decreasing resilience. The findings suggested that resilience played a mediating role between sleep quality and risk-taking behaviors among college students. The relationships between sleep quality and risk-taking behaviors, and sleep quality and resilience were moderated by gender. Specifically, the association between sleep quality and resilience was greater in females than in males; however, the association between sleep quality and risk-taking behaviors was greater in males than in females. The present study revealed that prevention and intervention aimed at improving sleep are needed to enhance resilience and reduce risk-taking behaviors.
