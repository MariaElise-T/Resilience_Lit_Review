PurposeThis study aims to investigate the influence of supply chain resilience (SCR) and supply chain capabilities (SCC) on supply chain performance (SCP) through the direct and moderating influence of the degree of SCR (DSCR), as demonstrated in UAE energy industry supply chain management (SCM) processes.Design/methodology/approachUsing the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a questionnaire-survey collected 168 valid responses from UAE-based companies that operate within the energy industry. This study investigates the moderated mediation research model of the SCR, SCC and SCP with DSCR being considered as the variable having the moderation role.FindingsSCR and SCC were found to have a significant positive affect on SCP playing a mediating role in improving performance during or after a SC disruption. However, the objective was to confirm the exitance of the moderator role in DSCR to substantiate its moderated mediating effect in the research model. There was a negative moderating effect of SCR on SCP through SCC.Originality/valueThis is among the pioneer study that suggests and empirically tests the moderated mediating impacts of the SCR degree on the relationships between SCR, capability within a supply chain and its performance. An additional element of originality of this study is its relevance to the UAE energy industry and recent SC disruptions.
