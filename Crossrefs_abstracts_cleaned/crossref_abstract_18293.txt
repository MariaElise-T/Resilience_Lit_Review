In the context of global environmental changes, the frequency of various disasters and extreme events is increasing, and enhancing urban resilience has become an important guide for current urban development. Previous studies have mainly focused on changes in urban resilience, with less consideration for the impact of spatial spillover effects on urban resilience. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of urban resilience and its spatial spillover effects in Guangdong from 2012 to 2020 based on the urban resilience assessment model, the Getis-Ord Gi* model, and the improved Capello model. The results are as follows: Affected by COVID-19, the urban resilience of Guangdong Province declined from 2019 to 2020, and 42.86% of the cities demonstrated negative growth in their urban resilience. Urban resilience exhibited significant spatially non-equilibrium characteristics among different cities. The urban resilience of the cities in eastern, northern, and western Guangdong, which are the “collapse zone” of urban resilience, was lower than 0.229 from 2012 to 2020. The intensity of urban resilience spillover in Guangdong presented a typical three-level circle structure of “core-subcore-periphery”, which decreased from the core circle to the surrounding circle. COVID-19 caused a 27.21% decrease in the total urban resilience spillover in Guangdong from 2019 to 2020. Finally, we identified critical driving factors of urban resilience using the optimal-parameters geographical detector model. This study can provide a scientific reference for the Chinese government to build resilient cities and improve sustainable urban development.
