AbstractThe resilience of small businesses and how that relates to community resilience, especially in rural communities has remained an under‐researched aspect of community resilience. This exploratory study aims to understand the relationship between business resilience and community resilience in rural communities. Firstly, the research seeks to understand the role that small businesses play in contributing to community resilience activities. The paper then sheds light on enabling and challenging factors that shape how small businesses prepare for and respond to weather‐related emergencies through the lens of flooding. Data were collected through in‐depth semi‐structured interviews and surveys with rural small businesses in Scotland. The analysis of the data suggests that businesses play an advisory and advocacy roles, make financial and material contributions to local community resilience activities and contribute to quick community recovery through various dimensions of corporate social responsibility activities. However, small businesses face formidable barriers and challenges in preparing for and responding to weather‐related emergencies that undermine their resilience to natural hazards. The paper suggests ways in which small businesses can enhance their resilience to natural hazards, while at the same time contributing to community resilience.
