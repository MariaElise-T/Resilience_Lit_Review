AbstractMarginalization causes gender diverse individuals to experience increased stress compared with cisgender individuals, such as social stigma and discrimination, which can lead to poor physical and mental health outcomes. This population uses various resources to cope with these challenges, including community social support. This qualitative research aimed to understand how gender diverse individuals perceive their community resilience. Supported by a community partner organization, we recruited N = 20 gender diverse participants for semi‐structured interviews analyzed through inductive thematic qualitative analysis. The data revealed similarities with community resilience factors observed among other minority groups as well as novelty. Themes emerged on both individual and group levels and include strengths (e.g., opening to the group, role modeling for resilience, and group resources) and threats to community resilience (e.g., social anxiety, physical health conditions, and stigma). This paper informs the development of community resilience interventions in the context of gender diversity.
