The transition through university is often challenging and can negatively impact students&rsquo; mental health. Identifying protective factors and opportunities aimed at promoting students&rsquo; psychological wellbeing is therefore paramount. Maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism have been found to impact students&rsquo; psychological wellbeing. However, less is known about how sociocognitive factors such as self-efficacy and resilience impact this relationship. The current study investigated whether self-efficacy and resilience mediate the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism, adaptive perfectionism and psychological wellbeing, controlling for gender, study mode, study method and COVID-19 lockdowns. Australian university students (N = 193; 86.53% female) aged 18&ndash;66 (M = 27.80, SD = 10.45) studying full-time (68.39%) and online (72.02%) completed the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. The indirect effect of maladaptive perfectionism on psychological wellbeing through self-efficacy was significant (b = -0.09, SE = .03, 95% CI [-0.15, -0.04]). The indirect effect of adaptive perfectionism on psychological wellbeing through self-efficacy was also significant (b = 0.09, SE = .04, 95% CI [0.02, 0.18]). However, resilience did not indirectly impact the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism, adaptive perfectionism and psychological wellbeing. This study demonstrates the importance of building self-efficacy for maladaptive and adaptive perfectionist students and highlights an opportunity for universities to create self-efficacy-based programs to promote students&rsquo; psychological wellbeing.
