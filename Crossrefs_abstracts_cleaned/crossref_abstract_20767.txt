The concept of resilience, identified as a crucial variable due to its association with several beneficial outcomes in adulthood, is of particular interest in the teaching field. Specifically, teachers work in a demanding, challenging, and stressful context that requires a remarkable ability to adapt; therefore, resilience is important in the field of teaching and training, as it plays a fundamental role in children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. This study sought to analyze the psychometric properties of the SV-RES60 Resilience Scale in a sample of Chilean elementary school teachers from first to eighth grade (N = 1406; mean age = 41.4; SD = 10.8). ESEM and bifactor ESEM analyses were performed to evaluate its factor structure, internal consistency, and reliability. The results supported a bifactor structure in which resilience was represented by one general latent factor and twelve specific factors (RMSEA = 0.032; 90%CI [0.030, 0.033]; SRMR = 0.012; CFI = 0.986; TLI = 0.977). A predominance of the unidimensional components of the SV-RES60 (general factor, ECV = 0.812; ωh = 0.975) and a high reliability (α = 0.981; ω of the general factor = 0.991) were observed. In conclusion, the SV-RES60 Resilience Scale is a suitable instrument for measuring the general factor of resilience in the investigated teaching environment. Future studies could contribute towards evidence of a reduced scale and transcultural validation to conduct comparative studies.
