Objective As the greatest global challenge of our time, climate change is not only an ecological crisis but also a humanitarian one. Climate action is a defining opportunity to not only collectively mend ecological health and biodiversity but also to advance psychosocial resilience and social cohesion. This essay aims to understand the interconnectedness between climate change and mental health, as well as explore ways in which this can be transformed into a mobilising force. Conclusions The ramifications of climate change on mental health are complex, and there continues to be expanding knowledge on this through research undertaken out of heightening urgency. With knowledge of this, global recovery will require meaningful and transformative action that addresses the interconnection between climate change, mental health, and social injustice.
