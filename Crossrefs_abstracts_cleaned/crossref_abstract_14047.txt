 The study proposes to understand the dynamics of work stress and turnover relationship of physicians in Indian context. It also intends to understand the mediating and moderating roles of burnout and resilience on the relationship between work stress and turnover intentions. The article has taken the support of conservation of resources (COR) theory to develop the conceptual framework. The study uses the survey method for data collection which was analysed using quantitative statistical methods like confirmatory factor analysis and mediated and moderated regression. The result showed a significant moderating effect of resilience on burnout and turnover intentions relationship and a strong mediating effect of burnout on the relationship between stress and turnover intentions. Physicians who are regarded as ‘saviours’ should be treated with respect. Certain activities dealing with work–life balance, engaging in leisure activities, getting support from family and friends may help the physician in coping with the demands of stress and thereby reducing the burnout. Future research can take into account other states of India as well as other countries for generalisation of results. The demographic differences among the physicians can also be a new area of research. Although there is lot of available research on the study variables, but none of the studies have taken into context resilience as a moderator between burnout and turnover intention specially in reference to Indian context. The results can add value to the prevailing studies on stress, burnout, resilience and turnover intention.
