Of the 27.2% nurses who showed moderate or higher levels of depression. Nurses' work experiences in a COVID-19 unit had a direct effect on depression and indirectly affected depression via resilience as a mediator. Resilience had a partial mediation effect, and organizational trust had a significant moderated mediation effect in the path from nurses' work experiences in a COVID-19 unit to depression mediated by resilience.ConclusionsThis study emphasizes the key role that healthcare organizations play in providing sufficient support to nursing staff to protect them from depression by improving nurses' resilience and organizational trust during the pandemic. Healthcare organizations need to develop a systematic structure to provide organizational support to nurses so that the organizational trust and resilience of nurses can be maximized.
