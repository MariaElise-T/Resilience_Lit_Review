AbstractResilience is ubiquitous in everyday speech, academic literature and governmental policies. Yet it seems to have taken a narrow scope in healthcare, confined to individual and psychological resilience. This short essay aims to broaden the understanding of resilience to organisational levels and calls intensivists to take active roles in fostering resilience for their staff. The article explores firstly the background and etymology of resilience. It then challenges current approaches and briefly signposts some current work in the area. Some examples of structural factors which build individual resilience are listed, followed by a call for intensivists to take active roles to build future resilience. The need for interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral and multi-level approaches is vital to build future healthcare resilience, and we intensivists must continue to be advocates for systemic change.
