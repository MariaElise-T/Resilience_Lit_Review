Purpose: To identify factors influencing health-related quality of life for young single-person households, this study investigated physical and mental health status, health behavior, depression, resilience, and health-related quality of life. Methods: An online survey was administered to members of young single-person households from March 22 to 30, 2022. The data were analyzed using the chi-square test, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficients, multiple regression, and a simple mediation model applying the PROCESS macro model 4 with 95% bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals. Results: The participants were 229 members of young single-person households. Health-related quality of life showed significant relationships with residence (t = 2.80, p = .006), monthly income (F = 3.70, p = .026), mental health status (F = 20.33, p < .001), and high-intensity exercise (F = 7.35, p = .001) among general and health-related characteristics. Health-related quality of life had significant correlations with depression (r = -.72, p < .001) and resilience (r = .58, p < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that depression (β = -.57, p < .001) and resilience (β = .21, p < .001) influenced health-related quality of life. Moreover, resilience had a mediating effect between depression and health-related quality of life (indirect effect = -0.002, 95% bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence interval = -0.003 to -0.001). Conclusion: Members of young single-person households tended to be more vulnerable to emergency situations, such as during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, when lockdowns and quarantines were frequent. To improve health-related quality of life in young single-person households, people with high levels of depression or low levels of resilience need special attention and support to promote mental health.
