Three cultivars of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), `Crimson Sweet', `Charleston Gray' and `Tri-X Seedless' were grown in combination with 4 levels of soil applied calcium (0, 280, 560, 1120 kg Ca/ha). Gypsum was incorporated into 6 m plots on 5 m centers then covered with black plastic mulch. Irrigation requirements were provided through a M-wall drip system and soil water status monitored with tensiometers. Transplants were spaced 1.2 m apart in-row spacing allowing for 5 plants per plot and replicated times. Rind tissue from mature watermelon fruit was divided into 4 sections, blossom-end, middle top, grounds spot and stem end. Each section was measured for resistance to shear and puncture by a Model T-1200-G texture and tenderometer system. Thickness was also measured. Lab determinations for total and extractable calcium on the sections was done to determine if there is a relationship between rind resiliency and calcium concentration. Data will be presented et the meeting.
