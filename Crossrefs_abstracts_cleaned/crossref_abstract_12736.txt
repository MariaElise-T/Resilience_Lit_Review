PurposeThis paper aims to examine the operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity influencing proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience and implementation in inter-organizational relationships.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a research model comprises six research hypotheses with five constructs, including trajectory, absorptive capacity, operating frontier, proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. The hypotheses are tested on data collected from 297 senior managers of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, using structural equation modeling.FindingsThe study provides insights into how supply chain members can reinforce their operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity activities to improve proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience.Research limitations/implicationsThe resultant findings cannot be generalized for all forms of supply chains, as they exclusively reflect those in Taiwan. With the research model developed, cross-industrial studies on various forms of supply chains would be worth conducting to investigate whether their inter-relationship effects differ in relation to inter-organizational supply chain resilience.Practical implicationsThis study provides multiple insights for managers and practices seeking to improve inter-organizational supply chain resilience, which have become increasingly popular because their factors enhance coping strategies to achieve corporate goals. The proactive and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience can be effectively improved by enhancing trajectory, absorptive capacity and operating frontier.Originality/valueThis empirical research attempted to fill the gaps created by trajectory and resource-based perspectives in inter-organizational supply chain resilience. This study reveals how supply chain members can reinforce the factors of their coping strategies (i.e. operating frontier, trajectory and absorptive capacity) to make significant improvements, which is not dealt with in previous studies.
