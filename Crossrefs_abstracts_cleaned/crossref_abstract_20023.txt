This discussant commentary considers the findings presented from the UCL-Penn Global COVID Study webinar ‘Let’s Talk! What do you need to recover from Covid-19?’ and published in Wong et al’s article in this journal, Reflections, Resilience, and Recovery, drawing into focus the support required to recover from the changes in people’s mental health, physical health and relationships brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the importance of not making broad generalisations about the effect of the lockdown allows us to see individuals in their own context and their own particular challenges. As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, we need to use the lessons from this study as the foundations for building resilience against future pandemics.
