This paper examines the impact of cyber resilience and supply chain (SC) robustness on supply chain performance in the UAE chemical industry. No prevailing empirical evidence makes this research unique and beneficial to the literature and future research related to cyber resilience in the chemical industry. Moreover, this research is a contemporary contribution to the research of the UAE chemical industry. The study applies a quantitative approach with causal, exploratory and analytical design. The magnitude of the industry is emphasized by choosing cluster sampling techniques. Data is collected from chemical manufacturing companies located in Abu Dhabi, UAE. A valid sample of 303 participants is used for data analysis. A positive direct impact with a significant level of cyber resilience and SC robustness on supply chain performance is found. Current hypothetical model assessment in one industry limits the research findings. It is recommended that other industries be investigated through longitudinal research. A system of diverse detection and defense mechanisms is required. For the chemical industry, an effective cyber security plan would strengthen resilience against cyberattacks and improve SC performance.
