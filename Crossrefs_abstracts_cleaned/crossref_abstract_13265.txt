 Many families are subjected to the routine separation of a family member. Business executives, sales representatives, military employees, and politicians are just a few examples of professions that require the regular separation of an individual from his/her family system. This paper describes a new occupational social work intervention that assists families in resisting the stress of separations, that is, which increases their “separation resilience.” The paper describes eight dimensions that are associated with separation resilience and introduces a one-day, multiple-couple, psychoeducational program that fosters these factors. A trial implementation of this Separation Resilience Seminar (SRS) is evaluated with regard to client satisfaction and effectiveness. Recommendations for ongoing research and development and social work practice guidelines are proposed.
