 Considering that the perturbation of controller parameters may cause severe performance deterioration in practice, this work is focused on asynchronous resilient H∞ control for discrete-time switched systems under average dwell time switching. The multiple non-monotonic Lyapunov function approach is employed to analyze the stability and H∞ performance to reduce the conservation level. First, an H∞ stability criterion is derived for general switched nonlinear systems, based on which a sufficient condition is further obtained for the resultant closed-loop system under asynchronous average dwell time switching. Then, a synthesis condition for a resilient output-feedback H∞ controller is developed using Fensler’s lemma. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controller design method are demonstrated by two simulated examples.
