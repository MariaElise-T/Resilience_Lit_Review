Abstract
Date Presented 04/22/2023
This session will discuss the outcomes of a study conducted to evaluate the test–retest reliability and internal consistency of the Occupational Resilience Measure (ORM 1.0). Results show that ORM 1.0 and its four subtests have good test–retest reliability and internal consistency. ORM 1.0 may be used in pre- and postintervention occupational resilience measurement, enabling clinicians and researchers to test the efficacy of interventions. Single measures may be used in clinical decision making.
