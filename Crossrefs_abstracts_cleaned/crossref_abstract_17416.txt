This study aimed to investigate the moderating effect of psychological resilience on sleep-deterioration-related depression among patients with prostate cancer, in terms of the total score and individual symptoms. From a survey of 96 patients with prostate cancer, 55 who reported a deterioration in their sleep quality since diagnosis and treatment completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Moderation analysis was conducted for the scale total scores and for the ‘core’ symptoms of each scale within this sample, based on data analysis. Interaction analysis was used to identify key associations. The moderation analysis suggested that psychological resilience moderated the depressive effect of sleep deterioration that patients reported occurred after their diagnosis and treatment and did so at the total and ‘core’ symptom levels of being able to see the humorous side of things and to think clearly when under pressure, but there was an interaction between this moderating effect, the strength of psychological resilience, and severity of sleep deterioration. Although it appears to be a successful moderator of depression arising from sleep deterioration that was reported by patients with prostate cancer, the effectiveness of psychological resilience is conditional upon the severity of patients’ sleep difficulties and the strength of their psychological resilience. Implications for the application of resilience training and concomitant therapies for patients with prostate cancer with sleep difficulties and depression are discussed.
