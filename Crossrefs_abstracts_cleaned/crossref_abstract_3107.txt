 We report three-pronged findings on the application of leadership and visionary capabilities to make projects resilient. The data collected through 33 qualitative interviews were analyzed using NVivo. The results show that project staff applied visionary and leadership capabilities using several means and to varying degrees. However, a sense of confusion and a lack of awareness prevail among the staff about their need to possess these capabilities. The recommendations are that both mindsets and methods need to change to develop these capabilities. Advancing project resilience literature, the findings introduce the role of leadership and visionary capabilities in building resilience.
