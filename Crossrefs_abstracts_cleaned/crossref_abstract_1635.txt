This article analyses perceptions of residents of the Seychelles in the western  Indian Ocean in relation to a long-running debate over small island developing states (SIDS)  as to whether they are vulnerable or resilient. The results of data obtained from 25 key  informant interviews and 70 household surveys conducted in 2013 showed that respondents  perceived their country to be both vulnerable and resilient. Moreover, the data revealed that  the relationship between vulnerability and resilience was complex, and that five interpretations  of that relationship were evident: conflict, compromise, complementarity, symbiosis and  transformation. Also, the conceptual distance between the two terms – vulnerability and  resilience – was shown to be closer than may be commonly assumed. Finally, the paper  questions whether the debate over vulnerability versus resilience is rightly confined to SIDS or  could be equally applied to other states.
