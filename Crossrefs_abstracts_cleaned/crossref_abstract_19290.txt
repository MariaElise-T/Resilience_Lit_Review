 Resilience refers to one’s ability to adapt and navigate through challenges in the face of a chronic illness and disability (CID). Originally reported in posttraumatic stress literature, resilience has been studied in various contexts; however, very few studies have been conducted from a virtue perspective. Virtue, in psychological terms, is consistent, everyday action toward a worthwhile pursuit, based on one’s values. From a virtue perspective, resilience is defined as a positive by-product of having endured adversities while transforming them into insightful opportunities for renewal. This article introduces the virtue-based psychosocial adaptation model (V-PAM) and its applicability to the study of resilience. College students with CID ( N = 256) were recruited, and their resilience was empirically examined based on the proposed model.
