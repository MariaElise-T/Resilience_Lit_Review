Financial Resilience is the ability to withstand and recover when faced with challenging economic conditions. This study aims to examine the influence of financial literacy, financial planning, self-efficacy, and income on the financial resilience of individuals in the quarter-life crisis phase. The research employed a quantitative approach, and data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS 3.0 software. A total of 255 respondents were obtained through purposive sampling and online questionnaires. The research findings conclude that financial literacy and financial planning positively and significantly impact financial resilience. However, self-efficacy and income do not positively influence financial resilience.
