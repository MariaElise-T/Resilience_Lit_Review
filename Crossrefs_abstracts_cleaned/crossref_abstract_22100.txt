AbstractAims and ObjectivesTo develop a conceptual framework that explores the process of building family resilience among Chinese families with children diagnosed with leukaemia.BackgroundThe diagnosis of childhood leukaemia has a devastating effect on the family. Nonetheless, some families were able to positively respond to the crisis. The process through which Chinese families bounce back has received little attention.DesignGrounded theory.MethodsThis study used purposive and theoretical sampling to select 16 parents who agreed to participate in semistructured interviews after children were diagnosed with leukaemia. Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Data were analysed through a process of open, axial and selective coding. The COREQ checklist was followed for reporting.ResultsA core category of ‘finding family resilience in adversity’ was generated. The core category was underpinned by a transition process between two fluid stages: (a) Disrupting the family system, informed by subcategories of negative emotional disturbances and challenges of the diagnosis and treatment journey; (b) Cultivating resilience in families, informed by subcategories of increasing positive attitudes; establishing new family routines; activating good support systems; and practising open family communication.ConclusionsThe transition process from the disruption of the family system to the cultivation of family resilience is perceived as a complex family dynamic in response to childhood leukaemia. Our findings can form the basis for further research about resilience‐based family interventions that promote family well‐being during the early stages of a childhood leukaemia diagnosis.Relevance to Clinical PracticeIt is necessary for healthcare professionals to provide essential support for families to face the challenges of diagnosis and treatment to facilitate the successful transition to family resilience. By understanding the dynamic process of developing family resilience, healthcare professionals are able to focus on these families to provide holistic care that satisfies the specific demands of family members.
