Over the past decade, the resilience concept has gained great importance in climate change, sustainability, and city disaster researches. To tackle the problem that follows the concept, this dissertation posits a formal theory of resilience. In this sense, resilience provides a semantic reference frame for city risks and disasters.  Key terms, which fall under the purview of resilience, are defined. The research problem was crystallized to be formulated as “Our cities of today face many challenges and sudden shocks that are difficult to be predicted,” and “Negligence of the disparities in spatial competence has caused difficult situations to face sudden challenges and shocks to reach the more resilient city.” The aims of this research: 1) to build a conceptual framework for the concept of resilient cities, as well as the determination of spatial competence that has a significant impact on varying levels of resilience in places; 2) to reach a resilient Iraqi city strategy by adopting five more vital areas in Baghdad city. The research hypothesis is as follows: Adopting the presence of spatial competence in the area will facilitate the process of making resilient cities to face risks and sudden shocks. To achieve the research objective, the theoretical framework, built to consist the main research conclusion, was that there is spatial competence and place efficiency in any spatial dimension, which makes it difficult to deal with each place in the same way; every place has its own privacy and accessibility to its best strategies in temporal and spatial dimensions.
