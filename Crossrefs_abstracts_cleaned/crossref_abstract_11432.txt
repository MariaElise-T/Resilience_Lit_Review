Abstract
Seismic events pose a significant threat, particularly to rural communities, with poorly developed construction practices. This has resulted in the loss of life and considerable economic losses owing to substantial numbers of house collapses. The application of best practice in disaster construction knowledge as a means of significantly improving housing resilience is, therefore, a key challenge for most rural construction practices. In this context, effective utilization of available, and feasible technologies in rural areas can help to solve the problem of the inadequate facilitation of communication that is needed to deliver knowledge on the construction of long-term disaster-resilient housing. The study examines the potential for improvement of housing resilience from a disaster knowledge perspective. It responds to the challenges of the effective application of best building practice guidelines in such contexts. The main question of our research is, “Are communication technology tools capable of having a positive effect in establishing a knowledge transfer framework in rural Pakistan?”. The study employs both literature and questionnaire survey, and explores the availability and usability of technologies. It takes a premise in which effective knowledge transfer via reasonably available technological tools can be actionable and made operational. Our findings support the creation of a knowledge transfer framework for rural housing construction to improve disaster mitigation. The approach can assist rural communities in reducing losses and improving response and recovery, thereby improving housing resilience and lowering vulnerabilities.
