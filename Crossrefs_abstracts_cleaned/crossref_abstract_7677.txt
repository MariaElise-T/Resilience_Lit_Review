 This study a utilized phenomenological hermeneutic design. Fourteen Iranian family caregivers of patients with COVID-19 who were isolated at home were included in the study using purposive sampling. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted via WhatsApp. Sampling continued until data saturation. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Van Manen’s approach. Three primary themes and eight subthemes emerged. The primary themes included: “captured in a whirlpool of time”, “resilient care’ and “feeling helpless”. It seems that the families of patients with COVID-19 attempt to resist the pressures of this disease with religious practices and problem solving. However, due to the nature of the disease and its severity, they sometimes feel ashamed or lonely and are afraid of losing their loved ones. It is recommended that psychiatric nurses should develop programs in the form of comprehensive spiritual care packages or psychological support and utilize multiple media channels to deliver these.
