Due to the global uncertainty caused by social problems such as COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, companies have opted for the use of emerging technologies, to produce more with fewer resources and thus maintain their productivity; that is why the market for wearable artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has grown exponentially. In the last decade, maintenance 4.0 has achieved best practices due to the appearance of emerging technologies that improve productivity. However, some social trends seek to explore the interaction of AI with human beings to solve these problems, such as Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0. The research question is: could a human-in-the-loop-based maintenance framework improve the resilience of physical assets? This work helps to answer this question through the following contributions: first, a search for research gaps in maintenance; second, a scoping literature review of the research question; third, the definition, characteristics, and the control cycle of Maintenance 5.0 framework; fourth, the maintenance worker 5.0 definition and characteristics; fifth, two proposals for the calculation of resilient maintenance; and finally, Maintenance 5.0 is validated through a simulation in which the use of the worker in the loop improves the resilience of an Industrial Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN).
