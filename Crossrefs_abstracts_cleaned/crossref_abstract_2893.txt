This essay assesses the principles of economic vulnerability and resilience and their contribution to the study and development of small island developing states (SIDS). It is based on a detailed critical account of the contents of a recent publication - Briguglio & Kisanga (2004) - that addresses this issue. It is thus an extended book review that examines arguments central to many current mainstream considerations of small island economies.
