Abstract
Resilience is an important feature of autonomous systems. To be resilient, a control system must be stable, robust, and safe. This paper explores the use of hybrid feedback controllers to ensure robustness towards uncertainties and disturbances in motion control systems for autonomous ships. Motivated by recent developments in control barrier functions (CBFs) for safe maneuvering of autonomous ships, a CBF-based hybrid kinematic controller for obstacle avoidance is proposed. The controller uses course angle as control input, making it suitable for ships with a limited speed envelope. The performance of the controller is illustrated by simulations, using an underactuated ship as a case study.
