The airborne transmission loss across resilient mounting systems is investigated by developing an analytic model of the transmission of vibration from a point-driven, simply supported plate to a parallel infinite plate through the air separating the plates. Predictions of airborne transmission losses are compared with transmission losses through resilient mounts to quantify the role of the airborne path in transmission losses through well-designed, single-stage resilient mounting systems. The sensitivity of the airborne transmission losses to separation distance, thickness of the receiving plate, size of the driven plate, and damping in the plates are presented.
