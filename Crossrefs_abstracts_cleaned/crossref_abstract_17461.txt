The use of spatial data for coastal community resilience applications has diversified as a consequence of the increasing availability of data, and extensive development in data processing. However, the true value of spatial data is not fully exploited as a result of lacking scientific managerial models that incorporate spatial data into decision-making. This article synthesizes the cross-disciplinary literature review on deploying spatial data for coastal community resilience from the managerial perspective. It systematically reviews research addressing the topic of deploying spatial data for coastal resilience operations from the earliest available to 1999. The review uses 142 studies to address three research questions: (1) What kind of data can be obtained for coastal resilience situational awareness? (2) What outcomes have spatial data attributed to coastal resilience applications? and (3) What are the missing pieces (gaps) in connecting the spatial data with coastal resilience applications? In addressing these research questions, the authors review articles based on three dimensions including the availability of spatial data, the availability of applications, and limitations. Based on the findings of the analysis, the authors conclude that the managerial perspective of deploying spatial data in coastal hazards are understudies, and outline problem formulation, mission prioritization, and information salience as an agenda for future research.
