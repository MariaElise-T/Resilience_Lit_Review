 Investigate the effect of Nine-in-one-drawing therapy on anxiety, depression, and psychological resilience of community correction objects. Sixty cases of community correction objects with anxiety and depression were randomly divided into experimental group and control group, with 30 cases in each group. The conventional psychological correction methods was adopted in the control group and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to evaluate. In the experimental group, Nine-in-one-drawing therapy was adopted based on the correction items of the control group, and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used before and after intervention in the two groups for evaluation. The intervention activities in the two groups were carried out five times separately, with a duration of about 1 hour and an interval of 3 days. After the intervention, the anxiety and depression scores of the community correction objects in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the psychological resilience scores were significantly higher than those in the control group (both p < .05). Nine-in-one-drawing therapy can reduce the anxiety and depression of community correction objects, and improve their psychological resilience.
