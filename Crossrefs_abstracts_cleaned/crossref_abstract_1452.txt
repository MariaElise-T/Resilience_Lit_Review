 Resilience is an important social justice concept that has important implications for educators working with exceptional youth in rural underserved communities who may suffer from the consequences associated with economic hardships. This multi-school qualitative study examined resilience among exceptional youth living in rural poverty through the lived experiences of school counselors and teachers who work with this population. Findings include the discovery of unique factors based on the resiliency constructs of risk, positive personal qualities, and positive social conditions. Implications for strengths-based treatment as well as recommendations for future research are highlighted.
