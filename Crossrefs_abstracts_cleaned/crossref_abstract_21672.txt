Significance
Many small-scale, self-organized systems have persisted for hundreds of years and been the subject of studies seeking to understand effective governance. The lack of formal analytically tractable models of such coupled infrastructure systems hinders linking knowledge gained from those studies to such concepts as resilience and robustness. Here, we develop a stylized, generic model of these systems. The analysis clarifies complex interactions and feedbacks that yield different system outcomes. The boundaries between these outcomes are expressed in clear functions of biophysical and socioeconomic factors and can potentially be used to develop resilience metrics. Such regime boundaries clarify how changes in biophysical and socioeconomic drivers affect the system outcome and what changes in governance may be required to maintain its sustainability.
