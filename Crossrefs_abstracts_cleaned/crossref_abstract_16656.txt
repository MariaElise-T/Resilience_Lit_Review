Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the influence of HeartMath® on female college athletes’ abilities to holistically care for self as assessed through resiliency and power. Design: The descriptive design used mixed methods and was approved by the university’s institutional review board. The purposive sample was female college student athletes who were currently enrolled in a university program of study and played in a National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctioned sport. Method: There were eight weekly sessions where the holistic intervention HeartMath® was taught and reinforced. Participants completed two tools to measure resilience and power Weeks 1, 4, and 8: the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale and the Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool. At Session 8, a focus group interview was conducted to explore perception of how HeartMath® influenced caring for self as a student athlete. Findings: Although no statistical significance, emergent themes support that with HeartMath®, participants experienced an increase in resilience and power influencing their holistic caring for self. Conclusions: Findings support the need for additional research on the influence of HeartMath® on student athlete resilience and power in any team on and off the playing field.
