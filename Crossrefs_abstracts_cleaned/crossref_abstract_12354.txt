Abstract
Using the family resilience model, we examined the association between empowerment, family member age, length of institutionalization, and resilience among family members of relatives with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) following deinstitutionalization. Participants included 56 family members whose relatives with IDD recently transitioned to community living. Results strongly indicate empowerment plays a key role in positive family adaptation. Thus, following a relative's move from an institution to the community, empowerment is a promising form of protection that holds potential to increase family resilience. The results of the current study support the family resilience model as a foundation for future research regarding how families navigate significant transitions throughout the lifespan. Implications for practice and policy are provided.
