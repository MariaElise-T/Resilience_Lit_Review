The role of the forum is to develop adaptation strategies in a sustainable development context. This is an original attempt to link cultural heritage to climate risk.Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws from two initiatives and uses good practice established from the disaster management and climate communities and proposes a Cultural Heritage Adaptation Forum that can be used to formulate adaptation interventions for cultural heritage. The approach builds on active participation in a global overview of cultural heritage and climate risk led by UNISDR together with personal experience of implementing such strategies in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.Findings– The paper finds that a model can be developed that incorporates good practice from the climate and disaster management communities.Practical implications– The paper presents a model that can be used by those stakeholders that have an interest in protecting cultural heritage form climate driven hazards.Social implications– Cultural heritage has a value for all and protecting it from climate driven hazards can impact human well-beingOriginality/value– The paper brings together concepts from different academic and practitioner communities.
