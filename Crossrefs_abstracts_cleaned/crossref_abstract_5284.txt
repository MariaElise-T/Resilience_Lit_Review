AbstractIn this introduction to the special issue, Adaptive Tools for Resilient Bones: Biostatistical Approaches to Past Physical Activity in Osteoarchaeology, we discuss the outcome of the workshop held in Leiden (the Netherlands; November 18â€“19, 2021). We review statistical approaches to entheseal changes and present a series of new contributions to this field. These research, commentary, and review articles present different statistical approaches to entheseal changes and reflect the current state of research in the field.
