Electromobility has been crucial in mitigating transport emissions and meeting reduction targets. From this context, this literature reviewâ€™s main objective is to analyze the resilience of the electromobility supply chain that integrates renewable energy sources. This literature review focuses on the resilience of the electromobility supply chain and how it can incorporate renewable energy sources. The central argument is that the success of the supply chain depends on its ability to resist, adapt, and recover from disruptions that affect operations. We comprehensively review current knowledge in three stages: identifying critical components of resilience, highlighting challenges and opportunities for risk mitigation, establishing strategic alliances, and synthesizing vital issues, trends, and emerging areas that require further research. The findings emphasize the importance of improving supply chain resilience for sustainable transportation and environmental preservation under five guidelines: emergency preparedness, monitoring and evaluation, sustainable practices, maintenance of essential services, and prevention of operational disruptions.
