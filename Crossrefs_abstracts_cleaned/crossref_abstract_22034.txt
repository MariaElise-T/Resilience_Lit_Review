ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the resilience of health systems. In this paper, we seek to explore elements to support a research agenda on resilience for the Unified Health System (SUS). First, based on a scoping review, we analyzed the conceptual and methodological development of resilience applied to health systems research both at international and national levels, identifying who the formulating groups are and what they propose as analytical frameworks. Then, we propose an analytical framework adapted for the Brazilian health system features. The framework underpinned the pointing out of critical issues to be investigated in research on SUS resilience, based on four dimensions: governance and leadership, financing, resources (workforce, infrastructure, medicines, and technologies), and service provision. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges for implementing a research agenda on resilience for the SUS.
