Abstract
The resilience of the communication constellation is an important measure of the communication mission assurance capability of the communication constellation. In order to effectively measure the strength and weakness of the communication constellation, the research on the elastic evaluation method of communication constellation is carried out. First, according to the definition of the space system elasticity of the US Air Force Space Command, the definition of the communication constellation elasticity is given. Subsequently, the covering ability and reconstruction energy index are proposed as the objective function of the restored constellation performance recovery, and the damaged constellation performance recovery model based on NSGA-II algorithm is constructed. Finally, a resilience evaluation method for communication constellation with a single communication constellation as the evaluation target is established, and the simulation calculation is carried out by taking the MUOS constellation as an example. It is concluded that the constellation is poor in terms of robustness, and because of the lack of satellite performance, the task guarantee capability is limited.
