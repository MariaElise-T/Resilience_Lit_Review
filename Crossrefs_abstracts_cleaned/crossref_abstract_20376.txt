 Previous studies have examined the distinct stigmas of people living with HIV or of men who have sex with men (MSM). To capture the composite stress of HIV-positive MSM and the mixed stigma they experience, we conceptualized a compound stigma combining HIV status and homosexual identity. At two waves with an interval of 6 months, the results of 112 Chinese newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM showed that dual stigma at baseline increased distress symptoms 6 months later. Resilience moderated these effects, as the dual stigma increased, distress symptoms intensified more rapidly for individuals with lower resilience than they did for those with higher resilience. Our findings highlight that dual stigma, as an intensified risk factor, predicted distress among the Chinese newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM, conditioned by the protective factor of resilience. The results have strong implications for developing resilience-based intervention programs in this population.
