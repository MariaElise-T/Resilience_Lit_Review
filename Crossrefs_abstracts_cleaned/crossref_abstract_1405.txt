AbstractMotivationThe concept of resilience is widely embraced by practitioners and analysts concerned with development and humanitarian aid. It is less clear how to apply the concept in practice.PurposeTwo questions are addressed: What makes resilience programmes distinctive or different? How should evaluations of resilience be conducted?Approach and MethodsA typology of applications of resilience to development programming and evaluations is proposed. From considering the requirements of the different uses, two practical tools have been devised: the resilience programming matrix (RPM) and the resilience evaluation matrix (REM).Results or FindingsThe RPM defines six features of programming for resilience, covering concepts and implementation. The REM defines ten features by which to evaluate resilience, covering evaluation design, data analysis, and reporting. Together they aim to foster greater coherence and consistency in applications of resilience.Conclusions and Policy ImplicationsThe two heuristic tools offered should foster more dialogue among programme staff, reviewers and evaluators about resilience programming and evaluation. The conceptual frameworks highlight the distinctive features of the concept of resilience.
