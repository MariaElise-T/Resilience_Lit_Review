AbstractBackgroundWhile the necessity for interventions to build resilient nurses in the COVID‐19 pandemic is recognized, there is disagreement about the effective methods for achieving this.AimWe present our research protocol that describes plans to design and test an interventional program for promoting nurses' resilience.DesignThis sequential exploratory interventional mixed‐methods study is conducted in three phases (qualitative, intervention design, and quantitative).MethodsIt was funded from May 2021 for 24 months. In phase 1, we explored strategies for promoting resilience in the COVID‐19 pandemic from nurses' perspectives (through semi‐structured interviews). In phase 2, we will design an interventional program for promoting nurses' resilience (using the qualitative phase and literature review results). We will assess the program's effectiveness on nurses' resilience in a randomized controlled trial in phase 3.DiscussionGiven the different experiences of nurses of resilience in COVID‐19, our innovative program can guide future research to enhance nurses' resilience based on specific situations.
