Abstract
National food systems are constantly exposed to external triggers that reduce their resilience and integrity. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the vulnerability of many food systems that do not have a sufficient margin of safety and resilience, which requires the introduction of additional government support measures and stimulation of food production and transportation to destinations. The expanded concept of food security allows a more multifaceted look at this concept and reveal its essence. Assessment of existing external triggers and their clear identification will allow in the future to minimize their impact on the state of sustainability of the national food system.
