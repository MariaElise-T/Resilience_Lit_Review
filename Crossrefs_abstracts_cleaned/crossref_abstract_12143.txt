The assessment of coastal erosion risk is a major challenge, since environmental and geomorphic features, together with sea state parameters, can seriously change the configuration of coastal areas. In addition, the anthropic actions of the coastal communities may also drastically modify the configuration of the coast in vulnerable areas. In this study, a linkage between regional mapping guidelines and national geological cartography procedures is presented as a meaningful tool in the geomorphic trends analysis for the integrated mapping of the main morphological patterns of San Vincenzo’s coastal area, in the region of Tuscany (Italy). Comparing and joining different procedures—which have different scales and topics—requires adapting the fields and the information provided in maps and databases. In this case study, a GIS morpho-sedimentological approach is developed. This GIS approach enables us to cover several issues simultaneously, such as the representation of coastal active processes, the adaptation of regional and national cartography to coastal erosion assessment, and lastly the calculation of the sedimentary stock analysis, since it represents the first attribute of coasts to be preserved in a resilience-oriented integrated assessment.
