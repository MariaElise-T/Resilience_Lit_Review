Understanding the response of urban forests to extreme climatic events, such as drought, will be essential to predicting impacts of climate change on the urban tree canopy and related ecosystem services. This study evaluated variation in tree growth and drought resistance (growth during drought) and resilience (growth in period following drought) across four land-use categories (built, transportation, park, and semi-natural forest) and four species (Acer saccharum, Gymnocladus dioicus, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Pinus strobus) at The Morton Arboretum in suburban Lisle, Illinois, U.S. Tree growth and resistance to drought both varied as an interaction between landuse and species (F15, 100 = 5.25, p < 0.001; F15, 100 = 2.42, p = 0.005). Resilience of tree growth to extreme drought was generally high and did not vary across species and land-uses. In this study, individual tree species responses to drought varied across land-uses, illustrating the difficulty of predicting the reaction of urban forests to projected increases in the frequency of extreme climatic events. Tree growth response to drought varied even across the relatively narrow range of growing conditions studied here. Investigation of a broader range of sites, encompassing the full urban forest continuum, would likely demonstrate even greater variation in tree response to extreme climatic events.
