Regarding the important role of hospital managers in reaching the healthcare goals and realizing instances of the economic resilience in hospitals, the present study was conducted. The aim was to explore the perception of educational and healthcare centers’ managers in Isfahan regarding the concept and instances of economic resilience in hospitals.
Method: The data needed for this qualitative descriptive exploratory study were collected using semi structured interviews With 11 managers of educational and medical centers in Isfahan. Thematic analysis was used for the analysis.
Result: The concept of economic resilience included supporting domestic products, productivity, optimal use of resources, economy in consumption, strategic purchase, difference between economic resilience and economic austerity, and moving away from a mono-product oil-based economy. The basic components in instances of economic resilience included: drugs and equipment, human resources, financial management, installation and hoteling, consumption management, management and leadership, and information technology.
Conclusion: Due to the lack of a comprehensive definition about the concept of economic resilience from the participants' perspective, the goals of the economic resilience would not be achieved unless the executive authorities in large or small scale administration level conform to the ideas mentioned by the Supreme Leader of Iran.
