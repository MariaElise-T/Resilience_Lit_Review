AbstractThe hybrid AC/DC distribution network has become a research hotspot because of the wide access to multiple sources and loads. Meanwhile, extreme disasters in the planning period cause huge losses to the hybrid AC/DC distribution networks. A coupled PV‐energy storage‐charging station (PV‐ES‐CS) is an efficient use form of local DC energy sources that can provide significant power restoration during recovery periods. However, over investment will happen if too many PV‐ES‐CSs are installed. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal numbers and locations of PV‐ES‐CS in hybrid AC/DC distribution networks balanced with economics and resilience. Firstly, the advantages of PV‐ES‐CS in normal operation and extreme disasters are analysed and the payment function is quantified accurately. Secondly, a bi‐level optimal allocation model of PV‐ES‐CS in hybrid AC/DC distribution networks is established. In this model, the payment function using Nash equilibrium to balance economics and resilience is addressed at the upper‐level, and the typical scenarios are simulated, and the optimal results are obtained using the genetic algorithm in lower level. Finally, a series of examples are analysed, which demonstrate the necessity of balancing economics and resilience, and advantages of DC lines in network restoration after disasters.
