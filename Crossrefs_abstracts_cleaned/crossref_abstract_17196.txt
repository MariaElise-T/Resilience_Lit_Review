AbstractCoral reefs are model systems for studies of ecological resilience, with communities generally exhibiting multiple stable states and more resilient regions trending towards a single, coral-dominated, regime. We expand the theory of ecological resilience beyond the concepts of distinct stable states to integrate emerging ideas from transient dynamics as long-term intermediate states with no pronounced trend towards equilibria. We show that low coral abundance, together with stochastic larval supply and disturbance, can trap otherwise resilient reefs in a persistent intermediate state whose long-term outcome is difficult to predict. Common metrics, such as the ecosystem slowing down before crossing tipping points and using historical coral cover trends, may become unreliable predictors of future behaviour. Helping reefs out of transient states requires agile management that allows for short-term, targeted interventions after which natural ecological feedbacks can take over.
