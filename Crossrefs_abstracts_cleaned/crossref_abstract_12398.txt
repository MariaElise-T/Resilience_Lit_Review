Resilience is considered a core capability for nurses in managing workplace challenges and adversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought care homes into the public consciousness; yet, little is known about the resilience of care home nurses and the attributes required to positively adapt in a job where pressure lies with individuals to affect whole systems. To address this gap, an online survey was undertaken to explore the levels of resilience and potential influencing factors in a sample of care home nurses in Northern Ireland between January and April 2022. The survey included the Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale, demographic questions and items relating to nursing practice and care home characteristics. Mean differences and key predictors of higher resilience were explored through statistical analysis. A moderate level of resilience was reported among the participants (n = 56). The key predictors of increased resilience were older age and higher levels of education. The pandemic has exposed systemic weakness but also the strengths and untapped potential of the care home sector. By linking the individual, family, community and organisation, care home nurses may have developed unique attributes, which could be explored and nurtured. With tailored support, which capitalises on assets, they can influence a much needed culture change, which ensures the contribution of this sector to society is recognised and valued.
