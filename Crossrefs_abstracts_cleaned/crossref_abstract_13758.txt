Introduction: This research analyzes the behavioral and biological concepts of depression, aggression, and resilience. It also analyzes the Quran recitation as a noise-inducer for aggression but also encouraging intervention for depression.
Method: Experimental research with a post-test-only control group design created an agitated depression model in mice as a basis for understanding the biological concepts of aggression. Healthy mice (Mus musculus balb/c) aged 10-12 weeks, weighing 20-25 grams, were random-allocated into 9 (nine) groups, namely the control group (K_ negative, depression, and aggression), depression group (DP_1, 2, 3), and aggression group (AP_1, 2, 3). The tail suspension approach triggered helplessness to form a depression model. Quran recitation was performed above 60 decibels as noise exposure triggers agitation and forms an aggression model. QRP performed under 60 decibels was assumed to create a resilience model. Depression, aggression, and resilience were measured using an eight-arm radial maze (TM) and immobile time when hung (TG). After the intervention, mice were sacrified and the brains harvested. Normal cells were counted in the average of ten microscopic fields using 40x objective lens magnification and HE staining.
Results: The QRP alleviated the psychomotor retardation in the depression group, while the aggression group experienced a goal-directed behavioral activation as the cognition increased with psychomotor calm. Neuron cells were significantly different among groups; the optimum QRP dose was an hour once a day.
Conclusions: The QRP intervention can improve depression and aggression, but also a source of noise-induced stress at a higher frequency. These results should be carefully generalized and need further research.
