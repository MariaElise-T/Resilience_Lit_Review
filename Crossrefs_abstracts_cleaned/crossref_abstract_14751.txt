AbstractNurses' psychological resilience has been studied using a variable‐centered rather than a person‐centered approach, impeding a comprehensive understanding of the holistic expression of these different forms of psychological resilience. This study aimed to examine the characteristics of psychological resilience in a sample of Chinese nurses during COVID‐19 using latent profile analysis (LPA) and the relationships between these unique profiles and nurses' work fatigue. A total of 471 Chinese nurses were recruited from three hospitals in Hebei Province between June and July 2020. The participant samples were investigated with the psychological resilience scale and the work fatigue inventory. LPA showed that a three‐profile model of psychological resilience best fit this study. The resulting profiles were low psychological resilience, medium psychological resilience, and high psychological resilience. Notably, there were significant differences in nurses' work fatigue among different profiles of psychological resilience. The study provided a new view of nurses' psychological resilience, which may be used to effectively reduce nurses' work fatigue and evaluate nursing work status comprehensively.
