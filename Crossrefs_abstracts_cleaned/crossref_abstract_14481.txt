The aim of this research was to assess the relationship between resilience and career satisfaction. Individuals feel more satisfied with their choice of career when they are higher on resilience, resulting in higher self-esteem and better health. Such individuals have better control over their work, even in disruptive times. The study was conducted with 272 middle level managers (60% male and 40% female) from 10 private banks in Delhi/NCR India. The research illustrated that resilience has a positive and significant association with career satisfaction, accounting for 41% of variance, and established the moderating roles of trust, political skills and organizational identification in the resilience-/career-satisfaction relationship. Employers could benefit if they engage employees in resilience training programmes that endow them with the ability and tactics to deal with challenges and uncertainty about the future.
