 According to the Canada infrastructure report 2016, 62.6% of roads in Canada are in a good condition, nevertheless, with current investment rates, significant road networks will suffer a decline in their condition and will be vulnerable to sudden failure. Accordingly, this paper tackles the pavement resilience from an asset management perspective and aims at developing a resilience-based asset management framework for pavement networks. This was carried out through the development of five components: (i) a central database of asset inventory, (ii) a pavement condition and level of service assessment models, (iii) a regression of the effect of freezeâ€“thaw on pavement network, (iv) a financial and temporal models, and (v) an optimization model to formulate the mathematical denotation for the proposed resilience assessment approach and integrate the above components. The model results were promising in terms of maintaining pavement resiliency by selecting a near optimal intervention plan that meets the municipality limitations.
