AbstractDietary polyphenols promote memory in models of sleep deprivation (SD), stress, and neurodegeneration. The biological properties of dietary polyphenols greatly depend upon the bioavailability of their phenolic metabolites derivatives, which are modulated by gut microbiota. We recently demonstrated that supplementation with grape-derived bioactive dietary polyphenol preparation (BDPP) improves SD-induced cognitive impairment. This study examined the role of the gut microbiota in the ability of BDPP to prevent memory impairment in response to SD. C57BL6/J mice, treated with antibiotics mix (ABX) or BDPP or both, were sleep-deprived at the end of a fear conditioning training session and fear memory was assessed the next day. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed in fecal samples and BDPP-driven phenolic acid metabolites extraction was measured in plasma. We report that the beneficial effect of BDPP on memory in SD is attenuated by ABX-induced dysbiosis. We identified specific communities of fecal microbiota that are associated with the bioavailability of BDPP-derived phenolic acids, which in turn, are associated with memory promotion. These results suggest the gut microbiota composition significantly affects the bioavailability of phenolic acids that drive the dietary polyphenolsâ€™ cognitive resilience property. Our findings provide a preclinical model with which to test the causal association of gut microbiota-polyphenols, with the ultimate goal of potential developing dietary polyphenols for the prevention/treatment of cognitive impairment.
