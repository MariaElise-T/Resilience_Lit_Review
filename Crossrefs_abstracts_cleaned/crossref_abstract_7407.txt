A time-domain wind-induced damage evaluation for the risk- and resilience-targeted design of building structures requires nonlinear dynamic analysis (NDA) solvers to handle long duration input loads. Moreover, post-construction damage identification based on real-time vibration monitoring depends on accurate damage simulation from the design stage and available artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology. In this paper, an integrated time-domain approach for the performance-based analysis and design for wind is presented. The nonlinear dynamic analysis (NDA) is performed with the Force Analogy Method (FAM) and the stateâ€“space formulation to solve the nonlinear equations of motion. Then, the Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) is used to perform probabilistic fragility analyses for a typical reinforced concrete (RC) frame structure. The analysis also provides estimates of expected losses, gives the building owners business support data to compare, e.g., the final annual building income (FABI), the cost of repair and the function recovery duration for various wind events in an integrated resilience-based building design framework. This provides the basis for mapping structural damage on large urban scales and for straightforward quantification of wind-induced damage from available response acceleration time-series acquired from real-time vibration monitoring.
