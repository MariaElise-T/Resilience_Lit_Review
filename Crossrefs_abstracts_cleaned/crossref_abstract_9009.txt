Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to measure the factor structure of scale and it was discovered to be one-dimensional. ARS – Urdu version had significantly good reliability coefficient (α = .843). The scale validity and reliability were found to be satisfactory. Therefore, its findings demonstrated that it is appropriate for measuring academic resilience of school students.
