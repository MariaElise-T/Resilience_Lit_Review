The research objective of this work is to develop and evaluate an enterprise architecture for rural accommodation in the Iberian Peninsula that responds to the demand of the remote labor market. Through an extensive literature review and the application of ArchiMate modeling, this study focuses on providing an enterprise architecture that promotes business resilience and environmental sustainability and boosts the local economy. The proposed enterprise architecture is remotely evaluated by experts, highlighting potential benefits, challenges, and areas for improvement. The results show that the proposed enterprise architecture has the potential to improve the long-term success of rural lodging businesses, enhance the customer experience, promote sustainability, and contribute to economic growth in rural areas through value exchange among stakeholders. The ArchiMate model provides a holistic perspective on stakeholder interactions and interoperability across all functional business areas: Customer Service, Product Management, Omnichannel Commerce, Human Resources, Business Strategy, Marketing, and Sustainability Management. The idea is to empower rural lodging businesses to create a better customer experience, achieve energy and environmental efficiency, contribute to local development, respond quickly to regulatory changes and compliance, and develop new revenue streams. The main goal is to improve offers, mitigate seasonal effects, and reverse the continuous cycle of decline in areas with low population density. Therefore, this ArchiMate modeling can be the initial basis for the digitization or expansion of the rural lodging industry in other geographies.
