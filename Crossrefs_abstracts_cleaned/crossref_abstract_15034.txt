This paper presents a resilience-oriented energy management approach (R-OEMA) designed to bolster the resilience of networked microgrids (NMGs) in the face of extreme events. The R-OEMA method strategically incorporates preventive scheduling techniques for hydrogen (H2) systems, renewable units, controllable distributed generators (DGs), and demand response programs (DRPs). It seeks to optimize the delicate balance between maximizing operating revenues and minimizing costs, catering to both normal and critical operational modes. The evaluation of the R-OEMA framework is conducted through numerical simulations on a test system comprising three microgrids (MGs). The simulations consider various disaster scenarios entailing the diverse durations of power outages. The results underscore the efficacy of the R-OEMA approach in augmenting NMG resilience and refining operational efficiency during extreme events. Specifically, the approach integrates hydrogen systems, demand response, and controllable DGs, orchestrating their collaborative operation with predictive insights. This ensures their preparedness for emergency operations in the event of disruptions, enabling the supply of critical loads to reach 82% in extreme disaster scenarios and 100% in milder scenarios. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework, seamlessly integrating predictive insights and pre-scheduling strategies. This novel approach contributes to advancing NMG resilience, as revealed by the outcomes of these simulations.
