Food webs often include substructures that occur in much higher numbers than would be expected in random networks. These are referred to in the literature as network motifs. Here we explore how feedbacks within the most common food web motifs influence their responses to external factors such as environmental change or harvesting of species. We have used qualitative modelling approaches to demonstrate that simple three‐ and four‐member motifs that include a closed feedback loop can exhibit a diverse range of qualitative responses, some of which are non‐intuitive. The same outcomes are demonstrated to be emergent behaviors of larger food webs represented in complex ecosystem models. The sensitivity of ecological responses to small differences in food web motifs underlines the broader importance of structural uncertainty in ecological models. It is also argued that the resilience of species and their keystone status may be strongly influenced by their ecological role within particular motifs. Examples are provided from fisheries off southeastern Australian, where the slow recovery rates of some species have not previously been explained.
