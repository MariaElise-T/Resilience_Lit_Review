Abstract The demand for scientific knowledge in human-environment interface is a pressing need and an increasingly urgent one given the risk posed by global environmental changes. The Vulnerability and the Resilience approaches stand out in such context. Even though each one comes from different epistemic traditions, currently they are in a fertile interdisciplinary field. This paper presents a critical discussion on the similarities, differences and limitations for the dialogue between both, given the effort to solve problems emerging from the interactions between society and environment, particularly on climate change research. Although a conceptual convergence is on course, there are still theoretical and methodological perspectives that halt the merger into a single approach. However, since both look at the same issues and are based on similar research questions, there is great potential for beneficial complementarity in advancing interdisciplinary research on socio-ecological systems.
