Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-level hierarchical framework (evaluation index system) toward evaluating an “appraisement index” from the prospectus of measuring and monitoring resilient performance of the candidate industry.


Design/methodology/approach
In this reporting, vagueness, imprecision, as well as inconsistency associated with subjective evaluation information (aligned with ill-defined assessment indices of SC resilience performance), has been tackled by the application of fuzzy theory.


Findings
Subjective evaluation information (expressed in linguistic term) acquired from the committee of decision makers (called expert group), against different resilience indices/metrics, has been fruitfully explored through the proposed fuzzy-based resilience performance appraisement module. Finally, a case study from an Indian automobile company has been conducted from the perspective of checking effectiveness of the proposed methodology for evaluation of appraisement index indicating SC resilience extent.


Originality/value
This methodology might be successfully applied to help other decision-making problems from the perspective of performance appraisal and benchmarking of candidate alternatives/choices under predefined criteria and subjective evaluation circumstances.
