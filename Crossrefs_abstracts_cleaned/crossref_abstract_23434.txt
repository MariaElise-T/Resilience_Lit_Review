Objectives  The purpose is the study builds a research model based on previous research to construct a model that can predict the relationship between clinical nurses' empathy capacity, self-compassion, resilience, and pa-tient-centered nursing, and the model fit and structural relationship between the research hypothesis and the re-search model analyzed.
Methods  The subjects of the study were three general hospitals with more than 250 beds in U City, and 230 clinical nurses were selected as a convenience sample. Data were collected from August 1 to August 10, 2023 by filling out a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis used SPSS 25.0 and AMOS 25.0 programs and was analyzed through structural equation model(SEM).
Results  The significance verification results of the path coefficient, in empathic capacity, self-compassion (β=.504, p<.001), resilience (β=.693, p<.001) and patient-centered nursing (β=.849, p) <.001) was significantly positive (+). The direct path from resilience to patient-centered nursing (β=.399, p<.001) was positive and significant, and the direct path from self-compassion to patient-centered nursing was not significant. The significance of the media-ting effect was verified through bootstrapping, and the indirect effect of empathy on patient-centered nursing by mediating self-compassion (β=.293, p<.001) and patient-centered nursing by mediating resilience The indirect effect (β=.508, p<.001) was verified to be statistically significant.
Conclusions  Clinical nurses' empathy competency had a direct effect on patient-centered nursing and also had an indirect effect through resilience and self-compassion, so it was verified that resilience and self-compassion played a partial mediating role in the impact of empathy competency on patient-centered nursing.
