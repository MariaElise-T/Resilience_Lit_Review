 This study assesses resilience and general self-efficacy among Kenyan orphans and vulnerable children ( n = 1060) active in a community-based program combining economic household strengthening with psychosocial support. Quantile regression analyses modeled associations between the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of resilience and general self-efficacy and multiple covariates. Program participation positively predicted increased general self-efficacy at all levels. Program participation predicted increased resilience at the 25th percentile but decreased resilience at the 75th percentile. Other significant predictors included economic, educational, sexual behavior and other demographic factors. This study suggests support for an integrated approach to economic and psychosocial empowerment.
