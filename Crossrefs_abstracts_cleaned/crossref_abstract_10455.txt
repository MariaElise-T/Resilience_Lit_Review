Cultural landscapes are living landscapes shaped by human activity and imbued with cultural and historical significance. However, cultural landscapes are threatened by climate change because of the direct and indirect impacts it has on all types of cultural heritage resources. This research aims to investigate the efficacy of transdisciplinary and participatory planning approaches in augmenting the resilience of cultural landscapes in the face of climate change risks. This article presents a novel contribution by examining the recovery process of the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System (SHHS) through the lens of international principles aimed at mitigating natural hazards and fostering resilience. The methodology adopts a comprehensive approach that combines a systematic literature review with a detailed analysis of the recovery process of the SHHS during the 2019 flooding in Khuzestan Province, Iran. The research findings highlight the significance of employing a transdisciplinary and participatory planning approach to enhance climate resilience within cultural landscapes. The active involvement of the local community throughout the process of resilience strategy development and implementation emerges as a pivotal factor. Furthermore, the success of resilience strategies in cultural landscapes relies on key elements such as accurate identification and communication, capacity building, fostering trust, and ensuring sufficient funding.
