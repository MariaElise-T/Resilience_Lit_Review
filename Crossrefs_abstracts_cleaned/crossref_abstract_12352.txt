AbstractThis paper aims to present a structured perspective regarding the strategic sourcing process with the aim of enhancing supply chain resilience during disturbing events. For this purpose, it uses a descriptive approach, based on theoretical insights in order to provide a detailed strategic sourcing process, which adopts a risk‐based orientation. Each of the five main steps of the strategic sourcing process that are identified have aspects related to the supply chain resilience that need to be taken into consideration on the sourcing decision‐making. The framework that is presented provides relevant insights regarding on how to effectively conduct the strategic sourcing process with the prescription that decision‐making needs to be transparent. It is hoped that the constructs presented in this paper encourage researchers to conducting empirical studies in order to obtain evidence related to the strategic sourcing process and its relations with supply chain resilience. The proposed framework of this paper, can also potentially support practitioners involved in the procurement and strategic sourcing activities by providing an effective guidance as to how to appropriately engage in decision‐making with respect to strategic sourcing. The approach proposed is unique, bringing a timely and novel approach by relating strategic sourcing with supply chain resilience during disturbing events.
