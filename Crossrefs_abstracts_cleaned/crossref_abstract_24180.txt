Significance
The interactome network of protein–protein interactions captures the structure of molecular machinery that underlies organismal complexity. The resilience to network failures is a critical property of the interactome as the breakdown of interactions may lead to cell death or disease. By studying interactomes from 1,840 species across the tree of life, we find that evolution leads to more resilient interactomes, providing evidence for a longstanding hypothesis that interactomes evolve favoring robustness against network failures. We find that a highly resilient interactome has a beneficial impact on the organism’s survival in complex, variable, and competitive habitats. Our findings reveal how interactomes change through evolution and how these changes affect their response to environmental unpredictability.
