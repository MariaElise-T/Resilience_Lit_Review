AbstractWith the increasing intensity of global human activities, the ecosystem function, which is supported by the microbial community, will be dramatically changed and impaired. To investigate microbial resistance and resilience of microbial communities to human activities, we chose two typical types of human disturbances, urbanization, and reclamation under the higher intensity of human activities than the global average level. We examined microbial traits, including the abundance, diversity, phylogeny, and co‐occurrence interactions in soil microbial communities, together with the nitrification activities observed in the subtropical coastal ecosystem of the Pearl River Estuary and in soil microcosm experiments. Microbial communities were less resistant to the environmental changes caused by urbanization than to those caused by reclamation, which was significantly reflected in the nitrogen and/or carbon‐related patterns. However, most of the microbial traits could be recovered almost to the original level without significant differences in the microcosm after 40 days of incubation. The co‐occurrence interactions between nitrifiers and other microbial communities were dramatically changed and could not be completely recovered, but this change did not affect their nitrification activities for balancing the ammonium in the soil to the original level during the recovery stage, suggesting that the interactions between microbial communities might have fewer effects on their activities than previously thought. This study quantitatively demonstrated that microbial communities as a whole can recover to a status similar to the original state in a short time after the removal of stress at a large ecosystem scale even under the higher intensity of human activities than global average level in coastal ecosystems, which implied a strong recovery capacity of soil microbial community even after intense human disturbance.
