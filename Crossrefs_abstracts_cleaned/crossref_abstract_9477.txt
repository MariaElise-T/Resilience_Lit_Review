AbstractDisease resilience, defined as an animal’s ability to maintain productive performance in the face of infection, provides opportunities to manage the polymicrobial challenge common in pig production. Disease resilience can deliver a number of benefits, including more sustainable production as well as improved animal health and the potential for reduced antimicrobial use. However, little progress has been made to date in the application of disease resilience in breeding programs due to a number of factors, including (1) confusion around definitions of disease resilience and its component traits disease resistance and tolerance, and (2) the difficulty in characterizing such a complex trait consisting of multiple biological functions and dynamic elements of rates of response and recovery from infection. Accordingly, this review refines the definitions of disease resistance, tolerance, and resilience based on previous studies to help improve the understanding and application of these breeding goals and traits under different scenarios. We also describe and summarize results from a “natural disease challenge model” designed to provide inputs for selection of disease resilience. The next steps for managing polymicrobial challenges faced by the pig industry will include the development of large-scale multi-omics data, new phenotyping technologies, and mathematical and statistical methods adapted to these data. Genome editing to produce pigs resistant to major diseases may complement selection for disease resilience along with continued efforts in the more traditional areas of biosecurity, vaccination and treatment. Altogether genomic approaches provide exciting opportunities for the pig industry to overcome the challenges provided by hard-to-manage diseases as well as new environmental challenges associated with climate change.
