 Surgery residents are at a higher-than-average risk of burnout syndrome, which is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of ineffectiveness. This risk of burnout can translate to increased stress and distress in trainees, poor performance, as well as worse patient outcomes. Therefore, developing and implementing burnout reduction strategies that are feasible, acceptable, and effective among surgical residents is paramount. Studies demonstrate that inherent mindfulness is associated with improved resiliency, reduced stress and burnout, as well as improved cognitive and motor skill performance. Fortunately, mindfulness is a skill that can be developed and maintained through targeted mindfulness-based interventions embedded within surgical education curriculum. Here, we present the data supporting the use of mindfulness as an integral part of burnout reduction efforts in surgical trainees as well as highlight evidence-based strategies for implementation in diverse surgical training environments.
