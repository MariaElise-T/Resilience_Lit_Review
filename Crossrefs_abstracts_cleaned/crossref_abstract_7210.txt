AbstractResidents of low‐socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods suffer from social, economic, and health problems and high exposure to crime and neglect. Based on the social cure approach, the study aimed to examine whether community resources are associated with resilience and well‐being, and whether they mediate the associations between personal resources and these outcomes. The moderating effect of participating in community activity was also investigated. A total of 400 residents of low‐SES communities, 200 of whom were community activists, completed questionnaires measuring personal resources, community resources, and the outcomes (resilience, well‐being). Structural equation modeling revealed the mediating role of community resources. Moderation analysis indicated that different paths led to the outcomes among activists and nonactivists. The results indicate that personal resources alone do not substantially enhance welfare in low‐SES communities, but should be channeled through community belonging and commitment. Moreover, professionals working with these communities should take into account the distinctions between activists and nonactivists.
