              The transition to college can be an exciting, albeit stressful, time in studentsâ€™ lives, as many begin living apart from family and friends for the first time and must adapt to new and increasingly demanding academic, social, and financial pressures while adjusting to life in an unfamiliar environment. As a result of this transition, first-year college students tend to experience greater stress, anxiety, and psychological distress (eg, depression) relative to upperclassmen.

              The extent to which students are able to cope with stressors during the first year of college has important implications not only for their social-emotional adjustment, but also for the likelihood of their academic success and persistence in postsecondary education.
