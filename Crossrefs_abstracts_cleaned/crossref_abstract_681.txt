The trend regarding providing more distributed solutions compared to a fully centralized operation has increased the research activities conducted on the improvement of active regional communities in the power system operation in the last decades. In this study, an energy management-oriented decision-making mechanism for residential end-users based local community is proposed in a mixed-integer linear programming context. The proposed concept normally includes inflexible resiliency-sensitive load–demand activated as flexible during abnormal operating conditions, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) fed via the hydrogen provided by an electrolyzer unit connected to the residential community and capable of acting in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode, common energy storage and photovoltaic (PV) based distributed generation units and dispersed PV based generating options at the end-user premises. The combination of the hydrogen–electricity chain with the V2G capability of FCEVs and the resiliency-sensitive loads together with common ESS and generation units provides the novelty the study brings to the existing literature. The concept was tested under different case studies also with different objective functions.
