This research employs Wildavsky’s two strategies—anticipation and resilience—as our conceptual framework to compare COVID-19 policies in the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan. Also, following Handmer and Dovers’ three types of resilience, we develop theory-driven codes and then explain how governmental structures and cultural factors influenced governmental responses. We found that a key response to this pandemic is arguably correlated with how quick and flexible a government can adopt different types of resilient strategies. Our research provides a foundation for governmental emergency response discussions and management strategies to better cope with public health crises in the future.
