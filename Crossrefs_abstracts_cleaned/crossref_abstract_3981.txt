The different considerations of this study analyze in biblical tradition and modern times experiences of displacement and their consequences for educational purposes and resilience. Exemplified by Baltic experiences, it demonstrates how memory constructs coping strategies, which can be transferred into models of enculturation and value-education. Following the stages of the Biblical story of Jewish exile and diaspora, the considerations analyze, how modern people in situations of crisis, transition, mobbing or displacement can draw benefit from the existential experiences memorized in these narratives and actualized in rituals as a memory-culture and process of enculturation. In this context, different memory cultures, focused on a common situation, underline different expressions of remembrance and suggest different approaches to cope with them: symbolic, ritualized, narrative. In this study the Exile- and Diaspora-oriented EXODUS, exemplified by the Baltic exile before and after 1945, facilitates a framework for educators to identify and integrate experiences of exile and diaspora into a concept of enculturation, which combines holistic exercises in non-violent communication, awareness, creative work, intercultural discourse and similar experiences. Furthermore, it assists them to facilitate opportunities to make helpful experiences in their own diaspora-like framework. Key words: Baltic, diaspora, enculturation, Exodus, resilience.
