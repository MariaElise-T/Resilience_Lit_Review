This paper introduces a questionnaire as a measurement tool that will help evaluate the armed forcesâ€™ resilience to hybrid interference. It is based on the previously developed conceptualisation of resilience as consisting of the national, social, institutional, and psychological dimensions and guides the reader through the operationalisation of the corresponding variables in the form of a questionnaire to be distributed within different groups of the Czech Armed Forces.
