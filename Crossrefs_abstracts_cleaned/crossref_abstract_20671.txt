Communities of practice are a common mechanism to support individuals who share a passion for a common area of interest, including implementation of comprehensive medication management services. In addition to supporting the exchange of ideas and experiences, a community of practice can be the convening point for resources that instill a sense of renewal and rejuvenation which can build resilience among practitioners participating in the community. This paper describes the Pharmaceutical Care Lyceum, a retreat‐style strategy designed to accomplish this outcome, which has become a critical component of the community of practice serving ambulatory care practitioners in Minnesota. Key elements that have led to the Lyceum's success include an “all teach, all learn” environment, an emphasis on group dialogue, a remote meeting location that encourages one to “disconnect” from daily activities, on‐site shared accommodations, and recreation and social activities interspersed between interactive learning sessions. Evaluations from participants are highly positive and frequently comment on the role of the Lyceum in creating enthusiasm and determination for the daily work of clinical practice. This paper explains the history, design, and impact of the event to encourage replication by other communities of practice focused on practitioners engaged in comprehensive medication management practice.
