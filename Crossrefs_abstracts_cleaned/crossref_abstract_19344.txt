Recent earthquakes have highlighted additional losses due to the lack of resilience of damaged structures. Environmental impact, as performance indicator, has also received increased attention within performance-based earthquake engineering. In this article, a combined probabilistic framework is proposed to assess seismic risk, sustainability, and resilience of a non-ductile reinforced concrete frame structure. The framework utilizes three-dimensional inelastic fiber-based numerical modeling approach to develop limit states associated with performance levels. The decision variables (i.e. repair cost, downtime, and equivalent carbon emissions) are quantified at both component level and system level and are compared considering seismic risk, sustainability, and resilience. In addition, the proposed approach considers uncertainties in the building performance and consequence functions of structural and non-structural components. Fast-track and slow-track schemes are utilized as a repair strategy and probabilistic resilience is quantified given the investigated time period. The proposed approach can aid the development of the next generation of performance-based engineering incorporating both resilience and sustainability.
