Abstract
Developing successful urban resilience plans is a very challenging task due to the complex cross scale, multi sectoral dynamics of urban areas. This paper presents a novel integrated, multi sectoral, cross scale urban resilience assessment framework (iQRe) that facilitates bridging the spatial and sectoral gaps in the existing climate change adaption frameworks. The iQRe framework merges the IPCC AR5 risk assessment approach with the generic multi-criteria analysis methodology “SB Method” developed by iiSBE, creating a series of agile and quantitative climate impact chains that allow assigning a normalized numerical value to each of the 3 components needed to assess the climate risk (Hazard, vulnerability, and exposure). The Paper provide a sample application of the iQRe on a residential building.
