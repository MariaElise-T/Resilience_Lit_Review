In a world increasingly vulnerable to environmental and health crises, sustainable healthcare systems are crucial. This study focuses on the resilience and sustainability of healthcare services in Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Eastern Province, assessing their readiness to endure and adapt amidst disaster scenarios. Conducted through a cross-sectional survey involving 522 hospital employees, the research provides an in-depth analysis of various sustainability-related aspects of healthcare preparedness. This includes examining both structural and non-structural safety elements, standard operating procedures, staff training in disaster response, data security, and sustainable management of resources during emergencies. The results reveal a noteworthy commitment to sustainable disaster preparedness: 53.7% of hospitals, predominantly governed by the Ministry of Health, have implemented comprehensive disaster recovery plans. Furthermore, the study found a strong representation of female participants (54.2%) in these hospitals. A significant 64.1% of respondents confirmed the existence of disaster recovery plans in their workplaces, and an even higher percentage, 70.6%, reported receiving specific training in disaster response. These findings underscore the proactive efforts of Eastern Province hospitals in fostering a sustainable and resilient healthcare framework, demonstrating an approach that prioritizes preparedness beyond immediate crisis response. This proactive stance is pivotal in ensuring the continuity of healthcare services amidst the ever-evolving nature of global disasters.
