This research aims to check the mediating role of resilience between the relationships of hope with life satisfaction. Hope and mindfulness are independent variables and life satisfaction is the dependent variable. This is cross-sectional research and data was collected from 350 employees of an engineering company randomly.  Simple linear and multiple regression analyses are performed for testing the hypotheses of the study. Results indicate that hope has a direct positive impact on life satisfaction and resilience respectively. Moreover, resilience is partially mediating the relationship of hope with life satisfaction. The current study considers only the employees of Mott MacDonald Group. Current research is a case study on Mott MacDonald Group, so cannot generalize the results on other types of industry and describes only a few predictors of life satisfaction. Future researches will also conduct on the same kind of engineering firm for generalization.  In future researches, some other variables as predictors and outcomes may also include for explaining the phenomenon of life satisfaction. It is also beneficial to conduct this kind of research on sectors like the textile sector, banking sector, and telecom sector. Life satisfaction is very supportive for the organizations to maintain balance in work and lives of employees which may result in dedicated employees. The proposed research model of life satisfaction is satisfactorily supported by empirical tests.
