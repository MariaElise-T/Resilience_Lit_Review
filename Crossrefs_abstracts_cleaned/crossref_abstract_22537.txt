Purpose: This study was conducted to investigate the influence of grit and resilience on the retention intention of new nurses.Methods: The participants were 148 new nurses who had worked at two tertiary hospitals for less than 12 months. The data were collected on self-reported questionnaires from October 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022. T-tests, one-way analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman’s correlation analysis, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data.Results: Retention intention was significantly different according to placement in the desired department and job satisfaction. Retention intention showed a significant positive correlation with grit (p<.001) and resilience (p<.001). Significant factors influencing the retention intention of new nurses were resilience (β=.30, p<.001), grit (β=.27, p=.001), and job dissatisfaction (β=-.16, p=.029). These variables accounted for 29% (F=21.41, p<.001) of new nurses’ retention intention.Conclusion: The results of this study showed that considering these factors influencing the retention intention of new nurses might be helpful for strategies addressing nurse staffing challenges.
