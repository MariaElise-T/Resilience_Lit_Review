Objective We aimed to determine the effects of depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience on COVID-19–related functional impairment.Methods We obtained data from 476 community-dwelling adults aged 20–69 years living in Jeju, South Korea, and evaluated the relationships between COVID-19–related functional impairment (work/school, social, and home life) and sociodemographic and healthrelated characteristics, COVID-19–related life changes (financial difficulties since the pandemic, employment change, interpersonal conflict), and clinical characteristics, including depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience.Results Functional impairment in the home life domain was associated with marital status and monthly income. Greater work/school, social, and home life functional impairment was significantly associated with all COVID-19–related life changes. Regression analysis indicated that resilience modulated the positive associations of COVID-19–related functional impairment with symptoms of depression and COVID-19 infection fear when relevant factors were controlled for.Conclusion Our results suggest the importance of clinical characteristics, including depression, COVID-19 infection fear, and resilience for understanding functional impairment related to COVID-19. These results have important implications for interventions aimed at reducing depression and COVID-19 infection fear, and enhancing resilience.
