AbstractThis study extends previous research on organizational resilience by focusing on its relational resilience dimension and integrating with its operational resilience dimension. Our main goal is to understand relational resilience construct and complement it with operational resilience construct to have a complete and balanced picture of organizational resilience. We analyze complementary contributions of relational and operational resilience on organizational resilience in survival and sustainability dimensions. A multiple-case study has been conducted on two manufacturing and two service organizations. This study has conceptualized relational resilience beyond its survival dimension and extended it in sustainability dimension. This understanding enables congruence with the recent conceptualization of organizational and operational resilience in survival and sustainability aspects.
