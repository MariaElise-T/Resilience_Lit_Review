AbstractThe Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment and Adaptation is a theoretical framework used in this article to understand how families adapt when their child has had a traumatic injury. This article describes the Resiliency Model in relation to the findings of studies on families where a child has sustained a brain injury. Identifying the factors impacting on the family and the adaptation process they experience provides valuable insight and information for the provision of family-centred services.
