AbstractInternet of Things (IoTs) connects billions of devices through the Internet having billion of data points. The security and privacy of those data points are very important and considered as a major concern. Due to the resource constraints nature of IoTs, the security solutions for IoTs must be secure and lightweight in terms of processing and storage. However, many existing security solutions specifically in the field of authentication are not suitable for IoTs due to the computation involved. Alternatively, the lightweight existing solutions are vulnerable to various attack(s). In this paper, a lightweight and compromise‚Äêresilient authentication (LCA) scheme for IoT is proposed. The proposed LCA scheme is lightweight because it uses lightweight hash and XOR operations. The security analysis manifests that the proposed scheme is compromise resilient against numerous security attacks. The proposed LCA scheme is compared with existing authentication schemes based on execution time, security, and computation cost. The outcomes show that the proposed LCA scheme is more secure and robust as compared to the existing authentication schemes proposed for IoTs.
