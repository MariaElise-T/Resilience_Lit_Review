BACKGROUND: Practice guidelines and research results emphasize the need for dyadic interventions targeting psychosocial outcomes such as depression, anxiety, social function, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Resilience interventions have been proposed as one strategy to influence these outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational pilot study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the Resilient Living program among persons with stroke or brain tumor (BT) admitted for comprehensive acute inpatient rehabilitation and/or their family caregivers. A secondary aim was to gather preliminary data to assess the effects of the program on quality of life, stress, anxiety, physical function, sleep disturbance, fatigue, resilience, dyadic coping, and caregiver role overload. METHODS: The Resilient Living program is a psychosocial intervention with a focus on building resilience skills. Feasibility and acceptability outcomes were assessed at the end of the study. Quantitative outcome measures were collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months post the intervention. RESULTS: Eight patients and eight caregivers completed the study. The intervention was feasible with this population. Participants found the intervention useful and appreciated the flexibility of an online program; however, finding time to engage in it was challenging. Recruitment of eligible patients with acquired brain disorders and their caregivers as a dyad was challenging. CONCLUSION: The study confirms prior research suggesting that interventions targeting resilience are feasible, but larger studies with more rigorous methods are needed to appreciate the influence of resilience interventions in persons with brain disorders and their caregivers. Further research is needed to identify the characteristics of those most likely to benefit from resilience interventions and the optimal timing of such interventions.
