PurposeSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) significantly contribute to economic growth, development, exports and employment of the nations. To maintain competitiveness in today's market, SMEs must explore and identify enablers to enhance their digital transformation process. This paper aims to shed light on some essential enablers SMEs can use to implement digital resilience successfully.Design/methodology/approachThe quantitative assessment and validation of the enablers have been done using powerful and novel techniques, namely, the Delphi method, “fuzzy interpretive structural modelling” (F-ISM) method and “cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC)” analysis. The F-ISM model is developed using the information drawn from digital transformation experts and practitioners involved in the digital transformation process for SMEs. Furthermore, the F-ISM model provides four paths to complete the pathway to digital resilience.FindingsThe F-ISM and MICMAC analysis revealed four ways to enhance the digital transformation process in SMEs. These enterprises can utilise these path assessments to become digitally resilient in the present dynamic scenario. To enhance digital resilience among SMEs, the study identified ten enablers. Among these, “management competencies” was the most crucial, followed by “knowledge management” and “monitoring and controlling”.Research limitations/implicationsThe present study is limited in that the data used to develop the models were collected from a small group of industry experts whose opinions may not exhibit the comprehensive views of the population.Practical implicationsThe findings can help SMEs enhance the digital transformation process by taking up different pathways to integrate the various enablers of digital resilience depending on resource availability.Originality/valueThe results indicate the most critical and influential enablers for enhancing digital resilience among SMEs. This research can be valuable to academicians, industry practitioners and researchers for guiding their future work.
