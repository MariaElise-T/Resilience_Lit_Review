 This paper proposes a dissipative resilient observer and controller (DROC) design for a network controlled system (NCS) that handles faults, implementation errors, or cyberattacks that can be modeled as bounded controller or observer gain perturbations. It presents linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for the robust stability of the system in the presence of bounded perturbations in the observer and controller. Furthermore, a new LMI-based time-delay control (TDC) algorithm that mitigates the effects of perturbations due to time-delays in the NCS is introduced. The robust methodology is applied to active control of a scaled model of a structural system equipped with an active mass driver system. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is robust and ensures stable system response due to various types of earthquake base excitations.
