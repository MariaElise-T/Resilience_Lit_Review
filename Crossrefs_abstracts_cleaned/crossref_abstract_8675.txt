Childhood trauma experiences can produce negative contributions to mental health such as anxiety, which can develop into trait anxiety. The increase in trait anxiety can be reduced by the presence of resilience in a person. This study aims to determine the effect of resilience as a predictor of trait anxiety in late adolescents with childhood trauma. This study involved 158 late adolescents with childhood trauma, consisting of 111 girls and 47 boys with the purposive sampling method. The measuring instrument used in this study is the Indonesian translation of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) for measuring childhood trauma, The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) for measuring resilience, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-2 (STAI Y-2) for measuring trait anxiety. Simple linear regression was used to analyze the data and obtained a significant result (p = 0,001 < 0,05, t = -5,081). The result of the study is resilience can predict the emergence of trait anxiety in late adolescents with childhood trauma, which indicates that the higher the level of resilience in a person, the lower the level of trait anxiety that exists, and vice versa.
