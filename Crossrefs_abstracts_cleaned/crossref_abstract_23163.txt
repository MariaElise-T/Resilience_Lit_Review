Introduction: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a period of uncertainty and stress for healthcare managers due to the lack of knowledge (about the transmission of the virus, etc.) and also due to the lack of uniform organisational and treatment procedures. It was a period where the ability to prepare for a crisis, to adapt to the existing conditions, and to draw conclusions from the situation were of critical importance to keep ICUs (intensive care units) operating. The aim of this project is to compare the pandemic response to COVID-19 in Poland during the first and second waves of the pandemic. This comparison will be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the response, including challenges presented to health professionals and health systems and ICUs with COVID-19 patients according to the European Union Resilience Model (2014) and the WHO Resilience Model (2020). The WHO Resilience model was suitable to the COVID-19 situation because it was developed based on this experience. Methods: A matrix of 6 elements and 13 standards assigned to them was created using the EC and WHO resilience guidelines. Results: Good governance in resilient systems ensures access to all resources without constraints, free and transparent flow of information, and a sufficient number of well-motivated human resources. Conclusions: Appropriate preparation, adaptation to the existing situation, and effective management of crisis situations are important elements of ensuring the resilience of ICUs.
