Background: Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental state of the faculty members of medical universities responsible for educating students in various fields of medicine needs to gain attention. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the psychological state of the Birjand University of Medical Sciences faculty members following the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this study, 122 faculty members of Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Iran, completed an online questionnaire containing demographic information along with two standard scales of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress-21 (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-25 (CDRISC-25). The data were analyzed using an independent t-test and ANOVA. Results: The prevalence of moderate to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress in the target group was 32%, 50%, and 41.8%, respectively. The lecturer rank members showed significantly lower resilience (P = 0.03). However, individuals with administrative positions had substantially higher resilience and lower depression and stress levels (P < 0.001). The resilience level was significantly higher in the participants with 10 - 20 years of work (P = 0.02). Master graduate members showed more depression and anxiety (P < 0.001). There was a significant negative relationship between resilience and stress, depression, and anxiety (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in the target group was considerable. Strengthening resilience according to its protective role could be an effective solution.
