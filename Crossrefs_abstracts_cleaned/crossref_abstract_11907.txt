Severe cold regions like Alaska are grappling with the challenge of adapting to unpredictable temperature fluctuations and ensuring indoor thermal comfort for occupants as well as saving energy consumption of the building. Therefore, proactive measures are crucial to adapt buildings to withstand the damaging consequences of extreme weather conditions. This study focuses on the evaluation of dynamic thermal performance in wall assemblies using composite infill panels integrated into a framing system, featuring vacuum insulated panels (VIPs). A precast residential unit located in Alaska serves as the testing ground. A comprehensive dataset collected by the Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) from January to April 2023 in Fairbanks, AK Leveraging, including outdoor and indoor temperature, heat flux, and relative humidity measurements is utilized. The evaluation of the wall panels' dynamic thermal performance is conducted by using two key metrics of Decrement Factor (DF) and Time Lag (TL). Additionally, the study examines the correlation between temperature fluctuations, heat flux, and relative humidity. The results reveal a direct correlation between temperature fluctuations during winter conditions and heat flux, while relative humidity demonstrates an inverse correlation. This research contributes to the development of energy-efficient and resilient buildings in Arctic regions. These insights will aid decision-makers in effectively adapting to the challenges posed by extreme weather conditions associated with climate change. Ultimately, this study paves the way for the creation of buildings that can thrive in severe cold climates while ensuring optimal energy efficiency and occupant well-being.
