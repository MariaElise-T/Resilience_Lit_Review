The article examines the influence of sports on the development of the resilience of adolescents as one of the adaptive resources of the individual to stressful situations. The scientific work provides a methodological justification for the impact of different types of activity on the formation of key components of resilience: engagement, self-control, risk taking. The organization of the study was to compare the indicators and the level of resilience of adolescents included in different social groups: the first group – the student athletes that are engaged in sports schools, the second group – the students of specialized schools for intellectually gifted students, the third one- the students of secondary schools. The study proved that the resilience of adolescents engaged in sports is significantly higher than that of adolescents of secondary schools who are not engaged in sports. But at the same time, the resilience of intellectually gifted adolescents has no significant differences compared to adolescent athletes. The results revealed the most significant relationship between such indicators of adolescent resilience as engagement and risk-taking. Further research may be related to the study of personal characteristics that are most associated with the resilience of adolescents, ensuring their ability to overcome stress factors from the external and internal environment.
