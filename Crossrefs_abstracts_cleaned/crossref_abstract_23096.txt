AbstractBackgroundInfertility is a major reproductive health problem in Pakistan. It has the potential to cause serious negative impact on a couple's marital life and psychological health.AimThis study aimed to assess the factors associated with maladjustment among infertile couples.MethodAn analytical cross‐sectional design was employed. Validated scales were used to assess marital adjustment, depression, resilience and quality of life among infertile couples. Purposive sampling was employed to enrol 334 infertile couples from a private infertility medical centre, of Karachi, Pakistan.ResultsAmong couples, marital adjustment scores were comparable, but resilience and quality of life were significantly low among wives whereas depression was significantly high among wives compared with husbands. Wives' marital adjustment was positively correlated with husband's resilience and quality of life and negatively related with his depression. After employing adjusted actor–partner interdependence modelling, wives' own depression and resilience had significant effect on their marital adjustment and their partner's resilience, depression and quality of life did not have any impact on their outcome. On the contrary, wives' resilience had a significant effect in increasing the marital adjustment of their husband.ConclusionThis study highlights the need to promote psychological support (resilience building skills) or couples' therapy to all those couples undergoing infertility treatment.
