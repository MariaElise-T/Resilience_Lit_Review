Sex as a biological variable appears to contribute to the multifactorial etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. We tested sex-based interactions between cerebrovascular function and APOE4 genotype on resistance and resilience to brain pathology and cognitive executive dysfunction in cognitively-normal older adults. Female APOE4 carriers had higher amyloid-β deposition yet achieved similar cognitive performance to males and female noncarriers. Further, female APOE4 carriers with robust cerebrovascular responses to exercise possessed lower amyloid-β. These results suggest a unique cognitive resilience and identify cerebrovascular function as a key mechanism for resistance to age-related brain pathology in females with high genetic vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease.
