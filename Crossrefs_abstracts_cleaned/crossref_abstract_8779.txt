The large flow data and information increasingly large and complex, and brings hidden costs in the form of cyber security threats. Cyber security concepts that are considered not responsive and resilient in dealing with and overcoming cyber attacks can occur at any time with patterns and types that continue to evolve. The concept of cyber security should begin to be developed into cyber security that has patterns of recovery, adaptation, and evolution so as to be able to answer the dynamics of challenges in international trade. Interrupted cyber systems in international sphere will potentially cause disruption of international relations because the threat of losses caused not only affects one country.
