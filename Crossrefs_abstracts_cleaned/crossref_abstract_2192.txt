Employers are being encouraged to find ways to engage with the mental health of their employees. Providing training in resilience is one way to respond. However, there is a lack of consistency and poor use of psychological theory which prevents comparison and evaluation between resilience training programmes. We describe a skills‐based model of personal resilience which is drawn from psychological research in resilience, positive psychology, and general psychology which responds to these criticisms. Firstly, we describe the psychological theory that provides the background to the skills‐based resilience model and research that contributes to the content of the model. Secondly, we focus on the application of the model to training, exploring the psychological processes that are needed to maximize the potential for individuals to develop and maintain resilience skills over the longer term.Practitioner points

Successful resilience training in the workplace requires the use of a comprehensive theoretically based model of both the skills needed for improved resilience and also the way the training is delivered.
Trainers who themselves use resilience skills, such as emotion regulation and pro‐social behaviours, to create trust and safety for participants are more likely to engage and motivate participants to make lasting changes.
Linking participants’ motivation to change, values and goals to resilience outcomes enhances engagement and the lasting impact of resilience training.
Offering opportunity to reflect on successes and challenges during the development of new resilience skills strengthens the skills and builds confidence to continue to use them in the future.
