The Neuroscience considers that the most resilient people maintain
                        greater emotional balance in stress situations, which allows them to better
                        withstand the pressure and, consequently, to experience a greater sense of
                        control and ability to cope with difficult situations. The aim of the
                        cross-sectional study is to analyze the preventive effect of resilience on
                        burnout perceived by Secondary Education teachers. The sample is constituted
                        by 334 teachers of the Province of Huesca. The data collection instruments
                        used are: a) to measure burnout, the adaptation to Spanish (MBI-GS) of
                        Salanova, Schaufeli, Llorens, Peir√≥, and Grau (2000) and b) resilience is
                        assessed using the CD Resilience Scale. -RISC (Connor and Davidson, 2003).
                        The correlational and factorial analysis of the information collected yields
                        results that confirm that the personal characteristics and the resilience of
                        the person act as preventive variables against the self-perception of
                        symptoms of chronic stress, typical of the burnout syndrome.
