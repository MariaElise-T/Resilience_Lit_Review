Abstract
In order to effectively improve the recovery efficiency of the highway network after the disaster and make the road network quickly recover to the normal operation level, the recovery strategy of the highway network after the disaster aiming at the optimal toughness was studied and formulated. First clear the toughness in this paper the definition and put forward the two toughness indexes, then constructs the model of road network resilience restored after a disaster, in considering the time, money, resources and cost conditions, through the corresponding genetic algorithm to solve, it is concluded that the shortest road repair, restore minimum loss in the process of recovery program. Finally, an example is given to illustrate how to use the model established in this paper. The results show that from the beginning of repair to the end of repair, the repair team can achieve the expected task in a faster time, which minimizes the performance loss of the road network and saves the cost.
