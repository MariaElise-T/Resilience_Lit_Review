Research on digital transformation, conducted so far, has revealed its explanatory power on the performance of companies. However, its effectiveness for relational capital and the resilience of digital entrepreneurship remains little explored. Even studies on the model, involving digital transformation and digital entrepreneurial performance, are few. To shed light on this grey area, interviews, and surveys of players in the digital economy were conducted. The mixed methodology was applied. Data generation was conducted through 15 semi-structured interviews and 160 surveys per survey. The digital transformation project decomposition approach was used. The results showed that the appropriation of new digital technologies, the creation of web media and the use of digital platforms improve the dynamics of relational capital, which increases the resilience of digital entrepreneurship. But, above all, it is the relational capital, made up of business networks, customer relations, database management mechanisms that promote the growth of new companies. The results of this article are useful for researchers who will find a renewed definition of digital transformation with proven new elements that prove relevant. While entrepreneurs and consultants will find new ways to effectively improve and enhance relationship capital and digital entrepreneurship. The study is part of the theory of dynamic capabilities and suggests that there is a differentiated relational contingency at each of the phases of the construction of digital transformation projects. It proposes a relevant action plan for researchers and entrepreneurs.
