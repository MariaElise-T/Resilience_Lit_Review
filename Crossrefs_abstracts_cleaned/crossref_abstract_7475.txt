The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between sleep-wake type, resilience, and depression in minority college students. Through the method of cluster sampling, 791 first-year students of a college in Hunan Province participated in a survey using the Questionnaire Star software, and chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software. The results showed that the depression-detection rate among girls was significantly higher than that among boys; the depression-detection rate among students who did not like the current major was higher than that among those who did; while the depression-detection rate among students with the intermediate-sleep type was higher than that among those with the night-sleep (late to bed and late to rise) and early-morning sleep (early to bed and early to rise) types. The depression-detection rate among students with low resilience was higher than that among those with medium and high resilience. In addition, the night- and intermediate-sleep types were more likely to predict students’ depression than the morning-sleep type, and low and medium resilience were more likely to predict students’ depression than high resilience.
