The problem of resilient guaranteed cost control for a class of singular interval systems with time varying time-delay was investigated. A condition for the existence of resilient guaranteed cost controller is derived via linear matrix inequalities (LMI) technology. Furthermore, it is shown that this condition is equivalent to the feasibility problem of a set of LMIs, and its solutions provide a parameterized representation of resilient guaranteed cost controllers. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of it.
