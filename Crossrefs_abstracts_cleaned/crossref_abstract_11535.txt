IntroductionThe concept “recovery” takes the position that individuals with severe chronic psychiatric disorders can recover and establish a certain degree of mental stability that can enable an independent and fulfilling life. To sustain recovery different variables and interdependent factors are needed, f.e. psychological resilience and empowerment. Actually, there are few studies focusing on the interdependency of recovery and resilience in patients with severe chronic psychiatric disorders, especially with an emphasis on overall psychiatric diagnosis and a longitudinal section.ObjectiveThe study examines residential patients with severe chronic psychiatric disorders who lived in a long-term care institution for psychiatric rehabilitation (SGB XII) in Lower Saxony and who were able to move out and live by themselves in 2016. Persons with mental retardation and patients who have spent more than 30 years in a long-term care institution will be excluded.MethodsRandomised controlled trial based on a mixed-methods-design and a longitudinal course (5 follow-ups within 24 months after the first interview).AimsInvestigate factors for independent living on different levels (like micro, meso, macro) with focus on recovery and resilience by patients with severe chronic psychiatric disorders.ResultsFirst results of a pilot study and focus groups will be presented.ConclusionResults of investigation should be used in different subject areas like identification of factors enabling independent living and creation of effective therapy interventions for patients with severe chronic psychiatric disorders who have lived in a long-term care institution.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
