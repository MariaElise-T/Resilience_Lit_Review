Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the country’s health systems and diminished its capability to provide safe and effective healthcare. This article attempts to review patient safety issues during COVID-19 pandemic in India, and derive lessons from national and international experiences to inform policy actions for building a ‘resilient health system’. Methods: Systematic review of existing published articles, government and media reports was undertaken. Online databases were searched using key terms related to patient safety during COVID-19 and health systems resilience. Seventy-three papers were included dependent on their relevance to research objectives. Findings: Patient safety was impacted during COVID-19, owing to sub-optimal infection prevention and control measures coupled with reduced access to essential health services. This was largely due to inadequate infrastructure, human and material resources resulting from chronic underinvestment in public health systems, paucity of reliable data for evidence-based actions and limited leadership and regulatory capacity. Conclusions: India’s health systems were found ill prepared to tackle large-scale pandemic, which has major implications for patient safety. The shortcomings observed in the COVID-19 response must be rectified and comprehensive health sector reforms should be initiated for building agile and resilient health systems that can withstand future pandemics.
