The increasing developmental potentiality for the construction industry brings the huge challenge to make up the limitation of traditional construction project management mode when adapting to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the high energy and resource consumption for the construction projects, there are a large number of uncertainties and disturbances in achieving resilient urban infrastructure. Studying construction project resilience (CPR) is imperative. However, prior studies preferred to measure resilience by systemic indicators, which are complex and unfriendly. Studying CPR from the perspective of employee behavior (EB) remains rare. Hence, this study proposed a social network analysis (SNA) methodology to overcome the research gap. Firstly, six EBs are identified by the systematic literature review (SLR). Then, the critical employees (CEs) and their interrelationships are investigated to form the social network. Six SNA parameters including density, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, efficiency, constraint, and cliques are selected to model the EBs, namely PMT cohesion, the identity of the project culture, formal behavior between employees, collaboration efficacy, informal social constraints, and reciprocity and mutual trust. Finally, the value of CPR is obtained and the strategies for improving the CPR are proposed from four characteristics: robustness, redundancy, rapidity, and resourcefulness. The findings provided a simple and effective techniques to measure the CPR and could benefit the project manager to improve the CPR by exerting accurate strategies to the EBs in poor performance.
