PurposeThis paper aims to review the state-of-the-art of literature of supply chain resilience (SCR) and to map the SCR domain, so as to provide a launchpad for further knowledge development and dissemination.Design/methodology/approachCiteSpace as a bibliometric analysis software was used to systematically, comprehensively and accurately review the SCR-related literature and to then develop an SCR research map.FindingsThe results revealed the existing SCR publication base, domains, highly contributed publications, research hotspots, key milestones of SCR research development and a dynamic platform to integrate future research and development of SCR.Originality/valueThe scientific contribution to SCR knowledge is an accurate and quantitative SCR research map, including the related SCR publication base, domains, pillars, hotspots, evolution and future trends. The methodology and the findings can be generalised to many other fields. Besides, the proposed SCR research map could be frequently updated by injecting future findings from similar studies to fill any residual or newly emerging research gaps. Moreover, the results could inspire further new knowledge creation in the SCR domain, identify future research demands in this field and ultimately boost the performance of global SCs by triggering smart and sustainable practices.
