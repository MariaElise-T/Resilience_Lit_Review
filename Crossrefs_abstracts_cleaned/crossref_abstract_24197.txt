This study compares the best and worst-performing hotels from Discovery Hospitality Corporation (DHC), a Philippine hotel group, based on their crisis responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs a polar-type multiple case study research design using qualitative data gathered through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with semi-closed questions. The data was analyzed to assess the viability of key indicators that compose organizational resilience. Proactive consideration of external conditions is imperative for a hotel to be resilient and to survive in a pandemic. The external conditions that were found to be important in this study are: (1) location of the hotel, (2) population in the geographical location, (3) access points, and (4) government regulations. The authors propose that organizational resilience in the pandemic context relies on the following insights: (1) the interdependence of adaptive capacity, planning, and proactive consideration of external conditions; (2) clarity and discipline in serving a concrete target market; and (3) partnerships across private and public sectors. The research findings and key outcomes are interpreted as theoretical insights in the context of the operating environment of the case. This study also suggests that moral actions do not necessarily go against the need to manage internal resources efficiently â€“ both can lead to resilience.
