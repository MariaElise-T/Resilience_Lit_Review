AbstractFor operational use there is a need to identify a set of measures that quantify the resilience. The ‘CoastRes’ project, a component of the UK Climate Resilience Programme, examined how an operational interpretation of resilience might be applied to the coast, building on existing approaches to shoreline management in the UK. The development of the methodology and resulting Coastal Resilience Model has been reported elsewhere. For this communication, we provide a brief summary of the management framework, the Coastal Resilience Model (CRM) and the preparation of the datasets, so that the limitations of the data available at a national scale are clear. We then illustrate how the Coastal Resilience Model has been implemented as the web-based CRM Portal. The purpose of the portal is to allow users to explore (i) the implications of future change on local and national resilience; and (ii) their own view of the relative importance of the Performance Measures that make up the Coastal Resilience Index. By exploring the influence of these weightings it is hoped that Stakeholders can develop a shared understanding of what is important for coastal communities.
