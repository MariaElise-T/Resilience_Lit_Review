 This mixed-method study examined school nursesâ€™ experiences during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic related to role change, psychological feelings, and coping/resiliency in the State of Hawaii. A total of 30 school nurses completed a Brief Resilience Coping Scale plus a series of open-ended questions in January 2022. On the coping scale, over 40% of participants scored high, 52% scored medium, and 7% scored a low resilient/coping level. We did not identify any association between coping level and participant characteristics. Three qualitative themes emerged: 1) school nurses experience chronic negative emotions related to the pandemic, 2) school nurses demonstrate attributes of resilience, and 3) school nurses utilize positive coping techniques. The pandemic created significant stresses and negative emotions among school nurses. Yet, school nurses reported effective coping strategies and demonstrated strength/resilience. Support and open communication between school nurses, their employers, and other school-based stakeholders is needed to provide continued support for school nurses.
