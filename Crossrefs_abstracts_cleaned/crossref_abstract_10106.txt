AbstractThis community‐based participatory action research (CBPAR) study describes a method for evaluating an after‐school resilience‐focused intervention in a low‐resource rural area of southern India. Communities Rising, a locally developed resilience and academic program, was evaluated in a cross‐continent collaboration between a research team at a U.S. university and the local community. The CBPAR literature highlights the importance of cultural considerations, community considerations, and community participation in the research process. The present case study describes the CBPAR research process and considerations at every phase of the research project, providing a road map of how community engagement can strengthen research, empower the community, and provide valuable knowledge. This study was conducted in three phases that focused on inclusion of local voices in the development both of the resilience program and the evaluation data collection process. Youth surveyors were particularly key to the research process. Data on participant demographics, satisfaction with the program, and qualitative contributions are also provided. Strengths and limitations of this study process in a rural community are discussed.
