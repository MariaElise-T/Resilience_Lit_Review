Abstract
With unprecedented urbanization in the 21st century, world nations have been consistently working on addressing climatic challenges and improving urban life. The Covid-19 outbreak has exposed the consequences of our negligent approach to urbanization and planning. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected each of us globally and has left us questioning the way we lead our lives. Severe repercussions of Covid-19 are felt across every aspect of the society. However, though pandemics have devastated mankind, a look into history proves that, they have been critical in modifying the condition of the built environment. This paper primarily focuses on the impact Covid-19 has on urban spatial planning, with an understanding of the relationship between pandemics and various spatial planning aspects. There is a critical assessment of the long-term impacts Covid-19 has on urban life across the world. The various challenges caused by the pandemic, with focus on urban planning context and the changes that has happened in the planning field, during the pandemic have been discussed. Covid-19 crisis could fundamentally change spatial planning and the current way of life. This necessitates the need to understand the challenges posed, the failures, the potentials hidden; and thereby facilitate building pandemic resilient cities for a better tomorrow. The current innovations and trends in urban planning as coerced by Covid-19 is researched and developed upon keeping in my mind the past lessons and issues to usher a new sustainable-resilient urban planning.
