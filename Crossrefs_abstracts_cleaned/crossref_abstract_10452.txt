This study is a descriptive research study investigating the relationship of teachers’ resilience levels with job satisfaction, burnout, organizational commitment and perception of organizational climate. Within the scope of the study, teachers’ resilience level was also investigated with regard to its relationship with gender, age, experience and the school level they teach. The study group consisted of 581 teachers. The data were collected through “Personal Information Form”, “The Resilience Scale for Adults”, “Job Satisfaction Scale”, “The Burnout Measure Short Version”, “Organizational Commitment Scale for Teachers” and “The Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire.” The results revealed a significant negative relationship between teachers’ resilience levels and burnout; and significant positive relationships between teachers’ resilience levels and organizational commitment, job satisfaction and perception of organizational climate. As a result of the one way ANOVA analysis regarding the differences between resilience levels of the teachers working at different school levels, it was found out that the resilience level of the teachers working at high schools differ significantly from the ones working at secondary schools in the family cohesion subscale, one of the sub dimensions of resilience. Additionally, resilience levels of the teachers who work at secondary schools were found to be significantly lower compared to the teachers who work at elementary schools and high schools. When the level of resilience was examined in relation to gender, it was concluded that there was no significant difference between the mean scores of the male and female teachers. The only significant difference was found in the perception of self subscale, where the mean scores of the male teachers were higher than the female teachers. There was no significant difference in teachers’ resilience or sub-scales of it in terms of age and experience of the participants.
