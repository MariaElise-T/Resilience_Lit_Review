 Previous studies of Latina/o well-being indicate that supportive family members, religion or spirituality, and cultural values (e.g., familismo) aid in coping with adversities. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of several factors (spirituality, hope, social support, and cultural values) in predicting resilience and thriving in Latina/o undergraduates ( N = 121). Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the unique contributions of the predictors to resilience and thriving. Results demonstrated differences between resilience and thriving as evidenced by the fact that they have different predictor variables. For example, hope was a predictor variable for both constructs, but spirituality was a significant predictor only for thriving. Implications for research and practice and future directions are discussed.
