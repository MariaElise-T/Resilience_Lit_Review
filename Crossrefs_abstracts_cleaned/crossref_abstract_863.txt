AbstractStand density affects not only structure and growth, but also the health of forests and, subsequently, the functions of forest ecosystems. Here, we integrated dendrochronology and repeated inventories for ponderosa pine research plots to determine whether long-term growth and mortality responded to climate trends and how varying stand density influenced the responses. The plots were established prior to 1975 on existing stands throughout northern California. Although annual temperature increased consistently for the last 65 years, ring-width indices produced by eliminating age and thinning effects failed to detect radial trend regardless of site quality. However, interannual variation for the indices was substantial, reflecting a strong influence of climate on tree growth. Plot-level basal area increments were significantly affected by tree mortality. Stand density index explained most variation of mortality. Lowering stand density enhanced remaining tree growth, reduced mortality, and increased stand resiliency to disturbances and climate change. Besides higher climate moisture indices or lower vapor pressure deficits, any treatments that improve tree vigor and reduce stress will have a similar effect to reducing stand density. Although neither biotic disturbances nor abiotic conditions can be controlled, forest managers can manage stand density appropriately to enhance resilience to climate change and disturbances.
