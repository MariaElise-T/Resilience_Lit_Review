Building resilience in cities requires, among other things, translating relevant research findings into practice at the city level. In this regard, standardization is an effective means of supporting the dissemination of research findings on particularly complex topics such as city resilience. To evaluate the scientific landscape on standardization activities for city resilience from research projects, a literature review was carried out using the Web of Science database. Only 6 of the 22 articles identified actually relate to city resilience and standardization, and a further 23 articles were found on so-called Workshop Agreements to provide evidence of the use of standardization activities in research projects in general. They were mainly published in the last five years and dealt little with standardization. The results confirm the lack of relevant scientific publications, and therefore, research should focus on standardization activities in research projects in general and on city resilience in particular.
