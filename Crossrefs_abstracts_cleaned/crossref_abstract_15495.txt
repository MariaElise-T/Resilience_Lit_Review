 Drawing on governmental statements, press releases and major news reports on COVID-19 related measures, support and social issues, we illustrate and examine the challenges families are facing in Singapore during the pandemic. Employing a dual approach, we illustrate the extent of various institutional support and resources for families offered by the government in tandem with social distancing measures to restrict social activities, and closure of non-essential business, and also document issues related to the economy, education, family interactions and mental well-being of families from different social backgrounds. This approach enables us to show the extent to which Singaporean families have adapted to the different economic and social stressors and how institutional support has been utilized as a catalyst to resilience. The pandemic as a force of social change demands urgent research on the social impact on and resilience of families in Singapore. Future research directions should include childrenâ€™s development with the interaction of family socioeconomic conditions, focus on mental well-being of all generations in the family, continuous safeguard of victims of domestic violence, empowerment, and investigations of the shifting family values. A concerted research strategy will offer the opportunity for a better understanding of the paradigm shift experienced by Singaporean families, and, to identify policy implications on strengthening the resilience of families.
