AbstractObjectiveTo validate the Family Resilience Assessment Scale (FRAS) in Chinese family caregivers.BackgroundCaregiver burden among family caregivers is a growing social issue. Family resilience is a crucial protective factor for easing caregiver burden. The FRAS is specifically designed to evaluate family resilience. However, the factor structure and validity of the FRAS have not yet been examined among Chinese family caregivers.MethodData were collected from 323 Chinese family caregivers. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were adopted to determine the factor structure and model fit. Concurrent validity and internal consistency were also studied.ResultsEFA analysis yielded a 42‐item five‐factor structure of the FRAS, which demonstrated satisfactory model fit by CFA analysis. The five‐factor model FRAS also showed adequate concurrent validity and internal consistency (α = 0.724–0.963).ConclusionThe proposed five‐factor FRAS is likely a valid and reliable scale for evaluating the family resilience level of family caregivers in Chinese communities.ImplicationsThe present study recommends the use of the FRAS in family caregiving research to facilitate intervention development by social professionals for promoting family resilience and reducing caregiver burden in Chinese communities.
