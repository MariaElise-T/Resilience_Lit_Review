Abstract
The focus of this study is on the influence of urban ‘woods’ on people’s quality of life in disadvantaged neighbourhoods investigated via the lens of architecture in a Sub-Saharan metropolis. The new intra-Covid Urban Agenda acknowledges that current urban and state-wide resilience management plans, policies, and practices of neighbourhood are failing. While the architectural sector— tasked with enhancing people’s quality of life, must promote more environmentally sustainable approaches to human-made surroundings, its design, and its management. The increasing attention on people’s health and well-being in human-made surroundings, as the intra-covid renaissance of a new age unfolds, calls into question the role of society’s environmental relationships. The study explicates ecologic, epidemiologic, and psychologic engaging scenarios. A city’s environment redesigned as Eco-equitable Community Absorbent Spaces (ECaS) can foster neighbourhoods with economic, mental, and physical cohesion— that in part encourage habitat disaster risk reduction and the health of the citizenry, when inclusive of all stakeholders’ ambition.
