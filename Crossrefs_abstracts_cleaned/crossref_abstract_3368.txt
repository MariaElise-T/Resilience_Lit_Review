Abstract
We address the resilient event-triggered energy-to-peak (RETEP) control problem of NCSs. The gain of the controller is impacted by uncertainty, and bound by a certain norm. By applying an appropriate Lyapunov function, we first propose a condition to ensure that the closed-loop NCS is asymptotically stable (AS) with a given energy-to-peak performance (EPP) index under zero initial conditions. Then, we present a design of the gain and trigger matrix of the needed RETEP controller. Finally, a simulation example is applied to validate the proposed controller RETEP control method.
