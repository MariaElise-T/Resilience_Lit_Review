PurposeOur study advances theory in supply chain resilience (SCRes) by identifying and describing the mechanisms through which interorganizational relationships (IORs) contribute to SCRes.Design/methodology/approachWe employ a multi-method conceptual development design combining structured and narrative review of the literature, supported by illustrative case studies. A four-stage refinement process was used for data reduction, and analysis was informed by complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory.FindingsOur findings identify connectivity, collectivity and scalability as key mechanisms through which relationships between organizations contribute to SCRes. These mechanisms draw on IOR elements of information sharing, decision synchronization and incentive alignment to augment self-organization and emergence, and adaptation and coevolution via modifying/advancing resilience strategies and practices.Originality/valueOur study advances theory and practice of SCRes by expounding on how connectivity, collectivity and scalability act as mechanisms that drive and diffuse the contribution of resilient strategies/practices to resilience capability. This is significant for strategic alignment between IORs and SCRes.
