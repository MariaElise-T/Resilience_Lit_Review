AbstractA brief review of research findings regarding twins living apart is presented. This review is followed by a look into the lives of a pair of monozygotic male twins who have lived in different continents for many years, but who stay closely connected. The reasons behind their decision and its impact on their behavioral resemblance and social relationship quality are examined. The next section summarizes recent studies that address the management of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies, paternity testing in multiple pregnancies, trisomies in twin pregnancies and the roots of resilience. The final portion of this article presents human-interest stories involving reunited Brazilian twins, a new resource for twins with disabled co-twins, twins separated in the Secret of the Nile television series, a new book about Dr Josef Mengele and his horrific twin experiments conducted at the Auschwitzâ€“Birkenau concentration camp, and a pair of twins dedicated to helping others.
