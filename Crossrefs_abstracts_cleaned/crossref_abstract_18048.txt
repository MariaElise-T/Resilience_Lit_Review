Background: Resilience is a dynamic system for successful adjustment with various circumstances, particularly adverse living conditions. In this respect, the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) can simultaneously assess the individual, relational, contextual, and cultural resources of resilience. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of CYRM-12 in Iranian youth. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total number of 440 students aged 14 - 18 years were enrolled. The students were studying in middle and high schools (the academic year of 2019 - 2020) in the city of Islamshahr, Iran, and were selected using random cluster sampling. Data collection questionnaires included the CYRM-12, CYRM-28, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS), and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: Our results supported the one-factor structure and showed that the given measure had a good fit (χ2/DF = 2.63, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.95, and GFI = 0.95). The internal consistency measured by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was also satisfactory (0.79). As well, the test-retest reliability determined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (with a two-week interval) was obtained 0.70. Moreover, this scale had acceptable convergent and divergent validities. Conclusions: The Persian version of the CYRM-12 delivered good reliability and validity to assess resilience in Iranian youth.
