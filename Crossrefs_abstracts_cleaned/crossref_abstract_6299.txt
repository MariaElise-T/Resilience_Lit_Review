BackgroundEvidence‐based approaches and early intervention have improved the long‐term prognosis of individuals with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the therapeutic processes involved in individual therapy in first‐episode psychosis. A comprehensive psychosocial/psychiatric programme for this population, NAVIGATE, includes an individual therapy component, individual resiliency training (IRT). Fidelity of clinicians’ adherence to the IRT protocol has been collected to ensure proper implementation of this manual‐based intervention. These data can provide insight into the elements of the therapeutic process in this intervention.Materials and MethodsTo achieve this goal, we first examined the factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale with exploratory factor analysis. Second, we explored the relationships among the IRT fidelity ratings with clinician years of experience and years of education, as well as client's baseline symptom severity and duration of untreated psychosis.Results and ConclusionsResults supported a 2‐factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale. Correlations between clinician years of education and fidelity ratings were statistically significant.
