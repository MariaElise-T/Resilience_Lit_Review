We proposed a new type of aggressive concrete structure in this paper. The proposed structure consists of concrete columns reinforced by ultra-high strength rebar with spiral groove on its surface. Four circular concrete columns were fabricated and tested under cyclic reversed lateral force and constant compression to investigate the seismic behavior of the proposed columns. Test results have shown that the concrete column had high resilience, and use of the ultra-high strength rebar with spiral groove on its surface could significantly mitigate damage degree and reduce residual deformation of concrete column. Based on the experimental results, we developed a model to simulate the hysteresis loop of the proposed resilient column and an equation to assess the equivalent viscous damping ratio, which was indispensable to performance-based design of the resilient column. Very good agreement was observed between the measured results and the theoretical predictions.
