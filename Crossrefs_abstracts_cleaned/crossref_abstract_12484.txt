The resilience assessment method of hybrid AC-DC distribution grid is the key and basis of measuring the tolerance of the distribution network in face of extreme events and testing the effect of the resilience improvement strategy of the distribution network. This paper fully considers the characteristics of different extreme natural disasters and proposes a targeted resilience assessment method. For natural disasters, the fault rate model of the line under the influence of the disaster is constructed, and the fault set is generated based on Monte Carlo sampling. According to the operating characteristics, a set of evaluation indicators focusing on the core characteristics of resilience, including capability of strain, defense and recoverability, is constructed. The objective weight of each indicator and the comprehensive assessment results are obtained based relatively on the entropy weight method and the approximate ideal solution sorting method.
