The notion of 'resilience' is rapidly emerging as a research topic in its own right, with the notion of 'social resilience' rapidly gaining importance. Yet, due to the relative novelty of the research field, discussions about processes of social resilience are not yet fully developed,
 especially with regard to how the inbuilt 'memory' of a local community helps shape resilience pathways (social memory). Interlinkages between social memory and community resilience are the focus of this study, with emphasis on analysis of the importance of rites, traditions and social learning
 processes for shaping community resilience/vulnerability.
