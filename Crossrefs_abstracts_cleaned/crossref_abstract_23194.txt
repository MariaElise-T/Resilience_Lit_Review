Adolescents’ ability to function well under adversity relies on a network of interrelated support systems. This study investigated how consecutive age groups differ in the interactions between their support systems. A secondary data analysis of cross‐sectional studies that assessed individual, caregiver, and contextual resources using the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (Ungar & Liebenberg, 2005) in 13‐ to 18‐year‐olds in Canada (N = 2,311) and South Africa (N = 3,039) was conducted applying network analysis. Individual and contextual systems generally showed the highest interconnectivity. While the interconnectivity between the individual and caregiver system declined in the Canadian sample, a u‐shaped pattern was found for South Africa. The findings give first insights into cross‐cultural and context‐dependent patterns of interconnectivity between fundamental resource systems during adolescence.
