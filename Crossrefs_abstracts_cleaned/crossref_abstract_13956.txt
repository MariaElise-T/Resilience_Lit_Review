As humans, we are always targets of many positive and negative life events in which we would show
differences in dealing with those events. In this study, the aim was to investigate how individuals react
to stressful situations through the concept of resilience. Therefore, it was aimed to test the role of
individual characteristics of affect and coping styles in addition to receiving support from family and
social environment on resilience. The role of resilience in life satisfaction was also investigated. A
survey was used including demographic questions, ego resilience scale, positive and negative affect
scale, stress coping styles inventory, and satisfaction with life scale. Target of the study was individuals
who were over 18 years of age and 403 participants were reached through snowball sampling. Seventysix
percent of the participants were female (n=310) and 24% of them were male (n=93). Hypothesized
model was tested by using path analysis. Study results showed that positive affect, optimistic coping
style and confident coping style were significant predictors of resilience as individual characteristics in
addition to receiving social support. Resilience was found as a significant predictor of life satisfaction.
Moreover, resilience was also found as a significant mediator of the relationships between positive
affect, optimistic coping, confident coping styles, receiving social support and life satisfaction.
Importance of the study in the field of psychology and suggestions for future research were also
discussed with relevant literature
