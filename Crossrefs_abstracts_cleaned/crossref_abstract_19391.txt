The unprecedented outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a huge global health and economic crisis. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which the resilience of a person is associated with the quality of life (QoL) of adults amongst Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of adults in Saudi Arabia. A total of 385 adults voluntarily participated in and completed the survey. The quality of life was measured using the “World Health Organization QoL”. The “Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale” instrument was also used to assess resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst the 385 participants, 179 (46%) showed a good QoL, and 205 (54%) reported a relatively poor QoL. The resilience was found to be significantly associated with QoL. The study further revealed that gender-based differences were dominant in the QoL; the men respondents reported a significantly higher QoL in all the domains in comparison to the women respondents. The gender, income, and psychological health and interaction effect of resilience and age explained 40% of the variance in the total score of QoL. In reference to the predictors of the physical health domain of QoL, resilience, gender, and psychological health were significantly associated with the physical health domain of the QoL (R2 = 0.26, p = 0.001). It was also noted that gender was not associated with the social relationships and environmental domains of QoL (p > 0.05). Findings showed a statistically significant association between the score of QoL and resilience, age, gender, income, and psychological health. These findings highlight the significant contribution of gender-based differences, psychological health, and resilience on the domains of QoL.
