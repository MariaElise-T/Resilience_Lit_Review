On Oct. 18–19, 2022, in Salt Lake City, Utah, National Governors Association (NGA) Chair, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, and Vice Chair, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, held the first of four roundtables to discuss the 2022‐2023 NGA Chair's Initiative: Strengthening Youth Mental Health, according to an NGA news release. A strong state contingent was represented, including Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania, according to an NGA news release. Representatives from these states were joined by over 50 community leaders, academic experts, and representatives from partner organizations and funders. The convention centered on practical solutions for the first of the initiative's four pillars: prevention and resilience building. Discussions forged connections across the public and private sectors, shared best practices across states and territories to amplify their impact, and aligned on ways that governors can further support youth mental health. Discussions suggested that a set of common tools should emerge to successfully drive prevention and resilience building efforts and that.
