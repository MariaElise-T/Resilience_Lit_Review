PurposeThe study of supply chain disruption (SCD) and supply chain resilience (SCR) remains to be studied deeply in the field of business management. The purpose of this paper is to showcase a framework of SCR strategies to reduce the adverse effects of SCD using systematic literature review and data visualization.Design/methodology/approachUsing a systematic literature review approach, the paper explores the concepts of supply chain disruption and supply chain resilience. Through rigorous systematic screening, authors studied papers on both the concepts and have proposed a framework for the same. The authors also have used data visualization and network diagram approaches for better understanding of the topic.FindingsThe systematic literature review of both the concepts brings out some exciting results which give a new direction to supply chain field. The outcome of this research also outlines numerous future research direction, which will be useful for the research community.Practical implicationsThe numerous strategies of SCR should be implemented by manufacturing as well as a service organization. The framework reported in this research help academician and practitioners to understand SCR and to easily overcome any level of disruption. Supply chain managers must also formulate strategies accordingly and make plans to continually expand the system.Originality/valueThis research is the first such attempt to showcase a formal systematic framework and co-occurrence networks as well as overlay networks of SCR and SCD.
