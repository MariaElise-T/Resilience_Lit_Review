The application of livelihood resilience theory to villages that have been resettled due to coal mining provides insights into the levels and impediments of livelihood resilience under different resettlement models. Such an exploration holds critical significance for enhancing the livelihood resilience of the resettled households and promoting sustainable development in coal mining areas. Grounded in the theoretical framework of livelihood resilience and considering the realities of mining areas, by referring to existing studies, this study devises an evaluative index system. Utilizing the TOPSIS model to calculate the level of livelihood resilience, and we delve into the impediments to livelihood resilience of households that resettled under different models using the obstacle model. The results indicate the following: (1) Overall, the level of livelihood resilience in areas resettled due to coal mining of Huaibei City is low. Significant disparities exist among the households resettled under different models in terms of buffering capacity, self-organizing ability, and learning ability. (2) Factors such as the quantity of labor, policy awareness, and participation in village collective meetings significantly influence householdsâ€™ livelihood resilience, albeit to varying degrees across different resettlement models. (3) Future interventions should address the challenges faced by the four types of resettled households by increasing employment opportunities, intensifying policy advocacy, and augmenting investments in education resources to elevate the livelihood standards of various households.
