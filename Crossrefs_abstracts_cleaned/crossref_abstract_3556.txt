The concepts of resilience and coping share an intertwined relationship with each other to the extent thatquestions arise whether the two are different constructs or one encompasses the other. The present study aimed at analysing the correlated and conjoint factorial nature of two popular measures of resilience and coping, namely the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC); and the Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ) in the Indian population. The sample consisted of 184 participants within the age range of 18-30 years. Results depicted that adaptive coping styles correlated with resilience. The factor analysis of CD-RISC provided two factors, whereas CSQ provided four different factors. The joint factor analysis provided four factors with significant overlap between adaptive coping and resilience.
