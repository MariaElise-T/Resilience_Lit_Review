This paper pursues the theme of resilience in psychological functioning using the example of Harry Potter as traumatised child who manages to survive his early adversive experiences to become a mature and caring older boy. By contrast, Lord Voldemort, the villain in the stories, also has a history of early deprivation but the outcome for him is highly antisocial.
We live in exciting times for increased understanding of the often subtle events which now seem to form the initial conditions which may lead to such differences. A selection of these insights from research in attachment and early trauma is provided to illustrate the theme.
