Introduction. Contemporary studies suggest present affective and stress related difficulties such as depressivenes, anxiousness and related states among students of different levels and backgrounds of studies[1,2] hardships that might appear later on, during education and professional activities, depending of the duration and mood severity[3], but also different factors that might play potential protective roles during the whole process[4,5]. Objective. To examine the mediation effects of variables positive lateral generalization, perceived social support and self-compassion in a relationship between depression and anxiety with resilience. Method. A cross-sectional research was conducted in Serbian speaking area on 147 students (108 females (73,5%) and 39 males (26,5%)) of different courses and levels of education, and six different hypothethical single mediator models were examined between anxiety, depression and resilience with the intercession of three mediators: perceived social support, lateral generalisation and self-compassion. Results. Results indicate a non-significant relationship between anxiety and perceived social support (r=-0.09; p>0.05) so that assumption for mediation analysis was not met for furter examination for this model. Perceived social support did not mediate the relationship between depression and resilience significantly (b=0.02; p >0.05, 95% Bca CI [-0.03, 0.08]) which was also the case for lateral generalization (b=0.03; p>0.05, 95% Bca CI [-0.01, 0.10]) as well as in the case between anxiety and resilience (b=0.02; p>0.05, 95% Bca CI [-0.01, 0.09]), whilst significant mediation effect of self-compassion was observed both in relationship between depression and resilience (b=-0.24 p<0.01, 95% Bca CI [-0.38, -0.13]; PM=0.50) as well as in the case of anxiety and resilience (b=-0.23; p<0.01 95% Bca CI [-0.38, -0.12]; PM=0.48). Conclusion. Results indicate a significant contribution of self-compassion in states of depressiveness and anxiousness and its potential role in resilience and well-being, but the directions of effects is not possible to discern due to the cross-sectional nature of the research.
