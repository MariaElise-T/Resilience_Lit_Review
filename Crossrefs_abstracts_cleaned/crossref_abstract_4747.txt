Objectives:Existing approaches to coaching leaders for resilience are fragmented and often drawn from the developmental or clinical context but little empirical research has investigated the leadership perspective on resilience. The objective of this study was to establish how leaders conceptualise resilience in their context in order to inform approaches to enhancing and supporting the growth of resilience by coaches working with this target group.Design:This constructivist grounded theory study was set within a pragmatic paradigm and gathered qualitative interview data to examine the concept of resilience from a leadership perspective.Methods:Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight senior leaders who had been coached by seven different coaches to gather their perspective on the meaning of resilience in leadership.Results:Resilience emerged as operating differently in relation to the past, the present and the future. Leaders in this study also described resilience as a ‘resource’ or fuel, which suggests that working with skills alone may not be sufficient to enhance resilience. A wider conceptualisation of resilience is proposed that includes both capabilities and the capacity for resilience. Capabilities encompass skills or strategies, while capacity is a more transient resource. Values emerged as important and may be an area for future investigation.Conclusions:Conceptualising resilience as having a stable capability component and a more transient capacity element has implications for coaching practices aimed at enhancing resilience in the leadership context. It suggests that working with capabilities alone may have a limited impact and that coaches wishing to enhance resilience may want to address the more transient ‘capacity’ element as well as values.
