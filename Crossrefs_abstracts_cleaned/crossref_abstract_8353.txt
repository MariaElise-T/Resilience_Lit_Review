Purpose: In light of ongoing challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and globalization, it is critical to have resilient food industry supply chains that can operate effectively in uncertain conditions. This study aims to contribute to this effort by investigating current trends and developments in the area of food industry supply chain resilience and identifying potential areas for improvement. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 122 articles published between 2008 and 2023, utilizing multiple quantitative measures such as bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Findings: Our study identifies five distinct clusters of research on food industry supply chain resilience. We found that food systems resilience and public health is the most extensively studied aspect, indicating the importance of ensuring that our food supply chains are capable of withstanding disruptions to maintain public health. The other four clusters–seafood supply chain resilience and risk management; digital and sustainable food systems; agri-food Industry 4.0 and sustainability; and meat production and the food industry–each represent important areas for future research and development. Originality: To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a bibliometric approach to analyze the resilience of food supply chain systems. By doing so, we provide a unique and original contribution to the existing literature on food supply chain systems, as prior bibliometric analyses have not specifically focused on the resilience aspect. Practical implications: Our findings highlight the need for continued research and development in the area of food industry supply chain resilience. By identifying the most pressing areas for improvement and future research, our study can help inform policy decisions and guide industry efforts to create more resilient food supply chains that can adapt to changing conditions.
