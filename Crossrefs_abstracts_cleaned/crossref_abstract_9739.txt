Summary: In this article we explore a continuum of interventions that offer at-risk children and youth experience in outdoor wilderness environments. Though these experiences are thought to enhance the well-being of participants, the mechanisms by which programming in natural environments promotes health have been poorly understood. In this article we discuss different types of outdoor programmes in which social workers and allied professionals participate, linking programme goals and outcomes to research on mitigating risk and promoting resilience in at-risk populations.Findings: Findings are based on qualitative data gathered as part of regular programme evaluations and a separate study of 14 participantsâ€™ reactions to programming. Results show favourable outcomes in terms of relationship building and a sense of spirituality and purpose, though there was little increased awareness of environmental issues. Follow-up and support after programming helped to reinforce changes made during the outdoor experience.Applications:These case studies, combined with a review of the literature, provide the basis for a theoretically sound approach to understanding the health-enhancing mechanisms that operate through outdoor experience-based education and treatment. Similarities between the gains made in well-being and resilience are highlighted.
