Abstract
Nursing terminologies like the Omaha System are foundational in realizing the vision of formal representation of social determinants of health (SDOH) data and whole-person health across biological, behavioral, social, and environmental domains. This study objective was to examine standardized consumer-generated SDOH data and resilience (strengths) using the MyStrengths+MyHealth (MSMH) app built using Omaha System. Overall, 19 SDOH concepts were analyzed including 19 Strengths, 175 Challenges, and 76 Needs with additional analysis around Income Challenges. Data from 919 participants presented an average of 11(SD = 6.1) Strengths, 21(SD = 15.8) Challenges, and 15(SD = 14.9) Needs. Participants with at least one Income Challenge (n = 573) had significantly (P &lt; .001) less Strengths [9.4(6.4)], more Challenges [27.4(15.5)], and more Needs [15.1(14.9)] compared to without an Income Challenge (n = 337) Strengths [13.4(4.5)], Challenges [10.5(8.9)], and Needs [5.1(10.0)]. This standards-based approach to examining consumer-generated SDOH and resilience data presents a great opportunity in understanding 360-degree whole-person health as a step towards addressing health inequities.
