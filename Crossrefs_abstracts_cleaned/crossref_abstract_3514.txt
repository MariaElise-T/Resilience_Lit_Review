The outbreak of emergencies has triggered people’s thinking about the ability of urban emergency management system to deal with emergencies. Under the current situation, the traditional urban emergency management mode has been unable to cope with the new problems of unexpected events. The author believes that the government led urban emergency management system and social organizations, enterprises, non-profit organizations and the public should form an “emergency social network”. Their collaboration is actually based on their self-organizing operation, making full use of mutual feedback and feedback with the environment, adaptively changing the organic combination of mutual relations, so as to make the city as a whole. It is a complex operation process of the system from disorder to order. This process is not only to improve the resilience of the city by optimizing the management function of the government emergency system, but also to achieve the overall optimization of the system by combining the improvement of the response ability of social organizations and the improvement of citizens’ quality, so as to achieve the response performance of “the whole is greater than the sum of parts”.
