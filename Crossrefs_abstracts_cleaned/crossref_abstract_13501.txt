It is very important to evaluate the structural behavior of shield tunnel lining reasonably to ensure the safe operation and maintenance of subway trains. In this paper, by virtue of the resilience theory, the resilience evaluation of the existing shield tunnel lining induced by the symmetrical excavation of adjacent foundation pit is conducted using the numerical simulation. Firstly, the structural behavior index of the shield tunnel lining is defined. Moreover, using the evolution of structural behavior index along with the symmetrical excavation steps of adjacent foundation pit, the calculation method of the resilience index of the shield tunnel lining and grade of resilience are proposed. Secondly, numerical simulation is conducted to compare the degree of influence of three different block symmetrical excavation methods of the adjacent foundation pit on the structural deformation of existing shield tunnel lining. Finally, based on the proposed resilience evaluation method, the structural deformation index and the resilience index of the existing shield tunnel lining are calculated under three different block symmetrical excavation methods, which indicates that the control effect of different block symmetrical excavation methods of the adjacent foundation pit varies greatly. Moreover, it is necessary to adopt the fine excavation method of foundation pit by sections to better control the deformation of the existing shield tunnel lining.
