AbstractIntroductionAccess to health services is a major challenge in developing countries in general, particularly those affected by insecurity. The availability of sufficient quantity and quality of equitably distributed healthcare workforce is a major obstacle, yet it is an essential pillar of an effective and efficient national health system. Burkina Faso, similar to other countries in the Sahel, has been affected by an unprecedented security crisis that has severely tested the functionality of health facilities and the availability of healthcare workforce.ObjectiveTo describe the landscape of healthcare workforce and to analyse the actions taken by the government and other stakeholders to improve the resilience of the system and the retention of healthcare workers in the context of major security challenges.MethodsThis is a transversal, descriptive and analytical study carried out in Burkina Faso in 2023 through a documentary review, analyses of databases collected from health districts and regional directorates, focus groups and a national triangulation workshop with key informants.ResultsThe study shows that, with the closure and minimal functioning of certain health facilities in security‐challenged areas, healthcare workforceare concentrated in the urban areas of regional and district capitals, to the detriment of rural areas. Some staff become in an irregular situation regarding the administration. To strengthen resilience to the crisis, the main solutions have been implemented: (i) enhancing the community platform with the recruitment of 15,000 community‐based health volunteers, (ii) delegating tasks to community health agents, (iii) simplified approaches, (iv) advanced health posts and mobile clinics, (v) redeployment to the most stable structures, (vi) thinking about legislation in crisis situations.ConclusionCommunity resilience through the delegation of tasks to community‐based health workers and strengthening of the community health platform has helped ensure the continuity of care in insecure areas. However, the optimization of innovative and attractive strategies will further improve the retention and return of healthcare workers in rural areas affected.
