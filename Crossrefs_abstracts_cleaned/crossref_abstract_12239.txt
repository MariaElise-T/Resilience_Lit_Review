Background: The goal of this review paper is to investigate factors that contribute to project managers' crisis resilience through a systematic review of the literature and bibliometric analysis using VOXviewer. Methods: Using the PRISMA framework for systematic literature, 55 peer-reviewed articles published between 1993 and 2022 that met our criteria were identified through a structured keyword search in the Scopus and WoS databases. Results: The systematic review and bibliometric analysis reveal eight clusters, which we further categorise into four determinants. In the context of the roles of project managers, the results of a comparative analysis reveal four prominent factors for enhancing crisis resilience: 1. leadership; 2. interpersonal skill; 3. agility; 4. risk management and vulnerabilityÂ . These factors are essential for developing project managers who are less susceptible to future crises and disasters. This study has exhaustively characterised the possibilities and capacities of crisis resilience in terms of competency, integration, collaboration, and novelty; however, the search was restricted to a small number of databases and a short period of time, which could be explored in future research. Conclusions: According to the findings, most previous research on crisis resilience focused on emergency preparedness and was primarily conducted in Western and American studies. There is a lack of a holistic perspective on crisis resilience, which will be developed. We believe that international collaboration efforts to establish a platform for the exchange of knowledge between Western and American nations and ASEAN members are necessary.
