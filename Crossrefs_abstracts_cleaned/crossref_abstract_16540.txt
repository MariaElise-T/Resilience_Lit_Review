Changes in the organizational environment (e.g. IT, covid-19, age of employees) are driving organizational change, including government organization. Several studies have shown that 70% of change programs fail to run with various causes. The role of humans as a factor that influences the success of organizational change is necessary to research employee commitment to change by looking at the factors that affect it. This study aims to analyze, interpret and evaluate resource management practices, especially about the influence of Organizational Culture, Employee Resilience, and Employee Readiness to Change on Employee Affective Commitment to Change. Data collection was carried out through a survey at a government-owned academy in Indonesia with 185 respondents. The data were analyzed using variant-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) or Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM). As a result, Externally Oriented Organizational Culture significantly affects Employee Affective Commitment to Change through Employee Readiness to Change as a mediator variable. On the other hand, Employee Resilience has no significant effect on Employee Affective Commitment to Change
