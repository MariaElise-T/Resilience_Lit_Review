At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill‐defined determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person‐centered multidimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life‐long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury, or disease.
