Resilience represents one of the key components of the vulnerability of ecological systems and may refer to different levels of biological organization, from populations to the biosphere. A short description is given on the concept of resilience applied to the levels that are directly involved in ecological risk assessment (ERA): populations, communities, and ecosystems. The opportunities and challenges for measuring and quantifying resilience are discussed. Finally, some suggestions for introducing the resilience concept in regulatory ERA are proposed.
