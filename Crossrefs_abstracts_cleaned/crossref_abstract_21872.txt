Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the influence of empathic ability and ego resilience on the ability of dental hygiene students to maintain good interpersonal relationships.
Methods: Data were collected between March 1 and March 31, 2021, through a self-report questionnaire. The subjects for the study were 189 dental hygiene students who were selected using convenience sampling.
Results: Ability in interpersonal relationships was found to have a statistically positive correlation with empathic ability (r = 0.338, p < .01 ) and ego resilience (r = 0.649, p < .01). Stepwise multiple regression revealed that ego resilience (Î² = 0.521, p = 0.001) was a significant predictor and accounted for 45.8% of ability in interpersonal relationships.
Conclusions: The ability to conduct good interpersonal relationships needs to be increased in dental hygiene students by conducting an efficient program to teach ego resilience.
