Aims We aimed to evaluate the correlation between preoperative and postoperative resilience scores and postoperative outcomes at minimum 2-year follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Methods We prospectively enrolled 98 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. We assessed resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale. Postoperatively, we obtained patient-reported outcomes measures including American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health-10 at minimum 2-year follow-up. We used Spearman correlation coefficients ( r) to assess the relationship between variables. Results Ninety-one of 98 patients (93%) provided follow-up at an average of 32 months. Preoperative Brief Resilience Scale did not show a statistically significant correlation with American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons ( r = 0.156; p = 0.142). However, preoperative Brief Resilience Scale showed statistically significant correlations with Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health-10 ( r = 0.290; p = 0.005) and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation ( r = 0.259; p = 0.014). Postoperative Brief Resilience Scale showed statistically significant correlations with American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons ( r = 0.291; p = 0.005), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation ( r = 0.384; p < 0.001) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health-10 ( r = 0.515; p < 0.001). Discussion Resilience may be a valuable predictor of patients at risk of having suboptimal outcomes after rotator cuff repair and a target to improve surgical outcomes through non-surgical means.
