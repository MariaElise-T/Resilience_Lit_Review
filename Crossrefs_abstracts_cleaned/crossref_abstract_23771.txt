AimTo evaluate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within the empty‐nest older adults population in poor rural areas of the Hunan province of China, and to explore the effects of resilience and affective balance on cognitive functioning within this specific population.MethodsA cross‐sectional, multistage, random cluster survey was administered to participants from March 2013 to December 2014 in the Hunan province. There were a total of 1164 participants. These participants were empty‐nest older adults who were residing in poor rural areas of the Hunan province. The data was collected in two stages. In stage 1, the participants were administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for screening cognitive impairment. In stage 2, the participants were screened for any potential cognitive impairment, were administered a series of neuropsychological tests and received a definitive diagnosis for MCI, if the criteria were met. Resilience and affect balance were assessed by the Chinese modified version of the Stress Resilience Quotient and the Affect Balance Scale.ResultsThe prevalence of MCI was 38.40% within this empty‐nest older adult population. Significant differences were found between MCI and non‐MCI empty‐nest older adults specific to resilience and affect balance. Path analysis showed that resilience mediated the relationship between MCI and affect balance.ConclusionsResilience and affect balance were less prominent within the MCI empty‐nest older adults than those in the non‐MCI group. The results suggest that resilience is a mediating variable between MCI and affect balance. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 222–227.
