Background: 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune, rheumatic inflammatory disease
that can cause significant morbidity with evident psychological impacts and obvious harm to quality-of-life that require
the patient to adapt treatment.


Objective: 
Assessment of resilience and the self-reported treatment adhesion behaviors of patients with SLE, investigating
which of these factors are associated to resilience.


Method: 
Cross-sectional study of 40 women with SLE. A questionnaire with social demographic data, health history and
the Wagnild Young Resilience Scale were used.


Results: 
62.5% followed the medical treatment properly but 55% found it difficult. 27.5% of the patients presented low
resilience, 57.5% medium and 15% high resilience. Resilience was associated in the chi-square test (p-value < 0.05) with
the variables work, understanding SLE, trying to find out about SLE, following the treatment correctly, difficulty in
following the treatment and stopping some activity because of the disease. In the correlation analysis, resilience was
associated with age (-0.3960), number of working hours (0.5533), specialized treatment duration (-0.8103) and disease
duration from diagnosis (-0.8014).


Conclusion: 
Patients with high resilience tended to follow treatment correctly, tried to understand the disease and adhered
more to the treatment to avoid risks and promote protection factors. Therefore knowledge of resilience in patients with
SLE is necessary. It is important that the state takes necessary actions to facilitate access to treatment, to educational
programs and to medical support. Awareness and counselling sessions must be initiated to develop and promote individual
capacities to learn how to tackle with the disease for which psychological support of family and doctors can play a
significant role.
