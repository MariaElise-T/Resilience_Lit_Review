 This research examines how deep travel habits in the form of habit formation and reduced substitutability between tourism travel and other leisure goods impact travel resilience after COVID-19. Using microdata for almost 3000 tourists in Andalusia (Spain), we relate post-pandemic outbreak tourism participation to pre-pandemic travelling intensity and whether taking a vacation is considered a priority good. In doing so, we control for standard sociodemographic characteristics and province fixed effects. Our results clearly show that the probability of continuing travelling during the summer of 2020 is positively associated with pre-pandemic travel intensity and tourism being considered a priority leisure activity. Travel resilience is found to be strongly associated with income, education level and the tenure of a second residence.
