The uncertainty environment brought about by COVID-19 has broken the original stable hierarchical network structure and the whole supply and demand system of the tourism supply chain (TSC), which has brought heavy losses to the tourism industry. Using the case research and consensual qualitative research (CQR) method, taking the real situation and perception of individual supply chain members as a window, supplemented by the narrative insertion of Lijiang Yulong Tourism Co., Ltd., Lijiang Old Town and Yulong Snow Mountain scenic areas, the general laws of the vulnerability and resilience of the TSC were glimpsed. The results show that there are vulnerability factors in the TSC including the supply side, demand side, government side, destination economic structure and supply chain attributes, which lead to the interruption and damage of the TSC after the outbreak of the pandemic. At the same time, Chinaâ€™s overall economic environment, tourism demand side, supply side, government side and market participants all have resilience elements. Behind the vulnerability, there is a power of recovery and opportunities for innovation and change. The TSC shows a trend of restorative growth. Theoretically, it helps to enrich theories of TSC and supply chain management under an emergency crisis. In practice, the response behavior of participants at different levels of the supply chain is also the basis for TSC risk management and formulation of optimization strategies in the future, which helps tourism sustainable development in the uncertain environment.
