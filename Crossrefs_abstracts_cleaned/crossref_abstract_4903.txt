This study investigated literature databases of Google Scholar and Scopus from 1900 to 2021 and reviewed relevant studies conducted to increase transportation infrastructure resilience to flood events. This review has three objectives: (1) determine which natural hazard or natural disaster had the most vulnerability studies; (2) identify which infrastructure type was most prevalent in studies related to flood resilience infrastructure; and (3) investigate the current stage of research. This review was conducted with three stages. Based on stage one, floods have been extremely present in research from 1981 to 2021. Based on stage two, transportation infrastructure was most studied in studies related to flood resilience. Based on stage three, this systematic review focused on a total of 133 peer-reviewed, journal articles written in English. In stage three, six research categories were identified: (1) flood risk analysis; (2) implementation of real-time flood forecasting and prediction; (3) investigation of flood impacts on transportation infrastructure; (4) vulnerability analysis of transportation infrastructure; (5) response and preparatory measures towards flood events; and (6) several other studies that could be related to transportation infrastructure resilience to flood events. Current stage of studies for increasing transportation resilience to flood events was investigated within these six categories. Current stage of studies shows efforts to advance modeling systems, improve data collections and analysis (e.g., real-time data collections, imagery analysis), enhance methodologies to assess vulnerabilities, and more.
