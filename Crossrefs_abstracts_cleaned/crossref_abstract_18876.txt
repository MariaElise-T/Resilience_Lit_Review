            The current study examined the mediating roles of resilience and emotional regulation in the association between childhood trauma and depressive symptoms among individuals who experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Data from 200 women aged 17 to 77 years who were psychiatric outpatients were collected using self-reported questionnaires assessing child adversity, depressive symptoms, resilience, and emotional regulation. A positive correlation was found between a subscale of the ACE-IQ and depression. Childhood trauma was associated with higher risk of depressive symptoms among participants with lower resilience (an association that was partly explained by resilience level [mediation]). Emotional regulation was not a significant mediator in the childhood trauma–depression association. Our findings indicate that resilience is a key mediator between childhood trauma and depression. Individuals who experienced childhood trauma may benefit from evidence-based interventions focused on strengthening resilience and improving coping strategies. [
