 In this paper we consider family aspects of adolescent resilience. It has long been known that there are children who, despite exposure to significant risk factors, show few or no signs of developmental impairment. These children are referred to as "invulnerable' or resilient. A rapidly expanding literature deals with these unexpectedly favorable developmental outcomes. We explore linkages between adolescent development, an important stressor (chronic illness in adolescence), and a key psychosocial environment (the family). Following a broad review of resiliency research, we focus upon what is known about the varying impacts of a specific chronic illness, diabetes, upon adolescent development. In addition, we consider how the family magnifies, diminishes, or otherwise transforms the impact of this illness upon the adolescent patient. Finally, we describe an ongoing research program investigating diabetic adolescent development within the family.
