This study explored South Asian immigrant women survivorsâ€™ perspectives on intimate partner relationships that could lead to severe violence or a homicide and sources of resilience for South Asian immigrant survivors in the United States. The study recruited 16 South Asian immigrant survivors for in-depth interviews and focus groups. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Survivors shared some characteristics of dangerous partner such as controlling behavior, anger issues, infidelity, alcohol and drug problems, and history of childhood abuse. Incidents of severe physical abuse, threats to kill, possession of a weapon, and suspicious behavior led survivors to feel fearful for their lives. Sources of resilience in the community (e.g., support from formal sources of help) and at the individual level (e.g., education) were discussed. The needs for culturally informed services and to generate awareness of services among South Asian immigrants were highlighted.
