There has been much recent research focusing on the resilience of networks, providing theoretical insights into the effective response of real-world systems systems to disasters. However, few studies have analyzed the factors that affect the resilience of networks. And the network operation process varies greatly so that the dynamic behavior of the network is a factor that has to be considered. To bridge these gaps, we analyze the factors affecting dynamic network resilience in terms of network dynamics. There are two main influencing factors: differentiation of failure probability, differentiation of impact. We build a generic resilience model for the network and validate these influencing factors by simulating them in different networks. By summarizing these factors, we point out constructive strategies. These strategies can help dynamic networks enhance network resilience, which is an important criterion for reducing network failures in real-world systems.
