The present research is an attempt to find out the impact of work-family conflict on employee resilience and the role of Self-affirmative interventions in building the resilience and mitigating the impact. A total of 55 interviews were conducted. This paper proposes that work-life conflict during Covid-19 had a negative impact on psychological resilience. Moreover, various self-affirmation strategies adopted by the respondents during Covid-19 helped them to combat the work-family conflict and stress created by it. A research need has been identified by the previous research to find out the role of self-affirmation interventions in aligning the values and needs with changed or unexpected environments to tackle the work-family conflict. Moreover, the relationship between the psychological resilience and self-affirmation interventions has not been explored previously, particularly in the Indian Context.
