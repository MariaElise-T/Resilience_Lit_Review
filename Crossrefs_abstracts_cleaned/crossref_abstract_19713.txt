AbstractBackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACE) might predispose to and resilience might protect against chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). We studied whether ACE are positively associated with CNCP, whether resilience was negatively associated with CNCP and whether resilience buffered a potential association of ACE with CNCP.MethodsA cross‐sectional survey (N = 2,425) representative for the adult German general population was conducted in 2013. The following questionnaires were used: Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire for CNCP stages; Childhood Trauma Screener for ACE; Brief Resilient Coping Scale for resilience; Patient Health Questionnaire 4 for psychological symptom burden; Giessen Subjective Complaints List for somatic symptom burden. To test the association of ACE and resilience with CNCP stages, logistic regression analyses including sociodemographic variables and psychological and somatic symptom burden as possible confounders were calculated.ResultsNo statistically significant associations between any CNCP and disabling CNCP respectively with physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; emotional and physical neglect if compared to no chronic pain were found in uni‐ and multivariate analyses. There was a small effect of combined ACE and a small attenuating effect of resilience on any and disabling CNCP in univariate, but not in multivariate analysis. Large associations were found between age > 65 years with any CNCP (OR 6.51 [95% confidence interval 3.38 to 12.51)] and disabling CNCP (OR 9.33 [95% confidence interval 2.39 to 36.41]), respectively, if compared to no pain.ConclusionsThere was no pain‐proneness by single and combined ACE for and no protection by resilience for any and for disabling CNCP in the general adult German population.SignificanceThere is no pain‐proneness due to adverse childhood experiences for any and disabling chronic noncancer pain. Resilience does not protect against any and disabling chronic noncancer pain. Older age is the strongest predictor of any and disabling chronic noncancer pain.
