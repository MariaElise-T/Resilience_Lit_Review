PurposeUnderstanding the technical and socioeconomic dimensions to resilience is core to making a business case for property-level flood risk adaptation. The study investigates the socioeconomic factors that impact the technical dimensions to property-level flood risk adaptation, and whether there is a typology of households adopting similar adaptation measures in Port Harcourt.Design/methodology/approachExploratory and inferential statistical analysis of data collated from 407 questionnaires was carried out. Using chi-square analysis, significant bivariate associations were sought between the level of uptake of different categories of property level adaptation and the socioeconomic characteristics of households. A two-step cluster analysis was used to explore discernible patterns of households implementing similar adaptation measures. Logistic regression analysis was further used to evaluate the extent to which socioeconomic parameters impact residents' willingness to undertake adaptation measures given the option of relocation.FindingsThe chi-square analysis highlighted a lack of significant association between some socioeconomic parameters and the uptake of individual adaptation measures. The regression analysis however showed that the socioeconomic parameters exert varying degrees of influence on the residents' willingness to undertake adaptation measures. Two homogeneous groups of residents with similar socioeconomic characteristics were identified via the cluster analysis but did not translate into strongly discernible adaptation differences/patterns.Practical implicationsThe study shows that although socioeconomic parameters to some extent underlie the technical dimensions to flood resilience, there is no distinctive typology of households in Port Harcourt adopting a similar combination of measures.Originality/valueThe study offers insights into understanding property-level flood risk adaptation responses within the context of the developing world.
