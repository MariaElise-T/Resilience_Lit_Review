Abstract
There is a lack of literature on the effects of physical activity and depression on resilience in women living with HIV. This cross-sectional study examined the associations of sociodemographic factors, physical activity, and depression on resilience among 97 women living with HIV using linear regression models. Among these women, the mean resilience score was 70.7 (SD 16.3), the majority were insufficiently active (67.0%), and 45.4% had a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score that indicated at least moderate depression. In a multivariable analysis, depression was negatively associated with resilience, and education was positively associated with resilience (p < .0001; p = .031). There was no significant correlation between physical activity and depression or resilience. An exploratory analysis did not indicate that depression mediated the relationship between physical activity and resilience. There is a need to address low levels of physical activity in women living with HIV. Interventions that address resilience and depressive symptoms may lead to improved mental health.
