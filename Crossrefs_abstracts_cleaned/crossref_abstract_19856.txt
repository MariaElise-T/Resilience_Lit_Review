ObjectivesEmpty nesters in China have limited mental health literacy (MHL), which may lead to poorer health outcomes. Studies demonstrate that MHL is associated with both resilience and positive coping style. However, the potential mechanism of MHL, resilience and positive coping style remain unclear. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the possible mediating role of resilience in the relationship between MHL and positive coping style.MethodIn this cross-sectional study, a total of 363 empty nesters from Huzhou, China were surveyed in 2022. The Chinese version of Mental Health Literacy Scale (C-MHLS), the Chinese version of 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ-19) were used to assess MHL, resilience, and positive coping style, respectively.ResultsPositive coping style was significantly correlated with MHL and resilience, and MHL was positively correlated with resilience (p &lt; 0.01). MHL can significantly and positively predict the positive coping style, and resilience played a partial intermediary role between MHL and positive coping style, with the intermediary effect of 77.36%.ConclusionThis study indicates that MHL not only directly affected positive coping style, but also indirectly influences positive coping style by increasing the resilience of empty nesters. The results provide an empirical evidence for the development of intervention programs to improve positive coping style directly and indirectly. Consequently, community health servicers should take targeted measures which focus on MHL and resilience as breakthrough points to stimulate positive coping style of empty nesters, and ultimately achieve their overall well-being.
