AbstractThe increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the retirement of conventional generation units have decreased system inertia, making power systems more vulnerable to resilience and stability issues. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach using grid‐supportive loads (GSLs) to provide a fast and concise primary frequency response and a deep deterministic policy gradient agent‐based secondary controller to restore the system frequency to the nominal value. The proposed method is evaluated on the single‐area and multi‐area test systems. The simulation results demonstrate that using GSLs enhances the power system's stability and resilience. Compared to conventional controllers, the frequency nadir is improved with GSLs. Additionally, the proposed method effectively enhances resilience even with high penetration. These findings indicate that the proposed approach can improve the resilience and stability of power systems and provide a promising solution for future power systems. The results of this study underscore the importance of utilizing innovative approaches to enhance the stability and resilience of power systems in the context of high penetration of renewable energy sources and the retirement of conventional generation.
