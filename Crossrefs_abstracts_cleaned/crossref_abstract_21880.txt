Autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a life-threatening, relapsing disease in which an acquired deficiency of the enzyme ADAMTS13 leads to generalised microvascular thrombosis. Survivors have a high prevalence of depression and impaired cognitive function. The aim of this study was to determine whether life circumstances and personality have an influence on the development and severity of depression and anxiety in iTTP patients and how they impact the quality of life. With validated questionnaires, we examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in 104 iTTP patients, as well as parameters of subjective cognitive deficits, quality of life, attitude to life and resilience. iTTP patients had significantly more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), a tendency to have anxiety disorders (p = 0.035) and a significantly worse cognitive performance (p = 0.008) compared to the controls. Sex, age, physical activity and partnership status had no significant influence on depression, whereas the number of comorbidities did. Lower scores of resilience, attitude to life and quality of life were reported by patients compared to controls. iTTP patients had a high prevalence of depression and anxiety, as well as a more negative attitude to life and low resilience. Resilience correlated negatively with the severity of the depression. Furthermore, quality of life and cognitive performance were significantly reduced.
