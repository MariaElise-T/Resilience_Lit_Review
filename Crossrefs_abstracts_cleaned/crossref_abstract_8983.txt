Abstract
An ability to prepare, recover and adapt to frequent climatic variation is called “Climate resilience.” climate change now places additional pressure on the cattle industry, particularly in developing nations, which threatens the livelihood of small farmers. In 2013 “Food and Agriculture Organization” reported that the livestock sector accounts for nearly one-third of agricultural gross production value globally. There are higher possibilities of the effective implications of sustainable intensification in the livestock production systems to determine production pathways that are more sustainable and productive with a minimum negative impact on the environment. The paper discusses the systematic review mingled with qualitative text analysis to explore the interrelation between sustainable intensification and resilient climate practices, specifically towards the livestock production system. The data for systematic review was taken from Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases from 1995 till 2020, with total screened 94 articles in the final selection. The study’s results revealed that all approaches involving environment-friendly practices with higher production efficiency, resource use efficiency and reachable to every farmer were considered sustainable intensification. The relevance of this sustainability analysis to climate resilience is illustrated by considering different types of livestock systems with concerned practices. So, the inclusion of appropriate technology in an appropriate system will open the door for sustainable intensification in the face of a Climate-Resilient livestock production system and finally lead the farming community towards sustainable development.
