Critical infrastructures provide services that are essential to the functioning and well-being of society. Failure to provide these services is unacceptable. This is a problem when considering the unpredictable nature of the environment (leading to crisis, natural disasters, terrorist attacks) and internal failures. The concern is even greater due to the interconnected and interdependent nature of critical infrastructures, which might lead to failure propagation, causing domino and cascade effects. The resilience of a system is the ability to reduce the magnitude and/or duration of disruptive events or their consequences, allowing a satisfactory level of performance and quality of services. Improving critical infrastructures' resilience before any disruption occurs can reassure society's vital needs. The goal of the paper is to define an improved decision support method for resilience by combining resilience assessment and multi-viewpoint modeling methods.
