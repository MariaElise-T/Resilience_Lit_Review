As being one of the prominent phenomenon in ecology, engineering and pyschology studies for more than thirty years, resilience has started to gain attraction and attention in management and organization fields in the last decade. The concept is accepted as an antidote of invulnerability (Weick, 1993), adaptive functioning against risk hazards (Rutter, 1987) and ability to cope with multiple changes (Boyd and Folke, 2012). Resilience is either defined as set of available and accessible behaviors over time that reflects growth (Ungar; 2010,2011) or as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2007), Â it fosters the strenght and the survival of the organism. Resilience could be accepted in its infancy in management and organization studies, however, it has a grand potential to understand how employees in organizations endure ongoing changes, challenges and uncertainty that reveal through innovation and its potential effects on innovation performance. Due to lack of any measurement scale in employee innovation resilience, in this study,,we aim at proposing a model that presents innovation resilience as a second order multidimensional construct that consists of three dimensions and three sub-dimensions of each observable variables.
