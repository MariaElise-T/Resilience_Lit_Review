Aims: One of the most essential causes of mortality in the world is cardiovascular disease. Biological backgrounds and physical risk factors, types of stress and distress, ineffective interaction strategies, stressful life events, as well as low levels resiliency contribute to the start and severity of the disease are some features of this disease. The present research tends to compare the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Guided Mental Imagery (GSI) on the resiliency in cardiovascular patients referring to cardiac rehabilitation ward through 2018-2019.  Methods & Materials: This study is a quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and follow-up with control group. The research samples were 45 participants selected using available method and completed the Conner-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RIS). Interventions consisted of 8 sessions of 60 minutes each (ACT group) and 10 sessions of 45 minutes each (GSI group). Data analysis was performed using repeated measurement covariance analysis and Bonferroni test in SPSS v. 22 software.  Findings: The research findings showed the effectiveness of the two treatments of ACT and GSI on the increase in resiliency of cardiovascular patients. In other words, the results of Bonferroni test indicate the more effectiveness of ACT than GSI in increasing resiliency is in cardiovascular patients (P<0.005). Therefore, it can be concluded that ACT, by focusing on psychological flexibility, is more effective than GSI on Resilience. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, the ACT with the main acceptance factor, may expand the concept of acceptance by believing in lack of control over life in cardiovascular patients, and increase their resiliency. A one-month follow-up of the results showed its sustainability and strength.
