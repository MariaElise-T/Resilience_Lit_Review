Abstract
The current research uses autoethnography as a method to share my experience as a brain tumor patient. In this piece, I reference poems from the day of my diagnosis through my surgery, recovery, and following treatment to demonstrate the thematic factors that allowed me to cope and experience positive emotions as an oncology patient. Results included the factors of trust in medical care, utilizing social support, finding meaning and purpose, and self-love and gratitude. The implications of these factors in relation to resilience structures and discourses to better serve other oncology and chronic illness patients are discussed.
