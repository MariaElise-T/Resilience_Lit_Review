AbstractBackgroundLittle is known about the ambiguous and complex relationship between frailty, resilience and depression in older adults living with HIV (OALHIV). Thus, the current study aimed to further clarify the relationship, as well as to investigate whether resilience plays a mediating role and to quantify the mediating effect.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on patients who were aged â‰¥50 y with HIV/AIDS at the First Hospital of Changsha City from June to August 2019. The sociodemographic characteristics of participants, depression, resilience and frailty were evaluated by the self-developed questionnaire, the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and Tilburg Frailty Indicator, respectively. SPSS macro model 4 was used to analyse the mediation of resilience between frailty and depression.ResultsA total of 175 OALHIV (120 males and 55 females) were investigated in this study. The prevalence of frailty and depression was 31.4% and 30.9%, respectively. Additionally, the mediation analysis model showed that frailty could contribute to depression directly, and that it also affected depression through resilience, suggesting that resilience partially mediated the relationship between frailty and depression among OALHIV.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that resilience appears to be a protective factor for depression. Effective and targeted intervention on resilience is available and is crucial to improve the life quality of OALHIV.
