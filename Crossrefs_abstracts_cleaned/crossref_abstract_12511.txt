Abstract
The study aimed to determine the study feasibility of a weekly virtual community-based choral singing program and to explore the impact of weekly choral singing on resilience, anxiety, and benefit finding in cancer survivors. Six participants were recruited from the Survivorship Choir (SC), led by a board-certified music therapist and affiliated with a cancer center. Study participants attended their standard 90-minute rehearsals, which were conducted virtually because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Researchers followed participants over eight weeks, collecting data at weeks one and eight. Five self-report instruments were used and included a researcher-designed Demographic Form. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) is a 10-item questionnaire assessing participants’ resilience. The PROMIS: Emotional Distress-Anxiety Scale measured participants’ anxiety levels, and the Carver Benefit Finding Scale assessed participants’ benefit finding levels. The participant Feedback Form, designed by the researchers, assessed the study’s feasibility and effectiveness. High attendance and completion rates demonstrated the study’s feasibility. Choral singing led to a statistically significant increase in resilience (W = 0.00, p = .036, rrb = -1.00) between baseline (M = 28.33, SD = 7.20) and week 8 (M = 33.83, SD = 4.88), demonstrating a large effect. While not significant, anxiety and benefit finding trended in a desirable direction with large effects. The present study format was feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study showed that community-based choral singing, even in a virtual format, may positively affect cancer survivorship by increasing resilience and benefit finding and alleviating anxiety.
