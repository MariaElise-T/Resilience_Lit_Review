ABSTRACT:
One method for developing personal resilience is to listen to the stories of others who developed resilience. This article highlights the elements of spiritual practice, relationships, and education, as experienced by the first American saint, Elizabeth Ann Seton. Seton worked through immense suffering, demonstrating integration, adjustment, and growth. Her life story is an example of resilience as a practice that nurses can learn from today.
