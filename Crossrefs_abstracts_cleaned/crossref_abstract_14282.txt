The present study was applied in terms of purpose, a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up research in terms of method, and a quasi-experimental design in terms of nature.Â  The results showed a difference between the mean scores of resilience, happiness, and hope in the three acceptance and commitment therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and control groups within pre-test, post-test, and follow-up steps. There was a difference between the effects of ACT and CBT on resilience, happiness, and hope of veterans with psychopathy living in Dezful.
