Based on a Citizen Science (CS) project which brings together scholars and Fridays For Future (FFF) activists, the article attempts to understand what effects the Covid-19 pandemic has on the movement in terms of communication, organization and mobilization. The methodological CS rationale is that the activists in their role as citizen scientists are better equipped to address the relevant questions and methods than traditional scholars. The paper presents findings of a national survey designed in cooperation with FFF activists on how the movement responded to the challenges posed by Covid-19. The analysis shows that FFF has been strikingly resilient to the pandemic situation given its digital backbone as an organization. Digital and physical protests were organized and the internal and external communication was kept afloat.
