Unprecedented challenges have been imposed on global markets to minimise losses in the short and long supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to identify the impacts created by the Covid-19 pandemic on the short and long supply chains in Brazil. This paper analyses the short and long supply chains in Brazil, whose overriding data were consulted on the websites of supervisory bodies and agencies at home and abroad. Adopting a qualitative approach, the consultation of literature about short and long supply chains was to determine the impacts of the pandemic on them in Brazil, as well as the resilience adopted by many in the course of the outbreak of the new coronavirus. This study examines the resilience of the Brazilian supply chains when pointing out the impacts on them during the Covid-19 pandemic and the alternatives to continue operating. It was also found that short supply chain resilience plays a key role in the Brazilian food supply. The study is restricted to the context of Brazil and its particularities. Also, further studies are required to explore the economic and operating impacts on different sectors of the economy in the post-pandemic period.
