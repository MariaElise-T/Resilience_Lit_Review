AbstractVehicle registration system is an essential process for recording the transfer of vehicles' ownership. Most of existing systems are administratively centralized, semi‐automated, and rely on a formal proof provision. While these systems were initially proposed to preserve the owner's rights, prove their ownerships and legally record used motor‐land transportation means. Unfortunately, these systems also allow the registration of illegally smuggled and stolen vehicles. This is mainly due to inefficient verification methods, long heterogeneous administrative procedures or to corrupt individuals at the motor registration departments. Regardless of the reasons, the fact that the system allows such cases hints on a faulty design. Current systems are centralized and do not perform a double checking until a report is made, which means that this occurs after the fact of registering the forged vehicle. Noting that these reports are not always fruitful, if the vehicle's proofs were properly injected in the system. This paper proposes a system that is transparent where every vehicle registration is done under everyone's watchful eyes. No denying, no alteration, and no unauthorized injection may occur. The proposed system saves the owner's information and the vehicle's descriptions in transactions saved in a public blockchain where all the history of purchases regarding the subject vehicle may be tracked. The use of blockchain technology is motivated by its security, transparency, and traceability as well as its immutability and scalability in terms of users. We have evaluated our proposed solution in terms of its security and resiliency to the injection of forged transactions by the elaboration of the attack tree. The results show our solution's superiority when compared against current registration system.
