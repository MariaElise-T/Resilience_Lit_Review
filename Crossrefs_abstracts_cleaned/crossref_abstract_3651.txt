SummaryThis paper proposes a methodology for developing earthquake‐resilient structures (ERSs). This is achieved by following principles of full cycle performance control and embracing a holistic approach to design led analysis (DLA) of ERS. Collapse prevention (CP) and postearthquake realignment and repairs (PERRs) are the basic traits of ERS. Despite the availability of several systems involving combinations of gap opening link beams (GOLBs), rigid rocking cores, buckling‐restrained braces, replaceable energy dissipating moment connections, and so forth, neither CP nor PERR are addressed in any code of practice. Although most of these devices have passed several tests of experiments and time–history analysis they have rarely been examined as integral parts of actual buildings. Real buildings cannot be ideally recentered unless specifically designed and detailed for CP and PERR. Almost all simple beam–column joints, especially standard hinged supports absorb small but sufficient amounts of residual strains that hinder PERR. The proposed methodology is introduced by way of developing an earthquake‐resilient rocking core‐moment frame, as the lateral resisting component of a gravity resisting structure that has been detailed not to develop residual effects while sustaining large lateral deformations.
