This review aimed to assess questionnaires or scales used to measure resilience in health care research and outline the domains included in the questionnaires. We used a five-step framework for developing a scoping review by Arksey and O'Malley in 2005. Studies used in this section were obtained from electronic searches conducted on CINAHL and Medline databases. The initial search yielded 4291 articles; 11 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with four questionnaires used to measure resilience. The domains outlined by all questionnaires were overlapping and inconsistent. The most common resilience domains are competence, acceptance and support.
