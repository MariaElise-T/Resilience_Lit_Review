We provide a holistic framework for enhancing geopolitical resilience in IB, comprising four complimentary views (inside-in, inside-out, outside-in, and outside-out) along with actionable insights to key stakeholders (e.g., practitioners) grappling with geopolitics in IB. We recommend to: (i) treat geopolitics as an endogenous and continuous process, (ii) anticipate the effects of larger politico-economic dynamics, (iii) enhance resilience from an outside-out perspective, (iv) pursue multilevel analysis to that effect. Finally, we introduce a novel and more fundamental conceptualization of resilience to those encountered in the literature (e.g., of ‘bouncing back’, ‘above’, or ‘beyond’). Namely, ‘bouncing with’ the waves of contemporary geopolitics.
