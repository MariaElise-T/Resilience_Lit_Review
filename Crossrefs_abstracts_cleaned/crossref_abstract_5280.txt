This study presents a analysis of the impact of climate change on several factors that affect agricultural output such as soil moisture, temperature anomalies, and precipitation anomalies. The project utilizes data-powered positive deviance (DPPD) to identify farmers who are achieving better values of the aforementioned factors despite similar geographical conditions. The findings are then used to devise policies to assist other farmers in adopting similar practices. The methodology used in the study applies seasonal-trend decomposition using the loess (STL) method to analyze temporal trends of weather variables across a specific region, using data collected from various sources, such as satellite imagery and weather station readings in the state of Telangana. Similar studies done across the world demonstrate an improvement in crop yields and an increase in the resilience of farms from rapid climate change.
