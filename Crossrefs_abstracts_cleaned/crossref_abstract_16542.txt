In American metropolitan areas, many elderly people will have limited financial resources, leading to a growing number of seniors who struggle with poverty and financial insecurity. At the same time, federal funding for social services is shrinking, and local organizations will play a key role in supporting the low‚Äêincome elderly in American metropolitan areas. The concept of social resilience offers a useful starting point for understanding the mechanisms that hinder or enable local communities and individuals, in order to recognize and cope with the slow, continuous changes that these demographic shifts present. The objective of the study is to understand how metropolitan areas (by example of Phoenix, AZ) deal with the demographic changes of an aging population and increasing financial insecurity and inequality. The major findings for the research period from 2012 to 2014 show that local actors from the public and nonprofit sectors demonstrated involvement in the network of support for the aging population, where nonprofit actors are mainly dependent on the decisions and funding of the public sector, and increasingly rely on volunteer support.
