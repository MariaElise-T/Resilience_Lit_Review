Teachers’ resilience has a crucial impact in building effective educational practices and developing sustainable learning environments all over the world. Moreover, effective teacher education programs incorporate practices aiming to develop teachers’ resilience. In order to gain this objective, it is important to better understand the mechanisms underlying resilience. In this study, we investigated the relations between fear of negative evaluations, emotion regulation strategies, teaching self-efficacy and resilience on a sample of 1365 Romanian teachers. More, we examined the differences among teachers in terms of age, organizational level, educational cycle on the variables mentioned above. The results of the regressions analysis showed 3 significant predictors of resilience: fear of negative evaluation, emotion self-regulation strategies and teaching self-efficacy. The ANOVA tests also displayed that teaching experience and employment status (tenured/temporary) partially affect teachers’ resilience. Practical implications for teacher education programs are discussed.
