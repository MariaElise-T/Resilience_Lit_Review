AbstractSince the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept the world, many countries face a problem that is a shortage of medical resources. The role of emergency medical facilities in response to the epidemic is beginning to arouse public attention, and the construction of the urban resilient emergency response framework has become the critical way to resist the epidemic. Today, China has controlled the domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases through multiple emergency medical facilities and inclusive patient admission criteria. Most of the existing literature focuses on case studies or characterizations of individual facilities. This paper constructs an evaluation system to measure urban hospital resilience from the spatial perspective and deciphered the layout patterns and regularities of emergency medical facilities in Wuhan, the city most affected by the epidemic in China. Findings indicate that the pattern of one center and two circles are a more compelling layout structure for urban emergency medical facilities in terms of accessibility and service coverage for residents. Meanwhile, the Fangcang shelter hospital has an extraordinary performance in terms of emergency response time, and it is a sustainable facility utilization approach in the post-epidemic era. This study bolsters areas of the research on the urban resilient emergency response framework. Moreover, the paper summarizes new medical facilitiesâ€™ planning and location characteristics and hopes to provide policy-makers and urban planners with valuable empirical evidence.
