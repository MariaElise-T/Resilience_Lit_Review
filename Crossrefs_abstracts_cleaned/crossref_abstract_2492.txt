The purpose of this study is to map the recent scientific literature on resilience and analyses the most substantial contributions to the advancement of studies in the business and management research field. A bibliometric analysis from the Web of Science / Social Sciences Citation Index database – covering the period 2014 until May 2021 – was carried out. Bibliometric techniques and tools were applied, such as co-citation counts and historiography generated by HistCiteTM, and bibliographic coupling and cartography from VOSviewer (visualization of similarities). As result, 637 articles were identified, which were published in 114 journals and written by 1607 authors affiliated to 821 institutions from 63 countries. This study provides new information not previously reviewed, for example, most influential journals and articles in recent years. The analysis allowed elaborating a map that provides clues for future studies on resilience in the business and management research field.
