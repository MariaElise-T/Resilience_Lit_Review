Culture shapes how general principles, rules and knowledge concretise in a specific context. Therefore, broadening the approach to disaster risk management by incorporating cultural variability is a key factor in strengthening resilience in our societies. This article offers a theoretical framework to contextualise the concept of “Safety Culture” in the field of public safety and disaster risk reduction (DRR), with the aim of supporting its understanding and measurement in our communities and finally attaining more disaster-resilient societies. The work discusses the role of cultural dimensions in risk management and DRR. It highlights the relevance of building knowledge and practices based on the consideration of culture and cultural variability in all phases of the risk-management process. After an overview of the safety culture concept, including its origins, developments and applications, the text explores the transferability of this concept to the context of public safety. Then, based on the existing safety culture models, metrics and indicators from other sectors, the paper proposes an original definition of safety culture for the DRR context, shaped by a series of elements and dimensions specifically outlined for this context. Finally, the expected benefits of applying safety culture concepts and techniques for further advances in DRR are discussed.
