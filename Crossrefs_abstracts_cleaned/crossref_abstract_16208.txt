 School in the Park is a museum-based intervention intended to nurture the resilience of inner-city students in third grade to fifth grade. The academic resilience and personal development of participants were compared to those of nonparticipants for 2 years. Although the groups differed in academic resilience for the duration of the study, they did not differ in their positive self-perceptions of three psychosocial variables (character, self-efficacy, and attitude toward school). The only significant difference between groups was in academic self-concept; program participants' and younger nonparticipants' ratings were stable, whereas those of the older nonparticipants declined. All groups' attitudes toward school declined. The independence of these two sets of measures was an unexpected finding, as they have been highly correlated in the majority of previous studies.
