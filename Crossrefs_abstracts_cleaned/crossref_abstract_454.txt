Multi-microgrids have gained interest in academics and industry in recent years. Multi-microgrid (MG) allows the integration of different distributed energy resources (DERs), including intermittent renewables and controllable local generators, and provides a more flexible, reliable, and efficient power grid. This research formulates and proposes a solution for finding optimal location and operation of mobile energy storage (MES) in multi-MG power distribution systems (PDS) with different resources during extreme events to maximize system resiliency. For this purpose, a multi-stage event-based system resiliency index is defined and the impact of the Internet of things (IoT) application in MES operation in multi-MG systems is investigated. Moreover, the demand and price uncertainty impact on multi-MG operational performance indices is presented. This research uses a popular PG & E 69-bus multi-MG power distribution network for simulation and case studies. A new hybrid PSO-TS optimization algorithm is constructed for the simulations to better understand the contributions of MES units and different DERs and IoT on the operational aspects of a multi-MG system. The results obtained from the simulations illustrate that optimal operation of MES and other energy resources, along with the corresponding energy sharing strategies, significantly improves the distribution system operational performance.
