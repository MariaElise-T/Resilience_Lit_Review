This article provides a comprehensive review of power grid resilience, including current metrics and definitions, as well as the procedures used to ensure and improve the resilience of a system. We also describe the different strategies used by users to ensure their own resilience. Additionally, this article highlights areas for future research and opportunities for the integration of emerging technologies such as computer vision. The main objective of this study was to explore the metrics and strategies used in power grids and for the users to improve and ensure resilience in case of events.
