 Issues on competitiveness and sustainability frame the configuration of urbanization in Asia Pacific. The unpredictability and intermittency of extreme climate and weather events exacerbate the economic, societal and environmental sustainability of urban habitats. This exigency configures this article on the need to review the climate-proof finance for disaster-resilient infrastructure. Climate-change-triggered migration is rapidly growing, particularly in Asia. This article uses the complexity and sustainability viable systems model (VSM) to gauge the multiplicity of parameters on vulnerability of disaster-prone infrastructure. The assurance on sustainability while maintaining competitiveness is corroborated with the tenets of VSM utilizing the top-downâ€“bottom-up alignment of disaster-proof financing. Outcomes of this article articulate the equilibrium between competitiveness and sustainability, as economic considerations outweigh the need for disaster-proof financing of infrastructure.
