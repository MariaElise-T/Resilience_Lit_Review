Climate change has become a global phenomenon and has become the focus of world attention. The resilience of fishermen in facing climate change shows the ability of fishermen to respond, organize, learn and adapt in the face of climate change. The purpose of this study is to analyze the livelihood resilience of small fishermen in the face of climate change based on three main indicators, namely buffer capacity, self-organization, and learning capacity. A total of 300 fishermen were selected using quota sampling and interviewed through a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the descriptive and livelihood resilience index to explain the fishermen's resilience. The findings indicate that most fishermen in the coastal area of Bengkulu have a low level of livelihood resilience. The dimension of fisherman's learning capacity needs to be improved to strengthen livelihood resilience. Ecological, social, and economic adjustments to the capture fisheries business system in response to climate change can help fishermen in increasing their adaptive capacity and livelihood resilience is highly dependent on the ability and experience of fishermen in adapting.
