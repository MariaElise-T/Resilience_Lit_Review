Aims:The United Kingdom Resilience Programme (UKRP) is a secondary school initiative which aims to help 11- to 13-year-olds develop skills that allow them to be more resilient in dealing with situations both in and out of school. An evaluative study of the UKRP sponsored by the Department for Education (DfE) was completed in 2011. However, this study did not include the voice of parents or carers. Previous research and Government initiatives have stressed the importance of the parental figure in the development of children’s happiness and well-being. The current study elicited the perceptions of parents relating to the school-based UKRP.Method:This qualitative research study applied an in-depth Grounded Theory analysis to interview data collected from a sample of eight parents whose child had been taught the UKRP.Findings:Through a process of data coding plus accompanying memos and diagrams, the analysis identifies six key processes that contributed to parental perceptions of the UKRP: choice; communication; understanding; experience; value; and relationships.Conclusions:The study concludes by linking the six key identified processes in putting forward ‘empowerment’ as a plausible mechanism for effective parental engagement. The study supports and expands upon earlier studies which highlight the importance of meaningful parent-school partnerships, and offers new evidence to inform home-school policies and effective working practices with parents. These findings are particularly pertinent to educational professionals in the current climate in light of impending changes to Special Educational Needs policy, and the advent of new and diverse schooling opportunities and challenges. Implications for the role of the educational psychologist are also discussed.
