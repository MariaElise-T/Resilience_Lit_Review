Sustainability and resilience are the two main paradigms of planning and
   policy making in the past decades. Fostering resilience in the face of
   environmental, socio-economic and political uncertainty and risk has
   captured the attention of academics and decision makers across disciplines,
   sectors and spatial scales. Urban resilience has become an important goal
   for cities, especially from the point of view of adapting to climate change
   and reducing their ecological footprint. Urban resilience is conventionally
   defined as the measurable ability of any urban system, with its inhabitants,
   to maintain continuity through all shocks and stresses while positively
   adapting and transforming towards sustainability. However, in theory and
   practice there are different definitions that are often in conflict. This
   paper first provides an overview of existing definitions of urban resilience
   and highlights their main determinants. Then, the paper discusses
   definitions from the perspective of ways of incorporating key concepts found
   both in resilience theory and urban theory. In the following, similarities
   and mutual tensions are recognized between the key concepts. Finally, the
   paper concludes that a clearer conceptualization is needed to improve this
   developing field and create conditions for its further operationalization.
