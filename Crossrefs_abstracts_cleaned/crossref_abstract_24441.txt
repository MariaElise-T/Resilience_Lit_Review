ABSTRACT
Depressive disorders are partly caused by chronic inflammation through the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Preventive intervention using anti-inflammatory reagents may be beneficial for alleviating the risk of depression. In this study, we focused on the Japanese local citrus plant, Citrus tumida hort. ex Tanaka (C. tumida; CT), which contains flavonoids such as hesperidin that have anti-inflammatory actions. The dietary intake of 5% immature peels of CT fruits slightly increased stress resilience in a subchronic and mild social defeat (sCSDS) model in mice. Moreover, the dietary intake of 0.1% hesperidin significantly increased stress resilience and suppressed KYN levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in these mice. In addition, KYN levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly correlated with the susceptibility to stress. In conclusion, these results suggest that dietary hesperidin increases stress resilience by suppressing the augmentation of KYN signaling under sCSDS.
