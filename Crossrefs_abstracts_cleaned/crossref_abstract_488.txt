Many researchers have focused on documenting the consequences of&nbsp;campus sexual assault (CSA), but there is a dearth of research on students’ post-assault&nbsp;lived&nbsp;experiences.&nbsp;Specifically, there is a lack of scholarship exploring&nbsp;how student victim-survivors of CSA&nbsp;may&nbsp;view, understand, resist, or experience&nbsp;resilience as&nbsp;they&nbsp;navigate post-assault life on campus.&nbsp;The purpose of this paper is to explore the question, “How is resilience described and defined in the literature of CSA?” To respond to this question, I explore other related but distinct concepts that appear in the literature around resilience, including&nbsp;posttraumatic growth,&nbsp;meaning-making, and recovery. Although the focus is on CSA literature, I include&nbsp;scholarship&nbsp;broadly related to trauma,&nbsp;given the limited research specific to resilience and CSA.&nbsp;As a social work scholar and practitioner, I also introduce the significance of this topic within the social work field.&nbsp;Finally, I briefly introduce two theoretical perspectives that have informed and guided the conceptualization of this paper, including socio-ecological and intersectional feminist theoretical perspectives.&nbsp;This&nbsp;conceptual paper&nbsp;was a result of preparation for&nbsp;a qualitative&nbsp;inquiry&nbsp;using phenomenology&nbsp;that aimed to explore the phenomenon of resilience among undergraduate students who had experienced CSA.&nbsp;Suggestions for future work are included.
