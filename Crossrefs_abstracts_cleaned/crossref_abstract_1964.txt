Climate change is undoubtedly a big issue due to its devastating consequences. The enhanced resilience to natural hazards due to climate change belongs to the concept of smart cities.

These apps are available through the Internet or mobile devices and can be used to inform and train the stakeholders of disaster-prone areas in order to mitigate the impacts of disasters.
