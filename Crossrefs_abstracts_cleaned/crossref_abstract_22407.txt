Networked nonlinear systems (NNSs) have great potential security threats because of malicious attacks. These attacks will destabilize the networked systems and disrupt the communication to the networked systems, which will affect the stability and performance of the networked control systems. Therefore, this paper aims to deal with the resilient control problem for NNSs with dynamically triggering mechanisms (DTMs) and malicious aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To mitigate the impact from DoS attacks and economize communication resources, a resilient dynamically triggering controller (RDTC) is designed with DTMs evolving an adaptive adjustment auxiliary variable. Thus, the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable by employing the piecewise Lyapunov function technique. In addition, according to the minimum inter-event time, the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Finally, the merits of the proposed controllers and theory are corroborated using the well-known nonlinear Chua circuit.
