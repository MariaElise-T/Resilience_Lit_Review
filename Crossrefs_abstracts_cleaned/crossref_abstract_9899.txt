AbstractIntroductionResilience can be difficult to conceptualise and little is known about resilience in medical doctors.AimsThis systematic review discusses the existing literature on influences on resilience levels of medical doctors.MethodsThe bibliographic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from 2008 to November 2018 using keyword search terms resilience* AND (“medical physician*” OR doctor* OR surgeon* OR medical trainee* or clinician*).ResultsTwenty-four studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. A narrative synthesis was performed. The following influences on resilience in doctors were identified: demographics, personality factors, organisational or environmental factors, social support, leisure activities, overcoming previous adversity and interventions to improve resilience.ConclusionsResilience is not limited to a doctor’s own personal resource. Published studies also highlight the influence of other modifiable factors.
