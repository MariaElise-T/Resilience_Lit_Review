Abstract
Responding to the impact, community and individuals during a crisis is demanding for humanitarian workers. The need for resilience is crucial for the delivery of effective humanitarian aid and staff long-term emotional endurance. This article describes an arts-based approach aimed at enhancing the resilience of 53 World Vision (WV) staff in Asia at a weeklong Regional Disaster Management Team (RDMT) workshop. The purpose was to introduce responders to embodied artful experiences to develop coping skills and enhance their personal resilience to the impact of the response before, during and after deployment. The arts-based experiential sessions were embraced by the participants, with many acknowledging that they will engage in the arts as a reflexive practice during deployment.
