Abstract
We investigate the suitable model to carry out environmental engineering primarily in aspects of social resilience and tourism in Plajan Village Jepara Central Java. Using a mixed method, this study shows that social and tourism resilience can be developed by involving stakeholders in the village consisting of communities, entrepreneurs and local governments, as well as academic groups; these forces are communities that work together synergistically and coordinative. “The necessary conditions” for local environmental engineering towards social and tourism resilience in a sustainable manner is the need for village infrastructure, especially for tourist sites or spots that are still lacking in information. This infrastructure can be divided into two things: “gray infrastructure” and “blue infrastructure”. Gray infrastructure is public infrastructure that can disrupt community activities and tourism, such as roads, bridges, social infrastructure, while Blue infrastructure is directly related to local environments such as protected forests and water resources.
