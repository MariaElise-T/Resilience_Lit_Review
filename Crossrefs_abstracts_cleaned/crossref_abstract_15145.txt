 There are many regions worldwide which are susceptible to landslides, which cause loss of life and adverse impacts to infrastructure, environment and communities. Landslides are often triggered by exceptional rainfall and large-magnitude earthquakes. A range of strategies and methods have been developed to mitigate the occurrence of landslides and to reduce their impact, including risk to human safety. The adopted approaches and systems must be sustainable and resilient in relation to the communities that are at risk. This paper refers to an Australian regional case study of urban landslide management in the Wollongong region, New South Wales. The research carried out by the authors over two decades at the University of Wollongong has enhanced the resilience and sustainability of landslide management in the region. Reference is also made to Hong Kong as a case study of urban regional landslide practice, with particular reference to the upgrading of man-made slopes.
