To date, the spring stiffness of resilience pads was mostly evaluated based on conventional (site measurement and laboratory tests) methods. Most studies in the past analyzed the effects of the deterioration of resilience pads on track damage. To examine the deterioration of resilience pads, evaluations were conducted based on laboratory tests using site measurements and samples were collected from the site, or based on loading tests using special equipment. such as TSS. However, no methodology was proposed to prove the theoretical equations of Zimmermann which compute the reaction force at the rail support point. Hence, this study aimed to prove that the reaction force increased if spring stiffness at the rail support point increased; this was achieved by using a pressure sensor according to the theoretical equations of Zimmermann. Furthermore, we aimed to propose a method to evaluate the spring stiffness of resilience pads to predict the extent of deterioration of the pads based on the increase in the pressure measured by a pressure sensor.
