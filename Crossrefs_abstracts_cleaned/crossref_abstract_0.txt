 Since the 1970s, a proliferation of research and concept analysis of resiliency/e has attempted to clarify whether it is a trait or a state. Based on this dualistic approach, studies have either operationalized “resiliency” as a personality trait or “resilience” as a dynamic state. The present review of the concept argues that the trait-state dualism is likely to be a conceptual fallacy, one fundamental reason for the lack of consensus. To facilitate and build consensus, the present conceptual review calls for a transactional approach instead of the dualistic approach to the definition.
