Abstract

Background
Individuals affected by Hansen's disease (leprosy) often experience stigma and discrimination. Greater psychosocial resilience may enable people to deal with such discrimination. This study aimed to explore sources of strength and resilience for individuals affected by Hansen's disease in Brazil.


Methods
We used a cross-sectional study design with a qualitative approach. Semistructured focus groups were conducted. Analysis comprised thematic categorisation of transcripts.


Results
Thirty-one participants were included: 23 individuals affected by Hansen's disease and 8 healthcare providers. We found that while a few individuals affected were provided with formal psychological support in the early phases of their treatment, many noted the importance of providing such support at this time. Most participants described relationships with and social support from family members, friends and with others affected by Hansen's disease as their primary source of resilience. A key context for building resilience was through the peer-level sharing and engagement experienced in self-care and support groups. Participants also emphasised the importance of providing appropriate information about Hansen's disease and the importance of beliefs and spirituality.


Conclusions
Hansen's disease services should seek to build resilience in early treatment through counselling and during treatment and beyond by having people affected getting together. Across both settings supporting family and social relationships, providing accurate information and acknowledging spiritual beliefs are important.
