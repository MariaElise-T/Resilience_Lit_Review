BackgroundStudies elsewhere show that benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) have protective mental health value. However, this protective value has never been investigated in an African context. Given the need to better understand what might support mental health resilience among African young people, this study explores the relationship between BCEs and depressive symptoms among a South African sample of young adults living in a community dependent on the economically volatile oil and gas industry.MethodsA sample of young adults in an oil and gas community in South Africa (N = 313, mean age 20.3 years, SD = 1.83, range from 18 to 26; majority Black African) completed self-report questionnaires to assess BCEs and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II). The analysis controlled for socio-demographics and experience of family adversity. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the association of BCEs with depressive symptoms using STATA 17.ResultsThe majority (86.4% of the sample) reported all 10 BCEs. Of the 10 BCEs, having at least one good friend was the most reported (94%) compared to 75% of the sample reporting having a predictable home routine, such as regular meals and a regular bedtime. The unadjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that having at least one good friend, comforting beliefs, and being comfortable with self were associated with lower odds of moderate depression. The adjusted results showed no association between BCEs and the depression of young adults in this sample.ConclusionIn this South African sample, our results do not show protective associations between BCEs and depression. This could be as a result of the homogeneity in our sample. It is also possible that the BCEs explored could not counteract the effect of chronic risk factors in the lives of the young people in this study context. Further research is needed to understand this complexity.
