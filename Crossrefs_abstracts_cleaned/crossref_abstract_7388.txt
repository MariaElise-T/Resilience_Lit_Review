Women become weak and hopeless when suffering as a victim of Intimate Partner Violence. They experience multiple adversities and conduct searches and struggles to be able to survive and escape from these adversities. Previous research has focused more on efforts to find things that involve domestic violence; however, this research focuses more on finding solutions for women as victims of Intimate Partner Violence. Research has been conducted with qualitative methods that aim to explore the dynamic of resilience on a woman who survives from Intimate Partner Violence. Research’s questions are being compiled based on the understandings about the personal construct and the process of resilience that involved the violence she suffered, thinking style, seven factors of abilities on resiliency, social support, and how the participant’s current life is decided as the main theme of the research (Theme Category) which will be divided into several detailed themes. General results of the research are as follows: (1) Participants experience three types of violence (2) Victims' rejection of violence based on their thinking style which means violence should not be tolerated. (3) Social support greatly influences the victim's ability to survive (4) Initially, participants did not get adequate social support which caused the victim's inability to rise again. When participants begin to receive social support, they continue to try to get out of violence. (5) Several active strategies to control or stop violence can be found in the results of the analysis of research data. (6) Inner strength comes from the behavior of faith in God and identity as a mother. (7) Positive results obtained in this life. Ultimately, these themes will contribute to the resilience model of Intimate Partner Violence. Research conclusions will be discussed based on relevant theory.
