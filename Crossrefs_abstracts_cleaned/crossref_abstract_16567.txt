AbstractAimThe effects of resilience factors on associations between emotional symptoms and perceived pubertal timing or body mass in adolescence are unknown, and this study examined the moderating effects of social competence, family cohesion and loneliness.MethodsData were drawn from the Young‐HUNT 3 study, including a self‐report questionnaire and clinical measurements of weight and height from 7639 adolescents aged 13–18 years. Emotional symptoms were assessed by a five‐item version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Associations between pubertal timing or body mass and emotional symptoms were assessed by linear regression models. Interactions with social competence, family cohesion and loneliness were explored.ResultsA U‐shaped relationship was found for both perceived pubertal timing and for perceived body mass and emotional symptoms. For girls, early perceived pubertal timing was more strongly associated with emotional symptoms among those who often felt lonely. For boys, late perceived pubertal timing and feeling they were fat were more strongly associated with emotional symptoms in those with low scores for social competence or family cohesion.ConclusionEmotional symptoms were more strongly associated with perceived pubertal timing and body mass than actual measures and the associations were stronger for adolescents with low scores for resilience factors.
