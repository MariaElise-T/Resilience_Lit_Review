AbstractObjectiveBe Resilient to Breast Cancer (BRBC), a theoretically‐derived, resilience‐based, culturally‐tailored, supportive‐expressive group therapy (SEGT), has been developed to help promote patients' resilience in breast cancer. Data from patients receiving BRBC intervention was utilized to explore and define characteristics of resilience patterns and their transitions over time.MethodsResilience was used as a primary outcome and 391 patients completed Resilience Scale Specific to Cancer at enrollment (T0), 2 months (T1), 6 months(T2), and 12 months (T3) after intervention. latent profile transition analysis was performed to model the change in resilience and predict positive transitioning probabilities between resilience patterns (from one pattern to another pattern with a higher level) over time.ResultsOne hundred and forty four resilience patterns were identified after BRBC intervention. 33.1%, 50.3%, and 40.5% of patients experienced positive resilience transitions from T0 to T1, T1 to T2, and T2 to T3, respectively. Patients with middle age, unmarried status, higher education level, and less advanced tumor stage were more likely to experience positive resilience transitions.ConclusionDifferent transitions of resilience patterns are observed after BRBC intervention. Age, marital status, education, and tumor stage may be four factors affecting the efficacy of SEGT intervention in breast cancer.
