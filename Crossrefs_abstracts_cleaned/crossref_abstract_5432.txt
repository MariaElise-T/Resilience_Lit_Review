In the context of energy transformation, new energy technologies are developing rapidly, the penetration rate of new energy is increasing, and the energy structure tends to be low-carbon, which leads to the asymmetry between traditional energy and new energy. At present, the smart power grid can be conceived as a complex cyber-physical system, and its resilience assessment in the face of extreme disasters needs more holistic consideration. Therefore, considering the impact of massive access to new energy on the resilience of the power grid main network, the resilience evaluation index system of the power grid main network under the background of the energy transition is established. It is proposed to use the priority comparison method and CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) to determine the subjective weight and subjective and objective weight of the index, respectively, and combine the influence of the two weights to obtain the comprehensive weight. Then, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is used to evaluate the regional power grid restoring force. The results of an example show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the resilience level of the power grid under the background of the energy transition, which has a certain guiding significance for improving the power gridâ€™s resilience under the environment of energy transformation.
