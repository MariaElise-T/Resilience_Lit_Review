Early in the design process, informed decisions must be made to ensure that the developed system will be resilient—that is, capable of preventing, mitigating, or recovering failures. However, at this phase of design, many options exist to achieve resilience, each with different effects on the system’s fault response, performance, and difficulty to implement. As a result, it is important to be able to quantify the value of a design’s resilience so that it can be traded off against these other concerns. Advancements in the capabilities of Prognostics and Health Management, fault-tolerant control and related technologies have enabled a variety of novel prevention and recovery features that require an understanding of the system’s structure and available functions during operation to consider properly. This work aims to develop modelling and design frameworks enabling the consideration of these features, such as system reconfiguration, functional redundancy, operational failure avoidance, and goal change early in the design process. Such design frameworks will show which designed features are most appropriate in the system and will account for the uncertainty of assumptions made in early design phase.
