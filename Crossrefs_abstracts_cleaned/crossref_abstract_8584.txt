Flooding in the Philippines occurs annually in many areas and in varying frequencies and magnitude. Located along the cyclone path, the country suffers from floods and other water induced disasters. In late September and early October 2009, Tropical Storm Ketsana ("Ondoy") and Typhoon Parma ("Pepeng") hit the country in succession and inflicted extensive casualties and physical damage to the country. Tropical Storm Washi ("Sendong") in December 201'1 severely devastated Cagayan de Oro City in Southern Philippines, wiping houses and claiming lives on the island formations in the river area. Again, in December 2012 the city was hit by Typhoon Bopha along with other provinces in Mindanao Island.  The country suffered severe devastation from super typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Typhoon Yolanda), which wreaked havoc in the Visayas and South Luzon regions on November 8, 2013. The extreme event turned out to be one of the strongest storms to make landfall in history.  The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), at the forefront of mitigating the impacts of water related hazards through the provision of structural measures, is constantly challenged to provide efficient and innovative technologies to address current and emerging risks. This paper describes the country's integrated flood risk management approaches and DPWH's thrusts, programs, policies and strategies towards the establishment of resilient communities.
