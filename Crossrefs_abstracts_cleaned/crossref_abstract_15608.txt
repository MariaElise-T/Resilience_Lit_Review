AbstractAimTo examine the resilience of breast cancer patients by investigating the validity and reliability of a Korean version of the breast cancer survivors resilience scale (BCRS) and to provide basic data for developing interventions that can be used by healthcare professionals to enhance the resilience of breast cancer patients.MethodsData were obtained from 280 breast cancer survivors receiving treatment at the outpatient clinic of Kosin University Hospital located in Busan City, Korea, and the collected data were used to confirm content validity, construct validity, criterion validity, and internal consistency reliability.ResultsThe Korean version of the BCRS comprised two subdomains and a total of 16 items, and the internal consistency reliability estimated by Cronbach ºs alpha was .87~.89.ConclusionThis study found that the Korean version BCRS has high validity and reliability. In future studies, it will be necessary to conduct research that identifies the resilience levels of patients with breast cancer, using the Korean version BCRS, and seeks interventions in agreement with the results.
