AbstractObjectiveThe psychological resilience of postoperative non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is influenced by many factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of psychological resilience and identify its influencing factors in postoperative NSCLC patients.MethodsThis descriptive cross‐sectional study used a convenience sampling method and recruited 382 inpatients from two Class A hospitals in Hunan, China. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (CD‐RISC), Strategies Used by People to Promote Health (SUPHH), Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were used.ResultsPostoperative NSCLC patients' psychological resilience was at a low level, with a score of (57.18 ± 8.55). Stepped Linear Regression showed that the related influencing factors of psychological resilience of postoperative NSCLC patients were age (β = −0.313, P < .001), family average income (β = 0.143, P < .001), self‐efficacy (β = 0.416, P < .001), confrontation (β = 0.116, P < .001) and acceptance‐resignation (β = −0.155, P < .001), which could explain 58.0% of the total variation in psychological resilience (F = 103.68, P<.001).ConclusionsPsychological resilience is positively predicted by average income, self‐efficacy, confrontation, but negatively predicted by age and acceptance‐resignation. Self‐efficacy is the most important variable influencing psychological resilience in postoperative NSCLC patients. In the future, a series of targeted interventions need to be implemented to strengthen patients' self‐efficacy and psychological resilience, which can also improve the quality of life of postoperative NSCLC patients.
