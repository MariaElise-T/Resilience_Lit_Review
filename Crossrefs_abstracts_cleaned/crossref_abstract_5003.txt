Purpose: The article conducts the study that the northern coast of Central Java province in Indonesia is considered as the critical area of flood path. The region always suffers from floods due to the heavy rain and/or the sea-level rise. Therefore, people are suffering and the ecosystem is deteriorating.
Methodology: Vulnerability and resilience are considered based on the use of indicators. An indicator or a set of indicators can be deÔ¨Åned as an inherent characteristic that quantitatively estimates the conditions of a system. They usually focus on minor, feasible, palpable and effective part of a system offering people a sense of bigger representation. Therefore, it is very important to know effects on people, cities and natural resources by these indicators.
Result: Results of the present study indicated that levels of vulnerability and the community resilience of the northern coast of Central Java to flood were in the medium category. In addition, the level of coastal community resilience was affected by the exposure of flood risk programs and the public adaptive capacity variable.
Applications: This research can be used for universities, teachers, and students.
Novelty/Originality: A number of efforts have been made to manage and mitigate the flood problems, despite the fact that results are incomplete and still restructuring from time to time. It is realized that infrastructural capacity for flood control, community awareness, and other multi-factors significantly contribute to solving the flood problem in the regions.
