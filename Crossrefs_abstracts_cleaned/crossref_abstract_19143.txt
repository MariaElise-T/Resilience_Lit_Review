Introduction
A natural disaster like flooding causes loss of properties and evacuation and effective mental health. Resilience after natural disasters is a crucial area of research which needs attention.ObjectivesTo explore the prevalence and associated factors of low resilience a year after the 2020 floods in Fort McMurray.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Fort McMurray using online surveys. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 25 using univariate analysis with the chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis.Results
The prevalence of low resilience was 37.4%. Respondents under 25 years were nearly 26 times more likely to show low resilience (OR= 0.038; 95% CI 0.004 - 0.384). Responders with a history of depression and anxiety (OR= 0.212; CI 95% 0.068-0.661) were nearly four to five times more likely to show low resilience. Similarly, respondents willing to receive mental health counselling (OR=0.134 95%CI: 0.047-0.378) were 7.5 times more likely to show low resilience. Participants residing in the same house before the flood were almost 11 times more likely to show low resilience (OR=0.095; 95% CI 0.021- 0.427), and support from the Government of Alberta was a protective factor.ConclusionsThe study showed demographic, clinical, and flood-related variables contributing to low resilience. Receiving support from the Government was shown to be a protective factor against low resilience. More robust measures must be in place to promote normal to high resilience among flood victims in affected communities.Disclosure of InterestNone Declared
