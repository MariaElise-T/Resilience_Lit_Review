Objective: To identify the success and resilience factors of rural enterprises in Mexico in order to contribute to the theoretical and empirical differentiation of these concepts.
Design/Methodology/Approach: We used the National Network for Sustainable Rural Development Companies as a case study to formulate key questions to identify their success and business resilience factors.
Results: Permanent job creation turned out to be the main success factor, and timely delivery of the product was the main resilience factor.
Study Limitations/Implications: Recognizing the difference between success and resilience factors can help rural enterprises, their leaders, and decision-makers in the rural sector to understand and adjust their operating strategies based on their objectives.
Findings/Conclusions: A success factor is a way to stand out among similar rural enterprises, while a business resilience factor serves to face adversity and continue over time.
