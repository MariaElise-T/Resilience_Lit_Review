This study determined the effects of mother-child mediated learning (MCML) strategies on the psychological resilience (PR) and cognitive modifiability (CM) of children with learning disabilities (LD) using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The study utilized a sample of 60 mothers and 60 children with LD. These children were both male (63%) and female (37%) primary five level children diagnosed with LD and were sampled from inclusive primary schools in Enugu State, Nigeria. The mean age and standard deviation of the children was 10.5 Â± 1.04 years. Data collected were analyzed using a SEM approach. The findings of the study showed that (a) the causal model for the explanation of the effects of MCML on the PR and CM of pupils with LD significantly fitted in the observed causal model and (b) MCML had a significant effect on the PR as well as CM of children with LD. One implication of this study is that the PR, as well as the CM of children with LD, can be enhanced through MCML.
