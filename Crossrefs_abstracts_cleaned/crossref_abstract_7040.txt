AbstractWe are currently dealing with disruptions in supply chains. They come from faulty production systems, in poor organization of distribution processes or are related to external factors, often unseen. Consequently, it is necessary to build resistant chains. This article discusses this topic in the context of the basic types of supply chains, i.e. agile, lean and green. The aim of the study was to assess the types of chains in which the tested production entities are embedded and check if the proposed models of building resilience take this into account. The reason this should be investigated further, is to indicate relationships in areas that are rarely captured in research models. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the work. Interviews were conducted in over seventy subjects and a critical analysis of the literature on model of resilient supply chains was performed. As a result of the work undertaken, it can be concluded, inter alia, that in the economic reality, there are hybrid chains in which the characteristics of pro-saving chains prevail. It was also established that the proposed research models for resilient chains should take into account, to greater extent, accents compatible with the nature of the chains occurring an economic reality. It is also necessary to extend their content to include pro-environmental components. At the same time, it is not unequivocal that the chains with the advantage of agility-related attributes are more resistant than the chains in which the greater concentration is attributed to the attributes of lean or green chains. Determining this requires further research.
