AbstractThe genusPseudogymnoascusencompasses soil psychrophilic fungi living also in caves. Some are opportunistic pathogens; nevertheless, they do not cause outbreaks.Pseudogymnoascus destructansis the causative agent of the white-nose syndrome, which is decimating cave-hibernating bats. We used comparative eco-physiology to contrast the enzymatic potential and conidial resilience ofP. destructanswith that of phylogenetically diverse cave fungi, includingPseudogymnoascusspp., dermatophytes and outdoor saprotrophs. Enzymatic potential was assessed by Biolog MicroArray and by growth on labelled substrates and conidial viability was detected by flow cytometry.Pseudogymnoascusdestructanswas specific by extensive losses of metabolic variability and by ability of lipid degradation. We suppose that lipases are important enzymes allowing fungal hyphae to digest and invade the skin.Pseudogymnoascus destructansprefers nitrogenous substrates occurring in bat skin and lipids. Additionally,P. destructansalkalizes growth medium, which points to another possible virulence mechanism. Temperature above 30 °C substantially decreases conidial viability of cave fungi includingP. destructans.Nevertheless, survival ofP. destructansconidia prolongs by the temperature regime simulating beginning of the flight season,what suggests that conidia could persist on the body surface of bats and contribute to disease spreading during bats active season.
