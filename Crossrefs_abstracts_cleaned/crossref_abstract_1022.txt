The Resilience Doughnut is an ecological and Solution-Focused model outlining the seven contexts where resilience skills can be developed. The premise of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the online resilience doughnut measurement tool. The analysis contains item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Each context was explored as a separate subtest. The results showed the model to be a good fit with Cronbach alpha coefficient between .63 and .87. Cor­ relations were conducted with the subscales of the Strength and Difficulties (SDQ) questionnaire and The Resilience scale for Adolescents (READ) revealing that the stronger the resources (RD) the greater the levels of personal and social compe­ tence and the lower the emotional and behavioural difficulties experienced. Im­ plications for further study are discussed noting the validity of enhancing existing strong social resources to develop resilience.
