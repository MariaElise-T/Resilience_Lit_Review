AbstractIn recent years, 5G resilient networks have gained significant attention in the wireless industry. The prime concern of commercial networks is to maximize network capacity to increase their revenue. However, in disaster situations during outages when cell sites are down, instead of capacity, coverage becomes predominant. In this paper, we propose a game theory–based optimal resource allocation scheme, while aiming to maximize the sum rate and coverage probability for the uplink transmissions in disaster situations. The proposed hierarchical game theoretical framework optimizes the uplink performance in multitier heterogeneous network with pico base stations and femto access points overlaid under a macro base station. The test simulations are based on a real‐time data set obtained for a predefined amount of time. The data statistics are then manipulated to create practical disaster situations. The solution for the noncooperative game has been obtained by using pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We perform simulations with different failure rates and the results show that the proposed scheme improves the sum rate and outage probability by significant margin with or without disaster scenario.
