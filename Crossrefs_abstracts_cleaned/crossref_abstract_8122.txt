PurposeThis research study aims to investigate supplier integration's (SI) impact on supply-side resilience (SSR) while considering the intervening role of supplier sustainability and supplier flexibility (SF).Design/methodology/approachGrounded in the dynamic capabilities view (DCV), the study posits that integration of the focal firm with firm's suppliers leads to sustainability on the supplier's side, which makes the firms more flexible to work with during disruptive circumstances, resulting in resilience on the supply side. The hypotheses are tested on the data of 181 manufacturing firm supply chain managers from a developing country.FindingsThe research findings confirmed the hypothesized model suggesting that SI positively impacts SSR. The results also confirm the existence of sequential mediation of supplier sustainability and SF between the SIâ€“SSR relationship.Practical implicationsThe results of this study show that SI is the primary capability for organizations seeking SSR. Furthermore, the supply-side capabilities, to be effective, are developed in a specific order.Originality/valueThis research advances the body of knowledge by identifying the underlying mechanisms through which SI augments SSR.
