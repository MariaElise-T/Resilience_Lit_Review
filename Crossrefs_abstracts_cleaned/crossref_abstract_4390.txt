ABSTRACT
Todayâ€™s healthcare environment is predictably unpredictable and increasingly complex, thus challenging the intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual limits in all of us, and resulting in real consequences such as provider turnover, burnout, shortages, and poor patient health outcomes. Strengthening our resilience results in part from reclaiming hold on our most powerful gift, the ability to choose how we see things. Identifying and shifting our mindset, and especially to an outward mindset in which we clearly see and connect with others around us, will restore the healing in healthcare.
