Abstract
In order to solve the problem of increasing vulnerability and decreasing stability of power system under energy transformation, the resilience indexes that should be considered are summarized and an evaluation algorithm of elastic power system is proposed. Firstly, the overall idea and framework of elastic power system evaluation under energy transformation are given; secondly, the evaluation indexes of elastic power system are studied from three aspects: power supply side, transmission network side and distribution side; finally, based on proposed elastic indexes and PSD-BPA power flow and transient program, the algorithm of resilience power system evaluation is proposed. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by IEEE RTS39 system, reasonable suggestions for resilience grid are also given.
