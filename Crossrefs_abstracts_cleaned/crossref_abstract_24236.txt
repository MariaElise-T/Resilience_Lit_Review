The article raises problems of designing a theoretical foundation to assess the resilience of socio-economic systems that influence regional development. The authors propose an approach to measuring the state of regional socio-economic systems based on the adaptation of the principles of managing the critical infrastructures resilience. It is proposed to use a multidimensional data cube as a basic structure for assessing resilience. The principle of construction of data cube is also given in the article. The authors describe a general algorithm for measuring the resilience of socio-economic systems, indicating the specific features of the implementation of its individual stages. As an example of the efficiency of the proposed approach, the process of measuring the resilience of a higher education institution is considered.
