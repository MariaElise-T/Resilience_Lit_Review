The paper presents Axis Strutture, patented by the authors, awarded with V:alere funds (VAnvitelli pER la ricErca 2020) for the establishment of an innovative start-up, now academic spin-off. It is based on the assemble of iron and wood with 'pins' (in Latin 'axis') threaded to ensure an economic profit in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, reviewing ancient technologies in the light of advanced research. The focus is on the structural connections of a construction system that clamps the steel frame elements with the wooden infill, allowing to assemble modular, prefabricated and flexible components customized on the design phaseâ€™s request. It provides effective emergency shelters assembled or dismantled as quickly as tents but more stable, healthier and comfortable. With a single star key, the steel uprights can be attested with wooden and similar tampons avoiding nails and screws which allows the total reuse of the components. The patented connections implement a new construction method promoting the self-construction of garden houses, leisure environments, bungalows, garages and quality housing modules, since they are resilient, resistant and with a controllable impact on the environment. The case study provides an opportunity to verify actions aimed at the implementation of Design for Adaptability strategies promoting virtuous life cycles that involves the entire community in sustainable models from an economic, environmental and social point of view.
