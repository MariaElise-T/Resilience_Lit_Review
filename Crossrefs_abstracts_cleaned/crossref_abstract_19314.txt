Due to a lack of guidance in urban systems thinking, China’s rapid urbanization has intensified the interactions and coercive effects between the various urban space subsystems. As a result, “urban diseases” such as environmental pollution, frequent earthquakes, and unbalanced urban–rural development have spread. As a complex giant system, the exploration of urban resilience enhancement is critical to ensuring the joint spatial development of cities and towns. Based on the PSR model, this study screens 38 indicators in five levels of the natural-material-economic-social-intelligent regulation subsystem of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area urban giant system, and constructs a multi-source data resilience assessment framework. Likewise, it employs the Geodetector model to investigate the key factors impacting the resilience mechanism. The results demonstrate that: (1) between 2011 and 2020, the overall resilience in the Hubei section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area increased from low to high and the coupled characterization of the “pressure-state-response” increased at different rates, with the state layer increasing the most; (2) the frequency of geological hazards, urbanization rate, and total number of early warning and monitoring of geological hazards are the key factors that contribute to changes in spatial resilience; (3) enhanced resilience is the result of the synergistic effects of different driving factors. Our model is used to assess the resilience of the urban system, assisting decision-makers in planning strategies to respond to urban system problems effectively and improve urban resilience.
