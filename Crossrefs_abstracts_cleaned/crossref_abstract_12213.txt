PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate risk propagation and resilience in the agribusiness supply chain (ASC).Design/methodology/approachThe paper undertakes a systematic literature review (SLR). Overall, 94 articles from six databases published between 2000 and 2022 underwent descriptive and thematic analysis.FindingsThere is a lack of research on risk propagation and resilience in the ASC for more than two decades. Accordingly, this research fills the gap in the extant literature by advancing the construct of risk propagation and resilience in the ASC and developing a framework proposing directions in risk propagation and resilience in ASC research.Research limitations/implicationsFirstly, only the Web of Science and Scopus databases were mostly used as primary sources while other databases were used as secondary sources to validate search results. Secondly, SLR is based on the peer-reviewed articles, books and conference papers; other non-academic sources relevant to the topic were not included in this paper.Originality/valueThe paper offers a set of constructs for understanding risk propagation and resilience in the ASC, develops a framework proposing directions in risk propagation and resilience in the ASC research and recommends three key themes for future research directions, namely, keep updated with recent constructs of risk propagation and resilience in the ASC, conduct case studies based on empirical studies to determine the current risk dependency and propagation in the ASC and conduct case studies based on empirical studies to determine resilience and sustainability in the ASC.
