Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM), a psychosocial intervention for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with serious illness, enhances resilience resources via four skills-based training sessions. A recent randomized controlled trial showed PRISM improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared to usual care (UC). This post hoc exploratory analysis aimed to better understand the effect of PRISM on HRQOL by describing changes in HRQOL subdomain scores. English-speaking AYAs (12–25 years) with cancer were randomized to PRISM or UC. At enrollment and six months later, HRQOL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Short Form (SF-15) and Cancer Module. Scores at each time point were summarized descriptively and individual HRQOL trajectories were categorized (<70 vs. ≥70). “Positive” trajectories indicate participants maintained scores ≥70 or improved from <70 to ≥70 during the study period. Baseline assessments were completed by 92 participants (48 PRISM, 44 UC); six-month assessments were completed by 74 participants (36 PRISM, 38 UC). For the SF-15, positive trajectories in psychosocial domains were more common with PRISM; trajectories in the physical subdomain were similar across groups. For the Cancer Module, positive trajectories were more common with PRISM in the following subdomains: nausea, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive, physical appearance, and communication. From this, we conclude PRISM may improve HRQOL, especially in psychosocial domains of wellbeing.
