It is not a state of stress immunity but the ability to adapt to different circumstances. This characteristic is highly important for future teachers and their teaching activities. To analyze resilience levels of future teachers of nursery, primary and secondary education. First, this study is ainstrumental research carried out to revalidate the CD-RISC (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) for teachers in training, and second, based on the foregoing results, it is a non-experimental empirical study. The participants were 373 students of degrees in Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Secondary Education from two Spanish Universities and a Chilean university. Exploratory and a confirmatory factorial analysis were sequentially used to identify the number and composition of factors, and central tendency and dispersion tests, analysis of variance, and effect size were calculated. The programs and statistical tests used were SPSS.22, FACTOR.10.8.01, M-Plus.7.3, and G*Power 3.1.9.2. The instrumental research revealed a bifactorial distribution, resistant personality, resources and control. Females, older individuals, and those who attend primary education showed higher resilience levels than males, younger people, and children in early childhood education.
