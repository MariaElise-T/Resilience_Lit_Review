Railway systems should be resilient to play a key role in creating sustainable development. Single-track railway lines are seen as potential bottlenecks due to limited capacity. More advanced railway interlocking systems (such as ETCS or satellite-based control systems) are being developed. On the other hand, the installation of these interlocking systems is a complex and time-consuming and costly task. For this reason, it is necessary to recognize the impact of potentially installed system with capacity, stability of timetable, quality, and other associated effects. The assessment is based on a set of simulation experiments using stochastic microscopic simulation model in the OpenTrack software tool. The focus is on railway operation with automatic block and automatic line blocking systems. If these two systems will have positive capacity effects, it is a basic presumption also for systems such as moving block (e.g., ETCS L3) to be effective. Research has shown that the significance of such measures can be best supported by linking to a matching timetable concept that will make full use of the benefits offered by these interlocking systems. The results reached in this research should be potentially applied, for example, by prioritizing of single-track railway lines for possible installation of such interlocking system. It can be achieved based on the capacity and operational effects examined.
