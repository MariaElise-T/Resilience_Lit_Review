AbstractBackgroundResilience is defined as an individual's ability to recover from difficulties and overcome challenges and adversity. Recognizing and measuring internal and external protective factors have been identified as important processes for building resilience, yet to date, no valid, and reliable scales of resilience in the Persian language have been developed that recognize both internal and external protective factors.MethodsThe present study was to translate the protective factors of resilience scale (PFRS) from English to Persian and analyze its psychometric properties among Iranians. Convenience sampling was used to gather data from January 2021 to February 2021 through digital internet scales, and 6 scales, including PFRS, Ryff's psychological well‐being scale, Rosenberg self‐esteem scale, life orientation test‐revised, positive and negative affect schedule, and short version of resilience scale (RS), were completed by 265 participants aged from 15 to 56. So, the aim of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of protective factors of resilience scale among Iranians.ResultsThe results of the face, content, and construct validity revealed that the Persian version of the PFRS measure had acceptable validity and reliability. The Cronbach alpha for the whole scale was 0.88, and the value of the content validity index was above 0.7. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the three‐factor structure model of the scale (fit indices: CMIN/df = 2.51, p < .01; comparative fit index = 0.94, goodness of fit index = 0.90, root mean squared error of approximation = 0.07).ConclusionIn conclusion, the Persian version of the protective factors of resilience is a reliable and valid measurement to assess the protective factors and internal and external protective factors of resilience in Iranians.
