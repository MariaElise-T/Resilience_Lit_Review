Abstract
Facing vulnerability of vernacular architecture existences, resilience capacity planning is involved as a strategic requirement for new established ecosystems of human settlement. Resilient capacity planning concept implementation will help local community to reduce impact of climate change and disaster risk, and also increase safety management. The research is intended to measure the resilience of urban system according to sustainable development for historical heritage and resilient approach that has applied in vernacular settlement. Vernacular architecture of Lampung is a suitable example for this research. Lampung is an area that has multi-culture acculturation, which is seen, in the social system of society, cultural patterns, building typologies and traditional settlement patterns. On the other hand, vernacular architecture of Lampung provides outstanding shelter from climate change and disaster risk, meets the requirements of local food security, where the development adjusts the cultural landscape, the potential of food sources and other natural resources. In addition, the development process also uses local technology and construction that adapts the environment and its location to ease the production land. However, there is much vernacular architecture, which have high socio-cultural potential and are not identified by academic researchers. By studying architectural vernacular, we not only repeat the way of life of the past, but also as a first step to create new technologies and designs in the future by learning the knowledge and technology applied in the past especially in Lampung. In this paper, researcher takes lead by conducting a review of important part of the existence of vernacular architecture to conduct resilience capacity planning strategy as a part of sustainable development in Lampung.
