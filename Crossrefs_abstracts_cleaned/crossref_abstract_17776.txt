Abstract  Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, an orphan disease also known as spinocerebellar degeneration, is characterized by a degenerative process of the cerebellum and spinal cord.  Method Biographical review of a Japanese woman known as Aya Kitou, using a qualitative approach of discourse analysis to identify resilience capacity, based on Boris Cyrulnik’s Biopsychosocial model.  Results Description based on the detailed experience reported in Aya´s diary; the areas to achieve resilience are identified (internal resources, sociocultural significance and social support system)  Conclusion Although the progression of the clinical condition compromised Aya”s functional capacity, limiting her autonomy and quality of life, it was evidenced that thanks to strong social networks individuals are more likely to achieve resilience, although the prevalence of social values and meanings upon the patient creates greater social anxiety and a greater feeling of inferiority and incapacity.
