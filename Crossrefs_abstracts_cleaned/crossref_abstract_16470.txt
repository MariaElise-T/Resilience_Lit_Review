 Multisystemic resilience has been conceptualised as involving a constellation of protective factors which operate at different levels to promote adaptation and thriving despite experiences of adversity. We used network modelling to discover how protective factors at two different systemic levels (intrapersonal strengths and social-ecological resources) interrelate, drawing on survey data from 5283 emerging adults ( M = 24.53Â years; 52% female) in Brazil, China, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. Results indicated that the level of connectivity within and between protective factor levels was similar between the countries, but that there was substantial variation in the specific interrelations among protective factors (both within and between levels), including the presence of some country-specific negative interrelations between protective factors at different levels. The findings support the importance of cultural context in studies of resilience, with implications for the development of appropriate resilience-building interventions for this age group.
