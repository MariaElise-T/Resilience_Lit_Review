IntroductionStudies have shown that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to long-term health problems; therefore, more attention should be paid to the mental health of university students. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal effects of preventive behaviors and psychological resilience on the mental health of Chinese college students during COVID-19.MethodsWe recruited 2,948 university students from five universities in Shandong Province. We used a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to estimate the impact of preventive behaviors and psychological resilience on mental health.ResultsIn the follow-up survey, the prevalence of anxiety (44.8% at T1 vs 41.2% at T2) and stress (23.0% at T1 vs 19.6% at T2) decreased over time, whereas the prevalence of depression (35.2% at T1 vs 36.9% at T2) increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001). Senior students were more likely to report depression (OR = 1.710, P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (OR = 0.815, P = 0.019), and stress (OR = 1.385, P = 0.011). Among all majors, medical students were most likely to report depression (OR = 1.373, P = 0.021), anxiety (OR = 1.310, P = 0.040), and stress (OR = 1.775, P &lt; 0.001). Students who wore a mask outside were less likely to report depression (OR = 0.761, P = 0.027) and anxiety (OR = 0.686, P = 0.002) compared to those who did not wear masks. Students who complied with the standard hand-washing technique were less likely to report depression (OR = 0.628, P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (OR = 0.701, P &lt; 0.001), and stress (OR = 0.638, P &lt; 0.001). Students who maintained a distance of one meter in queues were less likely to report depression (OR = 0.668, P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (OR = 0.634, P &lt; 0.001), and stress (OR = 0.638, P &lt; 0.001). Psychological resilience was a protective factor against depression (OR = 0.973, P &lt; 0.001), anxiety (OR = 0.980, P &lt; 0.001), and stress (OR = 0.976, P &lt; 0.001).DiscussionThe prevalence of depression among university students increased at follow-up, while the prevalence of anxiety and stress decreased. Senior students and medical students are vulnerable groups. University students should continue to follow relevant preventive behaviors to protect their mental health. Improving psychological resilience may help maintain and promote university students' mental health.
