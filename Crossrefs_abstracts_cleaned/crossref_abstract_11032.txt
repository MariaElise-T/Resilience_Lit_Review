 Recurrent natural disasters, the impact of economic turbulences, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have heightened concerns about constructing resilient systems. Supply chain weaknesses have been demonstrated in the past, encouraging the creation of preventative capabilities to retain competitiveness and respond to changes in both macro and local contexts. Examining the multiple risks presented in the culture and marketing of shrimp, as well as the measures taken by shrimp farmers to overcome the disturbances (producers of the groupâ€™s most valuable commodity), could provide insight into the current situation and aid in decision-making. Agility, distribution network structure, visibility relating producers to final consumers, communication between supply chain partners, sharing of benefits and uncertainties, global mapping and collaborative actions across supply chain partners were the drivers of supply chain resilience. Uncertainties associated with demand, supply, operational and environmental conditions were identified as supply chain vulnerability factors. The shrimp farmers maintain a balance between dependability measures and risks in the industry and continue the business, knowing that overcoming vulnerability could result in even higher susceptibilities.
