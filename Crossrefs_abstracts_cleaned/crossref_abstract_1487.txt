The contemporary environment of supply chains is characterized by discontinuity, being the source of unpredictable changes producing effects that are difficult to determine. Underestimating and not including the discontinuity in the managerial concept makes the supply chain homomorphic with respect to reality, thus, it is reflected only approximately (Jędralska, 1992). In other words, the situation of discontinuity is caused by the unreliability of the current management model. The answer to the discontinuity may be the formation of resilient supply chains that are aimed at developing specific patterns of adaptive behaviour. The aim of the article is to recognize the adaptive behaviours of a resilient supply chain in light of the assumptions of triple-loop learning in an organization. In the first part of the paper, the issue of a resilient supply chain is discussed, highlighting its adaptive capability. Next, the mechanism of preadaptation – adaptation of the supply chain based on triple-loop learning is explained. The final part of the paper presents the basic components of a resilient supply chain determining the adaptive behaviour consistent with triple-loop learning.
