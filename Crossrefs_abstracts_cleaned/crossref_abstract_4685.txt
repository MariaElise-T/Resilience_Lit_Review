Abstract
Climate change is increasingly impacting marine fisheries worldwide. Concurrently, scientific interest has grown to understand how these systems can cope and adapt, with research shifting from examining vulnerability to assessing risks to focusing on determining and operationalizing resilience. As fisheries-climate-resilience researchers and practitioners navigating a sea of frameworks, toolkits, strategies, policy goals, and management desires, we take stock to ask: what does resilience mean to us? Drawing on our experiences in the northeast United States, we discuss the challenges and ambiguity we encounter in concepts of social-ecological resilience and explore implications for research and implementation. We bring together perspectives to discuss various approaches to resilience, highlighting shared and unique challenges we face. We outline three key considerations as we move forward in resilience research and practice: (1) the need for greater transparency and reflexivity among researchers regarding how they frame and approach resilience; (2) the value of increasing coordination and communication among fisheries groups working on these topics; and (3) the use of co-developed and co-produced resilience research and strategies. We urge for greater centring of communities in these discussions and to explicitly consider how resilience interacts with equity outcomes.
