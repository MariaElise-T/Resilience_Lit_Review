Resilient stormwater infrastructure is one of the fundamental components of resilient and sustainable cities. For this, the resilience assessment of stormwater infrastructure against earthquake hazards is crucial for municipal authorities. The objective of this study is to develop a resilience assessment framework for stormwater pipe infrastructure against seismic hazards. A Bayesian belief network (BBN)-based stormwater infrastructure resilience model is constructed based on the published literature and expert knowledge. The developed framework is implemented in the city of Regina, Canada, to assess the cityâ€™s stormwater pipe infrastructure resilience. The outcome of the model indicates that proposed BBN-based stormwater infrastructure resilience model can effectively quantify uncertainties and handle the nonlinear relationships between several reliability and recovery factors. The model is also capable of identifying the most sensitive and vulnerable stormwater pipes within the network.
