However, it is different from the presence of a child with Down syndrome, this will have a major influence on the family, especially the mother who is the closest figure to the child. This study aims to determine the resilience determinants of mothers who have children with Down syndrome at the Surabaya POTADS Foundation.This study used an analytical observational design with a cross sectional approach by distributing questionnaires. The number of participants involved in this study was 10 participants where all participants had met the criteria to become participants using purposive sampling technique. The variables in this study are individual factors, family factors, community factors, risk factors, resilience. The instrument used is a questionnaire using a closed ended type dicotomy. Data analysis used logistic regression statistical test. (1) Based on the results of the Simultaneous Test (F test), it is known that the calculated F value is 2,930 < F table 4.53 or Sig is 0.135 > 0.05, which means H_1 is rejected. This shows that the independent variables, namely individual, family, community and risk have no simultaneous effect on the dependent variable, namely resilience, (2) Based on the results of the Partial Test (T test) it is known that the influence of the four independent variables, namely individual, family, community and risk individually on the dependent variable, namely resilience, the Sig value is obtained. > 0.05, so it can be concluded that the independent variable has no partial effect on the dependent variable. It can be concluded that there is no influence between independent variables (individual, family, community and risk) on the dependent variable (resilience) caused by several factors, namely low cognitive function, lack of coping strategies, low Locus of Control, negative self-concept and the absence of family support and low social skills.
