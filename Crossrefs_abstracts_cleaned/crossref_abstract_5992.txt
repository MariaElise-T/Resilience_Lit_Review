Abstract
The concept of urban resilience, either as a response to the effects of climate change or as a need to address the emerging challenges of the pandemic crisis, plays an important role in the modern forefront of urban policies. This article focuses, in the light of climate change, on the prospects of the adoption of the principles of urban resilience in the design of urban outdoor spaces, initially creating a clear framework for their definition. In order to achieve this, the article proceeds to the evaluation of successful European and Greek examples of urban open spaces in which the assurance of urban resilience is achieved through the application of bioclimatic design. Emphasis is placed on the factors of sunlight, ventilation, the role of water and greenery, and the properties of surface coating materials in urban outdoor spaces. Then the study area is analyzed, with qualitative and quantitative assessment of the factors that affect the outdoor environment.
