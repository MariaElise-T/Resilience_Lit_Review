Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has had many destructive impacts on socio-economic and health systems. The health systems of countries could be supportive in crisis management, but they also are affected by the impact of the crisis, consequently, their operational level has declined. This study pursued resilience in an overall national health system under pandemic stress.
Methods: Based on WHO building blocks, by interviewing informants of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, in Tehran-Iran, early 2021 a rich picture of the current situation depicted, the resilience model was extracted via a mixed method of Soft System Methodology (SSM) and total interpretive structural modeling (TISM). Dynamic capabilities were applied for the orchestration of the Iranian health system.
Results: Particular functional and structural suggestions applicable for designing a ubiquitous resilience model for the country-wide health system are presented in this study. The variables of crisis sensing, opportunity seizing, and reconfiguration are the cornerstones of health system resilience.
Conclusion: Well-suited health technology assessment (HTA) and health information system (HIS) play significant roles in the overall strengthening of the health system. All reforms for resilience will have a lasting result when the capabilities created by the resilience model are learned and reused in a dynamic cycle.
