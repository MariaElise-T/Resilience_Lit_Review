Both preclinical and clinical studies have pointed that aerobic exercise, at moderate
doses, is beneficial at all stages of life by promoting a range of physiological and neuroplastic adaptations
that reduce the anxiety response. Previous research about this topic has repeatedly described
how the regular practice of aerobic exercise induces a positive regulation of neuroplasticity and
neurogenesis-related genes, as well as a better control of the HPA axis function. However, limited
progress has been carried out in the integration of neuroendocrine and neuroplastic changes, as well
as in introducing new factors to understand how aerobic exercise can promote resilience to future
stressful conditions. Resilience is defined as the ability to adapt to stress while maintaining healthy
mental and physical performance. Consistent findings point to an important role of FKBP5, the
gene expressing FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), as a strong inhibitor of the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR), and thus, an important regulator of the stress response. We propose that aerobic exercise
could contribute to modulate FKBP5 activity acting as a potential therapeutic approach for
mood disorders. In this sense, aerobic exercise is well known for increasing the growth factor
BDNF, which by downstream pathways could affect the FKBP5 activity. Therefore, our manuscript
has the aim of analyzing how FKBP5 could constitute a promising target of aerobic exercise promoting
resilient-related phenotypes.
