Abstract
Psychological resilience is a necessary psychological quality for engineering normal college students to adapt to the social development and personal healthy growth. To explore the characteristics of “Internet plus” engineering and technical normal college students’ psychological resilience, we can use Hu Yueqin and Gan Yiqun’s Psychological resilience Scale Chinese Adolescent(RSCA) compiled in 2008 to conduct a questionnaire survey, which consists of five dimensions: Goal focus, emotional control, interpersonal assistance, family support and positive cognition. Taking 320 engineering normal college students as the object of study, this paper analyzes some characteristics of psychological resilience of engineering technology normal college students at present and finds out that the characteristics of the current engineering technology normal college students are as follows: There was no significant difference in sex, major and birthplace among engineering and technical normal college students, but the positive cognition and overall psychological l resilience of the only child were significantly lower than that of the non-only child. Moreover, this paper discusses the strategies to improve the psychological resilience of engineering technology normal college students from four aspects: society, school, family and individual.
