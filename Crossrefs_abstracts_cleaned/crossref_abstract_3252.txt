 This study presents a qualitative analysis of the subjective voice of minority women in which the women revealed three constitutional factors that enhanced their resilience: strong measures of self-efficacy, well-defined faith lives, and the ability to reframe barriers and obstacles. Relational factors that mediated success were close maternal relationships and positive relationships that served as sources of support within and outside the family at various developmental junctures.
