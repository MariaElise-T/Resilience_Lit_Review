To mitigate the climatic risk involved in the agriculture system, a shift from traditional cropping practices to climate-resilient practices of NICRA Project, is a strategy to increase farmers' income as well as agricultural sustainability. It reduces the risk to farmers from crop failure due to climate variations, by providing alternative suitable climate-resilient technologies. It also helps in the conservation of natural resources, increases food and nutritional security and helps in poverty alleviation by providing employment opportunities to the farmers.
