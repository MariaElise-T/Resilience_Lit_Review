This article provides a brief overview of current research regarding well-being among youth to find factors that may have influenced an increase in mental health problems among children and young people and to clarify the current state of knowledge. Research highlighting protective factors that seem to promote resilience is put forward, which includes factors regarding interactions between youth and their families, friends and education providers. An insight into the development of the Finnish education system is also provided in the search for factors that affect students learning and engagement in school. To provide a possible pathway forward, the article will highlight some existing studies on resilience building from nature-based activities, indicating a possibility to help youth and children with mental illness or problematic school absences develop socio-emotional skills, confidence in themselves and a belief in the future.
