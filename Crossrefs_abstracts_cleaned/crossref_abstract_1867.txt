This research examined the intention of Romanian tourists to travel nationwide in natural areas based on an
extended TPB (Theory Perceived Behavior) model, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the premise
was that people would prefer less risky experiences and would see ecotourism in protected areas as a form of
resilient tourism that reduces the threat of infection with the SARS-COV-2 virus or its mutations. This study tested
a conceptual model that showed that this intention was influenced by the three variables of the TPB model -
attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, complemented by other variables such as the feeling
of security offered to tourists by natural areas in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the motivations of tourists
that involve ecotourism in nature and cultural activities in Romanian natural areas, personal values in travel in
Romanian natural areas, civic attitude to support national tourism. The proposed research model incorporated
the construct of the feeling of security offered to tourists by Romanian natural areas as a result of the Covid-19
crisis, as a mediator between the attitude of traveling at national level and the motivations of tourists involved in
ecotourism in nature and cultural in the Romanian natural areas. In this context, the proposed model explains a
substantial proportion of the total variance of the intent-dependent variable in this study. In the long run, the
promotion of ecotourism, as a resilient form of tourism, in a pandemic context, could reduce the risk of spreading
the virus and contribute to supporting Romanian Eco destination so that national tourism recovers from the
economic crisis caused by the COVID pandemic 19.
