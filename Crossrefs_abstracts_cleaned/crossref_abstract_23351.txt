AbstractThe study tested an extension of a promising adaptive self‐reflective approach to resilience training. The extension integrated resilience training content in routine workplace activities via supervisors. Participants were military cadets (N = 168), randomized by platoon into two conditions. The control condition received the original self‐reflective resilience training only (n = 85), and the intervention condition additionally received a supervisor‐led extension of this programme (n = 83). Participants completed assessments of depression and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress at four time points over five months. Cadet performance scores were also obtained. Findings indicated that participants receiving the supervisor‐led extension demonstrated better psychological outcomes earlier than cadets in the control condition. However, at Time 4 both interventions had equivalent levels of mental health outcomes and perceived stress. The supervisor‐led condition demonstrated better average performance than the control condition for the performance measure congruent to the workplace activity in which the extension was applied. Mechanisms for the effectiveness of the supervisor‐led extension were explored. Analysis suggested that perceived supervisor support for the individual mediated the intervention–psychological outcome relationship. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of a scalable resilience intervention and speaks to a role of supervisors in facilitating resilience via supportive interactions.
