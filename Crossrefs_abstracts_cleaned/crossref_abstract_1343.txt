Due to the high penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) and emerging DER interconnection and interoperability requirements, fast and standardized information exchange is essential for stable, resilient, and reliable operations in microgrids. This paper proposes fast fault detection, isolation, and restoration (F-FDIR) for microgrid application with the IEC 61850 Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) communication considering the communication/system failure. GOOSE provides a mechanism for lightweight low latency peer-to-peer data exchange between devices, which reduces the restoration time compared to conventional client-server communication paradigm. The proposed mitigation method for the communication/system failure can find an available restoration scenario and reduce the overall process time. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed is designed and implemented with real time digital simulator, microgrid control system, and protection and control intelligent electric devices (IEDs) for the validation. The experimental results show that the proposed F-FDIR and IEC 61850 models can enhance the reliability and interoperability of the microgrid operation and enable self-healing microgrids.
