SummaryIn this paper, the resilient control problem is investigated for a wireless networked control system (WNCS) under denial‐of‐service (DoS) attack via a hierarchical game approach. In the presence of a wireless network, a DoS attacker leads to extra packet dropout in the cyber layer of WNCS by launching interference power. A zero‐sum Markov game is exploited to model the interaction between the transmitter and the DoS attacker under dynamic network environment. Additionally, with the attack‐induced packet loss, an H∞ minimax controller is designed in the physical layer by using a delta operator approach. Both value iteration and Q‐learning methods are used to solve the hierarchical game problem for the WNCS. The proposed method is applied to a load frequency control system to illustrate the effectiveness.
