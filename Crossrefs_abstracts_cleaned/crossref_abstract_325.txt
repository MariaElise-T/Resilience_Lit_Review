Resilience development is a growing field of study within the scholarly literature regarding social emotional achievement of at- risk students. Developing resiliency is based on the assumption that positive, pro-social, and/or strength-based values inherent in children and youth should be actively and intentionally developed. The core values of Invitational Theory and Practice of trust, optimism, care, intentionality, and respect can be applied to the values in other theories of resilience development. This paper argues that Invitational Theory and Practice also applies to the practices of resiliency development and should be considered a useful theory for culture change in pubic schools, alternative schools, and other educational organizations that serve at-risk children and youth.
