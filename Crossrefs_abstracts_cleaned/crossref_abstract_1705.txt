Introduction: By evaluating the level of resilience engineering and resilience engineering combined with safety, health, and environment, the priorities of medical centers to face crises are determined. Therefore, this study aimed to implement a risk assessment model with a checklist designed in a fuzzy environment.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, in 2014, in two Faraja hospitals in Iran, using two risk assessment forms including seven resilience indicators (24 sub-indices) and three integrated resilience indicators with safety, health, and environment (8 sub-index) was done that the final risk level in each index was calculated with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in the fuzzy environment and multiplied by the weight of each expert. Based on this, the priorities of each hospital were determined.
Results: In the evaluation results, it was found that in the first hospital, management commitment and transparency, and in the second hospital, flexibility are the main priorities. In both hospitals, management commitment in HSE, knowledge in HSE, and learning culture in HSE were RE-HSE priorities, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on these results, it is suggested to focus on all the parameters, especially the parameters related to management commitment indicators, transparency and flexibility in RE, and management commitment in HSE..
