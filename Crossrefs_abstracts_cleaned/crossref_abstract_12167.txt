The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship among general self-efficacy, resilience, life satisfaction and the extent to which the variables of resilience and life satisfaction contribute to the prediction of general self-efficacy. The study was carried out with 310 middle-aged adults in Burdur, 195 (%62.9) of which were female, 115 (%37.1) which were male and 70 (%22.6) of which were single, 227 (%73.2) which were married, 13 (%4.2) which were divorced. The General Self-Efficacy Scale, The Resilience in Midlife Scale (RIM-S) and Life Satisfaction Scale were used in the study. Correlation Coefficient of Pearson Moments and Hierarchical Regression Analysis were used in the analysis of the data. As a consequence, it was determined that there is a positive relationship among general self-efficacy, resilience, life satisfaction. Also, it was observed that the variables of resilience, life satisfaction significantly predict general self-efficacy.Â Keywords: General self-efficacy, resilience, life satisfaction
