Psychological resilience refers to the ability to respond adaptively. Although originally studied in the context of childhood trauma, resilience also appears to have benefits for employees. We investigate the impact of a structured workplace training programme building positive psychological capabilities (mindfulness, psychological flexibility, social support, time management, courage, optimism and mental toughness) believed to be associated with resilience. Forty-three local government employees participated in a seven-week seminar programme. Resilience was measured before, during and after the seminar series. Following the seminar series, resilience, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility increased. We conclude that employees could benefit through relatively short, inexpensive resource-based interventions around psychological resilience.
