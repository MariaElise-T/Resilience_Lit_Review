The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the mediating effect of resource orchestration on the relationship between leadership strategy and organisational resilience of banks listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange with an objective to contribute to knowledge production in the Global South using Kenya as the vantage point. The study applied a correlation research design, and data was gathered from a stratified random sample of 184 senior managers drawn across the 12 listed banks, wherein Likert-scale questionnaires were administered to the research participants online. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling was deployed for data analysis using SmartPLS software. Results showed that the mediated path explained 79.1% of the variance in organisational resilience (R2=0.791). The results were validated with a Sobel test that found a significant partial mediation in the model with Z=6.380 (p<0.05). The study inferred a strong and statistically significant mediation power of resource orchestration in the leadership strategy-organisational resilience nexus. Resource Orchestration Pecking Order was proposed as an outcome of the empirical analysis, and future research directions were suggested.
