Abstract
1. For sample H, with high modulus and high resilience, there is a greater crystallizing tendency above 350 per cent for the first cycle and above 400 per cent after previous flexing. 2. Both H and L have narrow loops, which indicate an approach to reversibility in the formation and deformation of crystalline regions above 400 per cent for the first and later cycles. 3. The crystallization of H is greatly enhanced above 400 per cent after the first cycle of stretching and retraction; L remains essentially unchanged by previous history over this range; this is analogous to the much greater change in the stress-strain loop from the first to third cycles for H, as compared with L. 4. At elongations below 400 per cent for the first cycle and 350 per cent for subsequent cycles, L has a far greater hysteresis or tendency to retain the crystalline arrangement, and this greatly increases after the first cycle, so that the fiber interferences persist on retraction to elongations 150 per cent below the elongation required for institution of organization on extension of the sample. Sample H is considerably more consistent in its behavior over the lower elongations, and between the first and later cycles. In other words, the tendency of H to return to the normal state on release of a deforming force is clearly evident, whereas L shows a marked tendency to retain a structure once set up. If resilience is the property of an elastic body related to the percentage of the potential energy introduced by applied stresses which is returned as work when the body returns to its original shape and size upon release of the stresses, then these x-ray data would seem to be consistent with the higher resilience of H; for ordinary measurements of resilience are evidently related to the lower ranges of deformation over which H returns to its normal state (disorder of macromolecules as in a liquid) so much more easily than L.
