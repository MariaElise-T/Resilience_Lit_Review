After the outbreak of COVID-19, the global service industry has been greatly damaged. In particular, the hotel industry, as an important component of the service industry, has encountered an unprecedented dilemma. In recent years, China has attached great importance to the development of the tertiary industry, so the development of the hotel industry has shown a positive trend before the outbreak of the epidemic. Both the scale and number of hotels have been greatly improved. In addition, the hotel industry is more sensitive to public events, so in the current era of frequent public crises, how the hotel industry can improve marketing resilience and better respond to emergencies has become a problem that must be considered and paid attention to. By using a case study, the Londoner Hotel in Macau is the main case to analyze the changes in marketing strategies made in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Its marketing strategy not only enables the hotel to complete the challenges brought by the COVID-19 epidemic, but also promotes the transformation and upgrading of its products, enhances its marketing resilience, improves its internal ability to respond to public crisis events, and promotes its sustainable development. This study integrates its strategies to provide feasible ideas and reference for other hotels to shape marketing resilience, and bring new inspiration to the sustainable development of the hotel industry.
