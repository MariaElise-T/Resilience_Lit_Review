Selecting the most resilient supplier is a crucial problem for organizations and managers in the supply chain. However, due to the inherited high degree of uncertainty in real-life projects, developing a decision-making framework in a crisp or fuzzy environment may not present accurate or reliable results for the managers. For this reason, it is better to evaluate the potential suppliers in an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy (IT2F) environment for better dealing with this ambiguity. This study developed an improved combined IT2F Best Worst Method (BWM) and IT2F technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model “Atieh Sazan” Co. as a case study, such that the IT2FBWM was employed for obtaining the weight of criteria. The IT2FTOPSIS was utilized for ranking the potential suppliers based on Hamming distance measure. In both phases, the opinions of experts as IT2F linguistic terms were employed for weighting the criteria and obtaining the relative importance of the alternatives in terms of the evaluative criteria. After obtaining the final results, the proposed model was validated by replacing Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) approaches separately instead of BWM for weighting the criteria. After executing both new models, it was found that the final ranking was similar to the final ranking of the proposed model, representing the reliability and accuracy of the obtained results. Moreover, it was concluded that the resilient criteria of “Reorganization” and “Redundancy” are the most determinant measures for selecting the best supplier rather than measures in the Iranian Construction Industry.
