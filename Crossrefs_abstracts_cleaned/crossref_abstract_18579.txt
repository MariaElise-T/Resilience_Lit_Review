Small urban streams are an important element of blue-green infrastructure
   that is often underused, especially regarding storm water management. In
   addition, small streams in dense urban areas often seem to be polluted and
   devastated, or even buried underground. This paper discusses the problems
   and challenges that occur in urban areas regarding small streams and creeks,
   and explores how their revitalization can help in shaping more resilient
   communities. The study explores two cities, Graz and Oslo, and their best
   practice examples in revitalizing urban watercourses. As a valuable natural
   ?blue? capital, small streams can reduce the city?s risk of flooding from
   intense rainfall and strengthen the ecosystem. At the same time, small urban
   streams are cost effective, proactive and attractive elements of urban
   landscape. Research identifies the benefits that the process of
   revitalization of small urban streams brought about to the selected case
   studies regarding the environment, public health, social interactions, land
   use and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the research establishes
   urban planning guidelines for revitalization of watercourses that could help
   in setting up policy framework for adapting inherited urban settings to
   climate change.
