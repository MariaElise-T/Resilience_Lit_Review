The current digital transformation (additionally accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic) is causing profound changes across a number of industries. Part of this revolution is the spread of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which enables the automation of business processes by replacing human work with advanced software robots. One of the goals of the conducted research was to develop a classification of approaches to RPA positioning in enterprises. The author also identified differences in RPA positioning between individual industries. Based on conducted literature research, the author has proposed a proprietary classification for approaches to RPA positioning: conservative, efficiency improving, and strategic. This was subject to verification based on the results of empirical research using multidimensional correspondence analysis. The survey was conducted by the author in 2020 using the CAWI method: Credible (reliable) results were obtained from 238 Polish enterprises. The multidimensional correspondence analysis, conducted on the basis of the results of the empirical research confirmed that the approaches to RPA positioning in enterprises proposed by the author did occur in business practice. The outcome of the RPA classification became the basis for qualitative research (in the form of semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners) aimed at answering the question as to whether enterprises that strategically position RPA and treat it as a tool for digital transformation increase their organizational resilience. Up until now, however, no study has been found that focuses on how RPA increases organizational resilience or what its consequences are both at the research and application levels. This article fills the research gap in this area.
