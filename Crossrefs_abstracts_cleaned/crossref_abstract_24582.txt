In Madagascar, faced with a galloping poverty rate, diseases, malnutrition, natural disasters, unemployment, illiteracy and illiteracy are hitting the population hard. In this context, social and economic aid aimed at an increasingly vulnerable population group is diversifying considerably. In general, humanitarians come to the aid of the most vulnerable to restore human dignity and alleviate the suffering of families in precarious situations. The question then becomes how will these humanitarian actions work to ensure resilience for socially sustainable development? This study, which aims to analyze the functioning of NGOs in the resolution of post-disaster socio-economic problems, allows us to affirm that taking into account the underlying factors: structural and situational, contributes to the achievement of the expected objectives for the strengthening of their resilience.
