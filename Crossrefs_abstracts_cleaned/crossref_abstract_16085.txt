The study investigated the mediating effect of adaptive behavior on the relationship between Resilience and job performance among public elementary school teachers. The sample comprised 310 general elementary teachers in Kiblawan District, Davao del Sur. Questionnaires using a 5-point Lickert scale were administered by the researcher. In the statistical analysis, adaptive behavior was the mediating variable, and the result was high. At the same time, Resilience was identified as the independent variable and had a high level. Job performance was the dependent variable due to the high level also. Path Analysis was used to establish the relationships among the variables. Results showed that Resilience and adaptive behavior are positively correlated, and the connection is significant.Similarly, adaptive behavior and job performance have a positive causal relationship, and the association is also significant. Likewise, Resilience and job performance also have a meaningful relationship and are positively correlated. Findings also revealed that adaptive behavior partially mediates the relationship between strength and job performance, such that the overall influence of Resilience on job performance is transmitted through adaptive behavior. In contrast, the widespread impact can be explained, either through direct or through mediation, by other variables that were not included in the established model of the study. This implies that Resilience influences adaptive behavior, which affects job performance.
