 The resilience (measured as changes in functional group representation and species composition) of bryophyte communities found in the younger-aged (“matrix”) forests surrounding old-growth remnants was examined in two different forest types, warmer, drier (Nimpkish) versus cooler, wetter (Sayward), on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Bryophytes were sampled within 10 m × 2 m belt transects (species composition only) and using 10 cm × 30 cm microplots (composition and abundance) in two age classes of matrix forest, clearcuts (age 7–20 years), and second-growth (age 25–49 years) as well as in remnant old-growth forest stands (age >300 years). The cover of all bryophytes was diminished and more patchily distributed in younger-aged stands; however, the richness and frequency of bryophyte functional groups showed different responses in the two younger age class forests. Disturbance-associated species exhibited both higher richness and frequency in clearcut plots and higher richness in second-growth plots. In comparison, the richness of species associated with old-growth was largely unchanged in younger-aged forests compared with old-growth forests; however, the frequency of occurrence of species associated with old-growth was significantly reduced in younger-aged forests. The cooler, wetter forests exhibited greater resilience, as the difference in species composition between second-growth and old-growth stands was less than that between second-growth and old-growth stands in the warmer, drier forests. The greater difference in second-growth species composition in the warmer, drier forests was attributed mainly to the persistence of disturbance-associated species.
