Introduction:In Germany, more than 3.3 million people in need of long-term care are receiving home care. Although not all of them use professional home care providers, their services are essential especially to those who need skilled nursing care and medical-technical assistance in addition to everyday supportâ€“such as approximately 30,000 people who receive home mechanical ventilation. Little is known about the disaster resilience of home care infrastructures and ways to strengthen them. A research consortium called AUPIK, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research from 2020-2023, sought to close this gap.Method:A participatory process was initiated as part of the AUPIK project based on results of a multi-perspective empirical baseline analysis which resulted in a first draft text about measures to promote disaster resilience in home care. 37 representatives of home nursing care providers and community health-care services, professional boards, scientific and education institutions participated in a web-based survey on the draft text, followed by two digital group discussions. Finally, the gradually revised, condensed and consented starting points were published and distributed.Results:Eight starting points were defined. Among others, there is an urgent need to strengthen risk awareness and resource management among home care providers, to promote individual disaster competence and preparedness among all parties involved and, not least, to strengthen community-based networking initiatives between home care providers, emergency and disaster organizations and local authorities. Institutions or persons who should take responsibility for implementation at different levels are addressed directly.Conclusion:The final version of the starting points represents a consensus on urgently needed initiatives to promote disaster resilience in home nursing care in Germany. The participatory development process should support commitment on the part of all stakeholders and thus promote effective implementation of disaster resilience initiatives in home nursing care.
