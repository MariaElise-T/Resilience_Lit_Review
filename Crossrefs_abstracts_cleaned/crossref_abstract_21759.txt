With the flourishing development of the urban metro system, the topology of important nodes changes as the metro network structure evolves further. The identical important node has distinct impacts on various metro networks’ resilience. At present, the dynamic influences of important station evolution on the resilience of metro networks remain to be studied further. Taking Shenzhen Metro Network (SZMN) as an example, the dynamic influences of the structure evolution of important nodes on the resilience of the metro network were investigated in this study. Firstly, the dynamic evolution characteristics of complex network topology and node centralities in metro systems were mined. Then, combined with the node interruption simulation and the resilience loss triangle theory, the resilience levels of distinct metro networks facing the failure of the same critical node were statistically assessed. Additionally, suggestions for optimal network recovery strategies for diverse cases were made. Finally, based on the evaluation results of node importance and network resilience, the dynamic influences of the topological evolution of important nodes on the resilience of metro networks were thoroughly discussed. The study’s findings help us comprehend the metro network’s development features better and can assist the metro management department in making knowledgeable decisions and taking appropriate action in an emergency. This study has theoretical and practical significance for the resilient operation and sustainable planning of urban metro network systems.
