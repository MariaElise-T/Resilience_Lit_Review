ObjectiveThe antimicrobial action of five drugs incorporated in temporary denture relines on the fungal biofilm was evaluated.Materials and MethodsA Candida albicans biofilm (SC5314) was formed on specimens (10 × 1 mm) of materials (Trusoft and Softone) modified or not (control) by the drugs (nystatin, miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and chlorhexidine diacetate). Cell viability was determined spectrophotometrically by the tetrazolium salt reduction assay (XTT) after 24 h, 48 h, and 7 and 14 days of incubation. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were those which inhibited 90% or more of fungal growth. Fungal susceptibility was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis.ResultsThe MICs of drugs incorporated in the materials were 0.032, 0.256, 0.128, 0.256, and 0.064 g ml−1 for nystatin, miconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and chlorhexidine, respectively. Images from nystatin, chlorhexidine, and ketoconazole demonstrated no viable cells.ConclusionsThe antimicrobials incorporated in the resilient materials inhibited fungal growth during 14 days, with lower MICs for nystatin and chlorhexidine.
