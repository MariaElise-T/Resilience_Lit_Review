The remote operation of a robotic arm by a human operator is considered as a simplified resilient system. In the experiments, subjects operated a robotic arm to carry out a simple task, while observing it through a monitor. The display of the monitor suddenly disappeared, and the subject continued the task only by using auditory information. By analyzing the relationship between task performances and types of auditory information through a mathematico-statistical method, it was found that not only auditory information related to the position but also the auditory information to ideate the position of the robotic arm was effective for task completion.
