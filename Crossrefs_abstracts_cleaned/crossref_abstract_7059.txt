 Objective Fear of hypoglycemia for children with diabetes influences parental life and could increase parental stress. The present study aimed to explore the association between resilience, the self-perception of the parental role, and fear of hypoglycemia in mothers of children with type I diabetes (T1DM).   Methods Ninety mothers (mean age: 44.20 years) of children with a T1DM diagnosis (mean age: 11.48 years) were recruited from an association for parents and completed an online self-report questionnaire packet that includes: Fear of Hypoglycemia Survey, Self-Perception of the Parental Role and Resilience Scale for Adults. Participants were recruited in 2017. Data collection lasted 10 months. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical package, version 22, and the PROCESS macro program by Hayes.   Results The analysis of the mediation model shows that resilience assumes a mediational role in the relationships between the parental role and preoccupation with hypoglycemia. In particular, the mother’s perceived competence and role balance can influence the development and increase of the mother’s resilience, which in turn can allow a decrease in the mother’s worry about the possible hypoglycemic episode of her child.   Conclusion The findings suggest that resilience is a significant topic to focus on in interventions designed to increase the self-perception of the parental role and reduce fear of hypoglycemia in mothers
