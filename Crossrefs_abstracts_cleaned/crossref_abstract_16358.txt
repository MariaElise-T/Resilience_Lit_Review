Flood disaster in the urban area can have an impact on the transport of people, goods, and animals. It will certainly result in the disruption of public transportation activities because the road and utilities are probably cannot be passed by vehicles. The objective of the research is to contribute to the analytical basis related to urban public transport services resilience evaluation during the flood. The simulation model is based on the assumption that the primary objective of an urban public transport service during a flood disaster is to continue serving passengers on a predefined service corridor. An example of the application and analysis of this simulation model, simulated for three floods condition, i.e. the first is a high flood prediction that may occur in Padang city (based on The Padang City Development Planning document) and two floods that hit in the year 2016 and 2017. These simulations showed that urban public transport service in Padang city is relatively vulnerable to flood disaster. Lesson learned here have implication for urban public transport services. An interesting outcome of this simulation model has obtained the deviation of urban public transport service route during the flood. There are many parameters that affect the resilience of urban public transport services in the face of floods, and these parameters could be a topic for future research
