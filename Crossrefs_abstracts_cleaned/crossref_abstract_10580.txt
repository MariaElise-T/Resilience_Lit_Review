 Resilience is the capacity to bounce back in the face of adversity and to go on to live functional lives with a sense of well-being. People can become resilient even though they may have lived in stressful and neglectful family and community environments. The author describes three case vignettes that illustrate how therapists and clients working together in a resilience framework can discover and bolster strengths that can lead to more enhanced and satisfying lives.
