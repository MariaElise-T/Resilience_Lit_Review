Gentrification is a complex process taking place in major cities around the world. This process varies from city to city and it is influenced by the specific conditions of each country. Both positive and negative impacts of gentrification can affect a city’s resilience. The aim of this paper is to assess and verify how residential and commercial gentrification is taking place in two selected locations of the municipal district Holešovice in the City of Prague. Both locations are attractive due to their proximity to the city centre. The paper focuses on two aspects of gentrification, i.e., the outcomes of demographic changes and its physical dimension, assessed by the visual complexity of building appearance. The results show the relationship and temporal continuity of residential and commercial gentrification. With its findings, the paper contributes to the knowledge base of urban studies following the identified growing need for commercial facilities in urban districts as a result of demographic changes.
