Integration of the lean and resilience paradigms has attracted increasing attention among scientists and practitioners. In an interconnected world, the need to be resilient involves increased readiness to deal with risks from both outside and inside an enterprise, and to be lean involves maximizing value while minimizing waste. The combination of these requirements has been the catalyst for a move towards lean–resilience operations. To better understand this trend, which seeks to help firms retain a competitive position and survive disruptions, this paper provides a systematic literature review of 53 articles identified through the C-I-M-O (context-intervention-mechanism-outcome) framework and examines them using descriptive and content analysis. The results trace the growth of lean–resilience research from its infancy to its current advanced state. This paper also identifies for the first time the lack of structured research on the number and categories of implemented practices and their associated benefits. To address this deficiency, a concept map is developed to provide guidance on the topic, identify gaps and inconsistencies in the literature, understand the state of development and suggest future research directions. The results are used to identify four dominant streams: application, compatibility, integration, and impact assessment in the context of the supply chain, conceptual development and operational research of various organizational and industry sectors. Further topics for investigation are recommended in the form of research questions. The proposed concept map is intended to assist researchers and practitioners to develop knowledge about the integration of lean and resilience paradigms in new contexts and formulate more effective deployment strategies.
