Many of the people who are most vulnerable to the effects of poverty and deprivation reside in informal settlements in Africa. While there is growing evidence of the importance of family resilience, there is little documented evidence of how collective actions undertaken by families in African communities can contribute to this. In‐depth interviews and focus‐group sessions were conducted with single mothers residing in an informal settlement in KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa to delineate the factors that contributed to their resilience. We examined the influence of social ties, self‐efficacy and networks they had established beyond their immediate community on enhancing family resilience. Three key themes are discussed: determination to survive, rising above harsh economic conditions and establishing networks within and outside the community. We conclude that the foundation for building strong female‐headed families lies in positive social ties, self‐empowerment initiatives and tapping on established networks within and outside low income communities.
