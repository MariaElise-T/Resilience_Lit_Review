The study adopted a quantitative research design utilizing a relational screening approach, and it involved a cohort of 282 willing mothers, selected through a criterion sampling technique. “Personal Information Form", "Psychological Resilience Scale for Adults", "Revised Berkeley Parenting Self-efficacy Scale" were used as data collection tools. The investigation of interrelationships among variables was conducted  through both correlation analysis and structural equation modeling. The study’s outcomes reveal a discernible positive association between participants' psychological resilience and their perceptions of parenting self-efficacy. It was found that the highest relationship with the parental strategies dimension of parenting self-efficacy was with the social resources dimension of psychological resilience, and the highest relationship with the perception of future dimension of psychological resilience was with the child outcomes dimension of parenting self-efficacy. Path analysis outcomes  substantiate that psychological resilience and its dimensions positively predict parenting self-efficacy. In  alignment with these empirical findings, it was concluded that there is a positive relationship between psychological resilience and its dimensions and parenting self-efficacy.
