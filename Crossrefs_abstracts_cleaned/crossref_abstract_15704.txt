Improving the resilience of the regional economy and the quality of the ecological environment under the background of the "double carbon" goal are important elements in the transition of China's economy from high-speed development to high-quality development. Taking the old industrial base in Northeast China as an example, this paper constructs index systems of regional economic resilience and ecological environment quality. Based on the panel data of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces from 2003 to 2020, the coupling coordination model was used to measure the degree of coordination between the two systems in Northeast China. The main conclusions are: First, the regional economic resilience and environmental quality have improved year by year, which reflects that the policies have been well implemented; Secondly, the coupling and coordination relationship between systems is continuously strengthened, and the process of integration in the Northeast region is constantly advancing; Finally, the degree of coordination between economic resilience and ecological environment needs to be further strengthened. Based on the above, this paper puts forward some targeted suggestions, hoping to provide ideas for promoting the coordinated development.
