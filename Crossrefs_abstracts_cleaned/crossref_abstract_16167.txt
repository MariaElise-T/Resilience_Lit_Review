There has been recent interest in the changing profession of educational psychology and the unique contribution it can make within evolving Children’s Services (Cameron, 2006). This paper provides an account of an innovative approach to Educational Psychology Service delivery that has been informed by research regarding effective methods of supporting change and development in educational settings. The account focuses on a development initiative within one West Midlands Primary School. The focus of the project with the school was to develop children’s resilience in relation to learning. It was concluded that although a long-term, collaborative approach to supporting school development was time consuming, it can have a greater impact at a classroom, whole school and community level than traditional training models. Given the high level of resources required for this approach, it would be useful to measure the longer term impact on learning and compare this approach with others in terms of cost effectiveness, particularly within the current economic climate.
