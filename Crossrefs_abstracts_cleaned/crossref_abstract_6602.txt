AbstractThe capacity of individual species to tolerate environmental changes is a major driver of ecosystem resilience. This subject has been a hot topic in boreal forests due to the greater effect of climate change anticipated at northern latitudes. However, to date it has been mainly examined for trees, with comparatively little emphasis on other species groups. In this study, bryophytes were sampled in the boreal forest of Québec (Canada) using a stratified sampling design allowing us to separate the effect of dominant canopy composition (two types: coniferous and mixedwood) and of the spatial climatic gradient (relatively warm and relatively cold sites) on bryophyte community structure (species richness and composition). The results indicated that bryophyte composition was different between coniferous and mixedwood stands. The impacts of spatial variation in climate were more visible in mixedwood than coniferous stands, indicating an interaction between stand type and climate. Specifically, bryophytes from mixedwood stands, and particularly specialist communities associated with deadwood and live tree bases, were climate‐sensitive and represent a potential target group to investigate the effects of climate change. In contrast, bryophyte communities from coniferous stands are stand structure‐sensitive, with little response to climate, presumably partly because coniferous canopies buffer climatic variations. Since bryophyte community sensitivity to regional variations in climatic conditions depends on dominant canopy characteristics and microhabitat availability, we suggest that adapted forest management practices could play a role in attenuating climate change impacts on these organisms.
