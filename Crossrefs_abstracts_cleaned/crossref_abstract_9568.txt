The major focus of the study was to use music to communicate, educate and disseminate information that helps curb suicidal and drug abuse cases among Zimbabwean communities. Zimbabwe as a country is facing severe economic challenges, which in turn has brought about much suffering to the people. As a result, some of them end up engaging in drugs or committing suicide in response to the challenges bewildering the country. This study was qualitative, superimposed on action research and a survey. Roadshows targeting some members of the Gweru communities were organised. The songs performed at the road shows carried lyrics meant to disseminate information about hope, inspiration, and patience. Purposively sampled respondents were drawn from a population of three communities in Gweru who attended the road shows that were held in their respective constituencies. The informants were picked up on the researchers’ knowledge of their capacity to inform the study. Open-ended interviews were conducted after the shows were held, to appreciate how effective the songs were in disseminating intended messages. The findings of this study revealed that the songs that were performed at roadshows helped in giving the people hope, encouragement, and perseverance in the wake of economic challenges as well as cultivating the spirit of hard work and resilience among them.  It can therefore be recommended that music therapy centres, road shows and other such performances be organised in various communities to help counsel people reeling from depression and other related illnesses.
