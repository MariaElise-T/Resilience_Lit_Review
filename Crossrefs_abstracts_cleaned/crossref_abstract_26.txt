Abstract
A study was made of the methods and machines used in measuring resilience and classified as of the impact, free oscillation, forced oscillation, or other type: A search of the literature revealed that resilience is affected by numerous factors, such as temperature, duration of loading, magnitude of stress, method of applying stress, amplitude, frequency, and energy losses during measurement ; by shape and thickness of the sample, and by the state of cure, amount and type of plasticizer, amount and type of fillers, and the type of elastomer used. A series of Neoprene compounds was compounded, cured, and tested to determine the effect of various classes of carbon black on the resilience of the Neoprene elastomer, which is the most resilient commercially made rubber material. The resilience was found to decrease as the carbon black particle size decreased. A second series of compounds utilizing 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 parts of medium thermal carbon black based on the Neoprene were tested, and the results show that resilience decreases with increase in loading. A comparison of the physical properties of these compounds with those of the currently used natural-rubber packing shows that the former are superior for replacing the natural rubber in mechanisms. The Neoprene compounds possess better tensile strength, elongation, resilience, aging, and oil resistant properties than the rubber compound, but are slightly inferior in low-temperature flexibility.
