First paragraph:  In this summer issue, we offer the first installment of a special set of papers in response to the call entitled “Fostering Socially and Ecologically Resilient Food and Farm Systems Through Research Networks,” sponsored by the tripartite partnership of the Inter-institutional Network for Food, Agriculture, and Sustainability (INFAS), eOrganic, and the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). We appreciate their support for furthering the literature on this topic. Additional papers in response to the call will follow in the forthcoming fall issue. . . .
