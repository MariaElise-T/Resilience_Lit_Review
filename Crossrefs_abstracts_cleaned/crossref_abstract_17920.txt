The microservice architecture has many advantages, such as technology heterogeneity, isolation, scalability, simple deployment, and convenient optimization. These advantages are important as we can use diversity and redundancy to improve the resilience of software system. It is necessary to study the method of improving the resilience of software system by diversity implementation and redundant deployment of software core components based on microservice framework. How to optimize the diversity deployment of microservices is a key problem to maximize system resilience and make full use of resources. To solve this problem, an efficient microservice diversity deployment mechanism is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we creatively defined a load balancing indicator and a diversity indicator. Based on this, a diversified microservices deployment model is established to maximize the resilience and the resource utilization of the system. Secondly, combined with load balancing, a microservice deployment algorithm based on load balance and diversity is proposed, which reduces the serviceâ€™s dependence on the underlying mirror by enriching diversity and avoids the overreliance of microservices on a single node through decentralized deployment, while taking into account load balancing. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms.
