Abstract
This paper assesses the prospective contribution of social-ecological resilience thinking in advancing a theory of ‘ordinary’ cities. Building on the hierarchical divide that continues to prescribe analyses and representations of cities in urban studies, the paper suggests that, while ideologically contentious, the conceptual configuration of resilience thinking, promoted essentially through notions of uncertainty, diversity and transformation, shows considerable potential for interdisciplinary research. While remaining cautious about its analytical thresholds, applying the framework as it emerges from its ecological niche suggests that resilience thinking can, alongside other concepts, play a part in creating an enabling environment for broadening the way communities, neighbourhoods and institutions that form and connect cities across the globe are understood, studied and represented in urban theory; allowing us to recognise all cities and their citizens as relatable and ‘ordinary’.
