This paper derives expressions for the sound pressure due to free-space resilient and rigid strips in cylindrical coordinates. A method is derived for improving the convergence and reducing the error of the expansions for radii less than the one-sided strip width. Low-frequency approximations are also derived, which simplify calculation at low frequencies, and expansions for the far-field responses are derived. The results are verified by comparison with direct numerical solutions.
