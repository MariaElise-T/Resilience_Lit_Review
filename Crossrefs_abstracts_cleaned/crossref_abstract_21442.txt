The objectives of the study were: a) to estimate the direct effect of life events on the dimensions of quality of life (Physical Health, Psychological Health, Social Relations, and Environment), b) to estimate the indirect effect of perceived stress on the relationship between events vital and the dimensions of quality of life, c) the moderation of resilience and sex on both effects in university students. 327 university students participated, 56,9% women, aged between 18 and 24 years. Perceived stress was found to mediate the relationship between life events and the quality-of-life dimensions. It was also found that sex and resilience did not moderate the direct and indirect effect in any of the dimensions of quality of life. This study provides proof of the mechanisms of perceived stress, resilience, and sex on the relationship between life events and the quality of life of university students.
