Asian family caregivers of older adults with dementia have stressful caregiving situations over long periods; they must become resilient to recover from adversity. A conceptual definition of resilience specific to Asian family caregivers is important for understanding their caregiving phenomena and the relationships with mental health and psychological well-being. The purpose of this concept analysis was to define resilience in family caregivers of Asian older adults with dementia using Walker and Avant's method. The findings of the analysis will guide future research about the modifiable factors that will prevent negative health outcomes in this population of caregivers.
