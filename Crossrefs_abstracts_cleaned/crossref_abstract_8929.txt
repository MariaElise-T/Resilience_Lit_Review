SUMMARY
The objective of this study was to investigate the difference in resilience level of high-level volleyball players. Ninety-eight volleyball players (National team players U21, Pre-League and Second Division A2 teams’ players) participated to the study (fifty females and forty-eight males). The Self Evaluation Resilience test was used for the study. The data were analyzed with SPSS 21.0 using t-test for independent samples, and one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni adjustment test. Results showed statistically significant differences between the males and females volleyball players in variables ‘‘orientation on solution and aims’’’ and ‘‘self-efficacy’’. Additionally, statistically significant differences were observed in the variables ‘‘orientation on solution and aims’’, ‘‘healthy lifestyle’’ and ‘‘self-efficacy’’ according to players team category. Future research should investigate if the behavior of the coach in the team, or the team category affects the resilience level of the players
