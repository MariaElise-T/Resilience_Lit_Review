<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Ego-resiliency is attributed the status of a “meta resource” that is responsible for a flexible selection of coping strategies depending on the requirements of a specific difficult situation. A considerably burdensome critical life event is the development of a chronic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Apart from coping with the symptoms, a fundamental task confronting patients is maintaining their quality of life. This raises the question of whether ego-resiliency serves as a mediator between coping strategies and quality of life. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> 210 RA patients were invited to participate in this study. They were requested to complete a questionnaire that included the Satisfaction with Life scale, the stress coping inventory Mini-COPE, and the Ego-Resiliency scale. The collected data were analyzed by a simple mediation procedure and estimation of simple correlation coefficients. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The analysis demonstrated that ego-resiliency (<i>r</i> = 0.46; <i>p</i> &#x3c; 0.001) and emotion-focused coping (<i>r</i> = 0.39; <i>p</i> &#x3c; 0.001) determined life satisfaction. Additionally, ego-resiliency mediated the relation between emotion-oriented coping strategies and life satisfaction. Partial mediation was observed (<i>a</i> = 0.45**; <i>b</i> = 0.36**; <i>c</i> = 0.39**; <i>c’ =</i>0.22**; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.24; <i>F</i> = 35.65; <i>p</i> &#x3c; 0.001). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Our observations partly support the assumption about a controlling role of ego-resiliency in the process of selecting coping strategies according to demands of situations.
