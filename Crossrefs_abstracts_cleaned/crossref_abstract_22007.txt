 This study investigated the consistency of stress responses to different sources of stress during simulated multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation. Of particular interest is whether or not resilience is a general factor that predicts stress response across different stressors. Participants completed two 10-minute test conditions designed to induce stress âˆ’ one through high workload and another through negative evaluation. DSSQ factors gauged subjective stress response and physiological measures gauged objective stress response. Three trait resilience measures were predictors of these stress responses. Results revealed that different resilience scales and subscales predicted different response components. These findings suggest that individuals vary in their vulnerability to specific stressors. Training and personnel selection could thus benefit from a comprehensive, multifaceted assessment of resilience.
