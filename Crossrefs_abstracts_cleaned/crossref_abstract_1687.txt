 Project teams carrying out innovation projects are investigated during critical incidents. Earlier, a Team Innovation Resilience Behavior (IRB)-scale was successfully applied to quantitative survey data (Oeij, 2017). Team IRB is the team's capacity to effectively deal with possible incidents and ensure the project's continuation. This study uses qualitative data to validate the Team IRB concept. Methodologically, it is concluded that the concept of Team IRB allows for its application to both qualitative and qualitative data. The content conclusion is that teams that score highly for Team IRB are better in recovering from critical incidents than they are in preventing critical incidents.
