The capital construction phase of the CSG–LNG projects in Queensland has required significant investment in employment, and provided opportunities for local contractors with spillover effects for the regional economy. As these projects transition into the operational phase they will sustain a different supply chain profile, which has implications for the local economy.
The authors’ primary question is, how do local business adapt to these changes?
Initial results indicate that some businesses adapt better than others. The authors call these small to medium sized (SME) businesses resilient organisations.
Building on data from a survey of SMEs in the gasfields, the authors show how resilient firms are able to learn, adapt, innovate and renew in response to these environmental changes.
The findings suggest ways to support SMEs to adapt to the changes brought about by this economically important industry. The findings from this study also have wider implications for other regions in Australia and around the world that may encounter significant oil and gas investments in the future.
