AbstractAn academic career in aging research is filled with the incredible highs of important discoveries that improve the lives of older adults and repeated lows when papers and grants are rejected or studies are negative. To normalize the experience of setbacks and failures in aging research, we invited three senior investigators to share their journeys of persistence and resilience as they have navigated their research careers. This career development symposium was presented at the 2021 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Geriatrics Society, which was held virtually. We aimed to connect researchers in aging, especially trainees and junior investigators, through personal stories of persistence and shared strategies to build resilience and respond to setbacks with a growth mindset.
