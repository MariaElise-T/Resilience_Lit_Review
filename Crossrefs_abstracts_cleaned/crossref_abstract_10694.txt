This study explores the significance of two determinants: Supply Chain Capabilities and Supply Chain Visibility, in the intricate interplay among Supply Chain Resilience, Supply Chain Performance, and Firm Performance. A dataset comprising 221 participants from Vietnamese garment manufacturing firms was gathered and subjected to analysis using the PLS-SEM approach, revealing insights into the modeled complex relationships. The research findings reveal that visibility significantly influences supply chain resilience; while the hypotheses of a positive impact of supply chain visibility and supply chain resilience on firm performance have been rejected. Interestingly, these findings underscore the significant influence of indirect relationships mediated by factors, such as supply chain resilience and supply chain performance. Hence, this study bridges a gap in the existing body of literature and offers practical implications for supply chain management, particularly concerning performance measurement challenges in this sector. The article suggests that the Vietnamese garment supply chain could enhance supply chain and firm performance by focusing on supply chain capabilities and visibility.
