Prefabricated building holds promise for quality, efficiency, and sustainability when compared to traditional techniques. However, realizing prefabricated building work hinges on strengthening supply chain resilience. This research assesses interdependent risks undermining prefab network continuity during disruption. Questionnaire data from industry experts informed a structural equation model quantifying pathways between component production, construction, information, and other uncertainties. Findings confirm that project delays can be traced to manufacturing and on-site risks, with information gaps broadly propagating impacts. Meanwhile, organizational risks have an insignificant influence, suggesting partnership networks readily reconfigure around operational contingencies. Robust information infrastructures and coordination, therefore, offer crucial leverage. Accordingly, a multidimensional resilience enhancement strategy is formulated, prioritizing supply chain transparency, digital integration, inventory buffering, contingencies planning, and transportation flexibility. Our mixed-methods approach advances the construction literature by demonstrating the applicability of structural equation modeling for diagnostic resilience analytics. Industry leaders also gain actionable, evidence-based guidance on strategic investments to stabilize project flows. This dual theoretical and practical contribution underscores the versatility of tailored statistical assessments in furthering construction innovation objectives within complex, uncertain environments.
