The resilience of tourist destinations is nowadays an essential means for a successful and efficient management of all sectors. In Morocco, the tourism sector, whose revenues are ranked third nationally, should be strengthened and immunized against all risks and contingencies (Covid-19 as an example) that can slow down or hinder its growth and constitute a locomotive of socio-economic development.  This paper is a review of the theoretical literature on the resilience of tourist destinations. The study focuses on twenty or so articles that have been subjected to a rigorous textual analysis. And finally, it can be concluded that the latter revealed that resilience is determined mainly by two parameters, risk management and vulnerability.
