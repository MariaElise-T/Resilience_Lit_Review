People with disabilities have become a serious issue concerning public health in recent years, and people with disabilities are chronically stigmatized and might internalize attitudes and behaviors that they perceive from the majority, which can affect their day-to-day social participation, mental health, and well-being. Research has consistently found that greater resilience can mitigate the negative effects of stressors and has a positive impact on the psychological issues of stigmatized groups. This study investigates the effects of resilience on urban disability. Using tracing process technologies and taking Hong Kong as a case, findings from the study suggest that supportive policies and regulations are available and have several, but ill-conceived policymaking and undesirable implementation are typical existing issues. This review indicates that resilience can be enhanced by intensifying the disabled personâ€™s sense of self-control in both community participation and over their own lives in the case of the difficulty of making significant changes in every aspect of life in the short term. The important role that government plays is undoubtedly by presenting a solid and positive attitude to taking the lead role and facilitating the fundamental change in the majority's mind and laws by inspiring social enterprise and the public.
