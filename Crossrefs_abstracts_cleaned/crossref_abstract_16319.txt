AbstractIn this modern era of cyber–physical–social systems, there is a need of dynamic coordination strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance the resilience of modern power distribution networks (MPDNs). This paper proposes a two‐stage EV coordination framework for MPDN smart restoration. The first stage is to introduce a novel proactive EV prepositioning model to optimize planning prior to a rare event, and thereby enhance the MPDN survivability in its immediate aftermath. The second stage involves creating an advanced spatial–temporal EV dispatch model to maximize the number of available EVs for discharging, thereby improving the MPDN recovery after a rare event. The proposed framework also includes an information system to further enhance MPDN resilience by effectively organizing data exchange among intelligent transportation system and smart charging system, and EV users. In addition, a novel bidirectional geographic graph is proposed to optimize travel plans, covering a large penetration of EVs and considering variations in traffic conditions. The effectiveness is assessed on a modified IEEE 123‐node test feeder with real‐world transportation and charging infrastructure. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in MPDN resilience with smart restoration strategies. The validation and sensitivity analyses evidence a significant superiority of the proposed framework.
