We explored the relationship between environmental restoration and psychological healing and the ecological optimization and healing function of the waterfront landscape from the perspective of resilience in the Xinglin Bay landscape belt of Jimei District, Xiamen City, China through qualitative research, in-depth interviews, and field investigations. 63 interviewees were invited from October 12 to 16, 2022 to collect data on their activity and psychological feelings in the area. The results showed that gender and frequency of activities were important variables affecting the effectiveness of landscape healing. Hydrophilic items in the Xinglin Bay landscape adopt the theme of resilience to promote the interaction between people and the environment, thereby subtly changing the cognition of visitors. The results of this study prove the relationship between resilient landscapes and physical and mental healing, highlighting the importance of the resilient design of waterfront landscapes in the urban environment and social development.
