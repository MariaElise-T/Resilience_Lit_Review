Abstract
The concept of resilient cities can be considered as a way of enabling not only dealing with added and severe shocks but also tackling the many challenges that constrain businesses, jobs and livelihoods. Hence, a major part of the building is resilience, which aims to find solutions to reduce poverty levels and find more general solutions to improve the quality of human life. There are more interventions in urban areas - conducted by stakeholders everywhere to achieve a certain level of resilience through the development of housing, infrastructure and services. The objectives are to develop knowledge about the contributions of cities to mitigating the impacts of climate change for urban planners and all those interested in urban development, climate change, environmental sciences and engineering. This research shows the most important factors that cities take, and what actions are taken to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It also identifies promising mitigation and adaptation strategies that promote sustainable development and are geared towards resilience.
