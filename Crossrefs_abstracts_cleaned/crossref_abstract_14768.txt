The authors evaluated the differential relationship between mutuality, hope, and spirituality for predicting resilience among 253 young adult participants (47 men, 206 women; M = 22, SD = 5.7) with a history of abuse (n = 64) and without (n = 189). Backward stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed statistically significant models in populations with a history of abuse (p < .01, R2 = .43) and those without (p < .01, R2 = .36), with no statistical difference in the variance between models (z = 0.51, p = .30). Implications for counselors are provided.
