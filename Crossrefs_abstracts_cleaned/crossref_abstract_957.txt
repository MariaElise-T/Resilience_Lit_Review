AbstractNowadays, due to network expansions, system operators are dealing with natural events including system failures. Evaluating the system readiness to maintain the network interconnections during severe faults are known as an important challenge of today's distribution networks. To do this, this paper presents an online non‐model‐based scheme of evaluating the system resiliency and supplying critical loads within severe natural conditions. In this case, by developing system resiliency as multi‐metric decision making problem and proposing the Choquet integral and graph theoretic methodology, the system resiliency is evaluated. The proposed resiliency scheme is an online non‐model‐based approach can be used for all distribution system configurations with the potential of natural event failures. In this case, by proposing online resiliency criteria based on the system critical loads and branches and developing the proposed criteria on Choquet integral scheme in the form of optimization procedure, the system resiliency is evaluated. The validity of the proposed approach is carried out on two different systems including the IEEE 123‐bus test system and the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) microgrid. Simulation results present effectiveness of the proposed scheme to provide proper protective switching strategy and design the system resiliency criteria for future distribution systems.
