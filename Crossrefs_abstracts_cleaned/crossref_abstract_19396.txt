This study investigated demographic factors, teaching characteristics, psychological characteristics, school-related characteristics, professional efficacy, and subjective health perceptions among PE teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional research design. Questionnaires were distributed to PE teachers online during COVID-19 closures. PE teachers (N = 757) from elementary, middle, and high schools in Israel voluntary completed surveys on the topics of stress levels, self-resilience, remote teaching, professional efficacy, and subjective health perception. Sex, remote-teaching experience and clear remote school policy significantly predicted professional efficacy. Sex, teaching experience and self-resilience significantly predicted subjective health perception. This study demonstrated the need for a clear remote policy, as it likely empowers teacher professional efficacy. Transparent procedures and guidelines, along with clarifying remote policies by a supportive administration, are important for the professional efficacy of PE teachers. In addition, educational programs that are aimed at developing and strengthening the values of a healthy, positive, and balanced lifestyle are important to subjective health perception among PE teachers.
