Summary
In this article, the use of sport as a coping strategy by South Sudanese youth who have suffered the trauma of forced migration is examined. This article explores the relationship that has emerged between the young people and sport, in particular basketball, and how they use their participation in basketball and sports to cope with the stressors of their lives. The research intended to explore to what degree sport can play in improving mental health and what mental health interventions, in general, were being sought by this marginalized demographic. This qualitative study was underpinned by the psychosocial conceptual framework. We undertook semi-structured interviews with 23 South Sudanese youth aged 14–21 years, we also conducted focus groups of 11 South Sudanese elders and parents. The results of this research were feed back to the wider South Sudanese community through two forums. The data collected were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of the study identified sport as an important coping strategy for the participants, both as a diversion from drug and alcohol misuse, potential criminal activity and as a way to self-manage the symptoms of anxiety and depression they were experiencing, and a mechanism to enhance self-worth. The study also indicated there was a lack of mental health interventions for these young people and that they had shown a great deal of resilience to develop their own ways to deal with the trauma they had experienced. The research reported positive associations of wellbeing and participation in sport, however more research needs to be conducted to ascertain the extent to which sport impacts mental health and how this can be incorporated into interventions for Sudanese youth and young people from similar forced migration and resettlement backgrounds. This study suggested that sport can be a driving force of good for many of the young people’s lives, worthy of further research.
