Abstract
Merdeka Square, where National Monument stand, is the pride of Indonesia citizen. Many festivals or “Pesta Rakyat,” such as nation ceremonies, religious events, and New Year’s Eve have been held there as determined by government regulations. There are 249 events, including festivals, that were held in year 2018 (source: Utilization of National Monument Area data). Unfortunately, they often cause environmental damage particularly on Taman Monas, the park where vegetation dominates the area. Thus, it charged initial atmosphere and function of the square and restricts people flexibility to spend their leisure time or recreation in there. In the meantime, vegetation refinement takes time. Their recovery depends on the level of damages of the plaza. With the data shown descriptively collected from the results of observations and interviews, this study focuses on Taman Monas resilience, mainly based on the vegetation, which happened due to the festivals. The purpose of this study is to know Taman Monas, as recreation space, resilience on vegetation in the way to response festival or Pesta Rakyat.
