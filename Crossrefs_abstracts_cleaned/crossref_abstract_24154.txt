AbstractObjectivePatients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at increased risk of poor health‐related quality of life (HRQOL). This study examined clinical caseness on depression and anxiety mediate the relationship between resilience and HRQOL in patients with breast cancer.MethodsA total of 193 patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy completed questionnaires including the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Breast before the first session (T0), before the start of the last session (T1), and 6 months after the end (T2) of chemotherapy. Mediation analyses using a bootstrapping method was performed.ResultsThe indirect effect (IE) through T1 depression was significant (IE through depression = 0.043, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.002–0.090]), while IE through T1 anxiety was not significant (IE through anxiety = 0.037, 95% CI [−0.010–0.097]) in the association between T0 resilience and T2 HRQOL.ConclusionsClinical caseness on HADS depression subscale during chemotherapy was a mediating factor of the relationship between resilience before chemotherapy and HRQOL after chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Depression during chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer may be a target symptom of screening and intervention to maintain the HRQOL after chemotherapy. Also, patients with low resilience are more likely to develop depression during chemotherapy, and clinicians should carefully monitor whether depression occurs in these patients with low resilience.
