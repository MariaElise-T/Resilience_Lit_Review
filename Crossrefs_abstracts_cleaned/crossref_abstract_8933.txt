ABSTRACTThis study aims at investigating the influencing factors on hospital resilience. For this purpose, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. Six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, SAGE, EBSCO, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2018. Sixteen studies were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Content analysis revealed 22 influencing factors were included in a framework with 2 dimensions: (1) phases of the hospital resilience process (preparation, response, and recovery/growth) and (2) the key components of the hospital (staff, infrastructure, management, and logistics). Considering the factors that emerged from this research, suggestions were made to improve hospital resilience. The results of this research will enable a hospital manager to develop better plans for hospital preparedness, as well as perform more effectively before, during, and after disasters.
