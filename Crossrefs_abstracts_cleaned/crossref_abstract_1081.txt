Abstract
The EU offers different funds to member states for investments and development in infrastructure, governance, economy, and society. They are targeted towards the EU priorities and national necessities, offering the chance for member states and partner states to adapt to the new challenges. The COVID 19 pandemic tested states, societies and economies, and pinpointed towards needs which previously occupied a less important role in EU funding. Moreover, European states needed tailor made solutions for the post-crisis context, which will help them recover fast from the domino effect of the pandemic. All these were gathered in the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which, based on national plans, offer funds for a rapid recovery and investments in key sectors. The mechanism revealed an entire philosophy in approaching resilience and recovery, as, even if states followed the same rules in developing the plan, they oriented funds for different investments, reforms or activities.
The present article overviews the manner in which states channeled their resilience and recovery plans, as they offer different philosophies in approaching recovery and resilience.
