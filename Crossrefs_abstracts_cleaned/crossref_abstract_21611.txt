 Previous studies have implied that physical activity profoundly influences interpersonal adaptation. However, this effect and its mechanisms have not been directly verified, especially for adolescents. This study examines the association between physical activity and interpersonal adaptation in adolescents through self-esteem and psychological resilience after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Participants included 542 Chinese adolescents (aged 13â€“18 years; 242 boys and 300 girls). Adolescents in China anonymously completed a series of questionnaires, including the PARS-3 Scale of PE Activity Grade (PARS-3), the Self-esteem Scale (SES), the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (RSCA), and the Interpersonal Adaptation Scale. The results showed that physical activity positively correlated with self-esteem, psychological resilience, and interpersonal adaptation. Additionally, self-esteem and psychological resilience serially mediated the impact of physical activity on interpersonal adaptation. The findings highlight the positive impact of physical activity on adolescent interpersonal adaptation by strengthening positive psychological resources in the post-pandemic era.
