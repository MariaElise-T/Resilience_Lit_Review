This study sought to examine the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on local communities whose residents are directly or indirectly affected by city tourism. Qualitative research was conducted via in-depth interviews and Leximancer software analysis to explore locals’ perceptions in two highly tourism-dependent southern European cities. While the crisis has had predominantly negative impacts on tourism, the pandemic’s positive effects could contribute to cities’ greater resilience and more sustainable tourism models. The results highlight the variables that residents perceive as having the most influence on city tourism, as well as providing insights into locals’ expectations for the future.
