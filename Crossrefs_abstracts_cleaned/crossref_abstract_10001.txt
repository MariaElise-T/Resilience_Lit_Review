 The purpose of this study was to identify factors distinguishing Mexican American women living near the U.S.-Mexican border who are resilient to the experience of stress from those who are not. The study sample consisted of 418 participants ranging in age from 20 to 61 years. Data were gathered through a self-report survey instrument composed of items assessing stress vulnerability, acculturation, health, physical activity, education, and marital status. Descriptive discriminant analysis was used to determine which variables made the greatest contribution in discerning between stress-resistant and stress-susceptible women. The results indicated that higher educational attainment, greater acculturation, better health status, and marriage differentiated between those women reporting themselves resilient to the effects of stress and those reporting being vulnerable. These results have implications for stress resilience promotion among this population group.
