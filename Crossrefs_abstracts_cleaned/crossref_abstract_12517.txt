IntroductionAmong the patients, 6.6% with past-year major depressive disorders attempt suicide in their life. Resilience (the ability to respond positively to adversity) and coping strategies (the ability to manage living stresses) may be protective factors against suicide ideation and behavior. A study conducted on 100 abstinent substance dependent patients suggested that suicide attempters had significantly lower resilience scale scores. Other authors demonstrated that intrinsic religiosity, resilience, quality of life were associated with previous suicide attempts in depressed patients.AimTo examine the correlation among resilience, coping strategies and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics in depressed patients.MethodsFrom December 1st 2014 to December 31st 2015 we recruited inpatients and outpatients aged > 18 years with a diagnosis of depression (current or past). At baseline, patients were assessed with Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Resilience Scale for Adult and Brief-COping with problems experienced; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were gathered. Follow-up was conducted after 1 year in order to assess the possible presence of further depressive episodes and suicide attempts. Analysis was performed with SPSS.Results and discussionData collection are still ongoing; results and implications will be discussed. We expect to find higher attempted suicide rates in patients with lower resilience and less coping strategies.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
