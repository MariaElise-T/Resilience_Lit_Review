Abstract. Measuring urban resilience is one of the important processes toward understanding the current and potential future risk of cities to guide the development of suitable policies and strategies related to climate and disaster resilience. Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) is one of the means to measure urban resilience. CDRI has been adopted at international level and Kuala Lumpur was one of the tested cities. However, in this study the use of CDRI was adjusted by type of disaster, local needs, and the specific study objectives. A comprehensive assessment of all components that include the physical, social, economic, institutions and the environment component were performed to capture the current performance of the case study cities to cope with disasters. This paper aims at testing the CDRI and exploring the importance of measuring urban resilience to gain awareness on the current and potential future risk for better disaster risk management. Findings from the CDRI assessment performed on two cities; Kajang and Ampang Jaya, situated in the state of Selangor were presented. The paper also highlights the underlying factors that inhibit resilience and means on improving the future disaster management and planning of Malaysian cities to become a disaster resilient city. In conclusion, the data obtained from the CDRI assessment able to guide the establishment of Urban Resilience Action Plan for these cities.
