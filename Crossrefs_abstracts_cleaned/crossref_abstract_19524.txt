Much prior research has examined predictors of post-traumatic growth (PTG). However, less is known about information on predictors of stress-related growth (SRG). Thus, the current study aimed to examine the impacts of intra-personal factors (resilience, grit, distress tolerance) and organizational factors (organizational commitment, organizational identification) on SRG after military training. We used the data collected from 289 prospective cadets (men = 262, women = 27) who received basic military training for five weeks (mean age = 19.5 years). A hierarchical regression analysis showed that resilience was significantly associated with SRG, even after controlling the effect of perceived stress (β = .199, p < .01). However, grit and distress tolerance did not have differential impacts on SRG. In the final model including organizational variables, resilience still remained as a significant predictor (β = .144, p < .05). Organizational commitment (β = .447, p < .001) and identification (β = .118, p < .05) also showed positive impacts on SRG. These results imply that organizational commitment and identification as well as resilience as an intra-personal resource can be helpful for positive change after adversity in the military. Therefore, military leaders or policy makers should exert to improve soldiers' favorable attitudes or the sense of unity toward the military.
