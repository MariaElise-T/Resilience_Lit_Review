AbstractUnlike its inherent beneficial attributes, the blood supply chain is very complex due to its uncertain nature and irregular donation besides a high vulnerability to disruptions. In this regard, this study provides a multi‐objective integrated resilient‐efficient model to design a blood supply chain network under uncertainty. To evaluate the efficiency, an augmented form of the data envelopment analysis model is incorporated into the extended model. On the other hand, to improve supply chain resilience, different resiliency measures as optimization tools are introduced and inserted into the considered network. As blood donors have a main role in the blood supply chain, this paper undertakes motivational social aspects to stimulate blood donation for reducing possible shortages. Furthermore, to handle the multi‐objective problem, an interactive fuzzy approach is utilized. Finally, to indicate the applicability of the extended model and its solution approaches, a case study is provided considering realistic data. The results revealed that simultaneously considering all three measures of efficiency, resilience, and cost can assist in improvement of blood supply chain network design and a trade‐off among these three measures can be set by decision maker's preferences.
