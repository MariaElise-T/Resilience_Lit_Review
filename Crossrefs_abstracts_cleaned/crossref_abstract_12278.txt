AbstractKnowledge of how physiological responsivity and executive functioning relate to adaptation and resilience in early childhood has improved dramatically over the last decade, yet most studies focus on only one of these processes. By highlighting new findings and ongoing research, in this article, I advocate for investigating the dynamic interplay among physiological arousal, executive functions, and contextual experiences. New analytic approaches advance the conceptualization and measurement of physiological response as a process that comprises both reactivity and recovery. I also offer strategies for capturing complexities in contextual influences through examination of stimulating experiences, unique proximal and distal pathways, nonlinear effects, and longitudinal cascade models. This work can improve our understanding of how young children cope with stressors, engage with challenges, and achieve the optimal arousal and well‚Äêregulated behavior that supports development and learning.
