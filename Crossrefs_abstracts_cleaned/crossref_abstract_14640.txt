AbstractAn analysis of biomass and ground cover data collected from six rangeland sites in the Intermountain and Northern Great Plains areas of the United States from 2000 to 2004 was undertaken to characterize the productivity, stability, and resilience of cool‐season perennial grass species. Among the 13 included species, and the 48 cultivars, intermediate wheatgrass [Thinpyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey], tall wheatgrass [Thinpyrum elongatum (Host) D.R. Dewey], and to a lesser extent crested wheatgrass [Agropryon cristatum (L.) Gaertn. and A. desertorum (Fisch. ex Link) Schult.] possessed the greatest biomass productivity and ground cover. Basin wildrye [Leymus cinereus (Scribn. & Merr.) Á. Löve], thickspike wheatgrass [Elymus lanceolatus (Scribn. & J.G. Sm.) Gould], and bluebunch wheatgrass [Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve] were least productive and stable. There were no differences among species or cultivars for biomass resilience and differences for ground cover resilience were limited. Overall, these three statistics provide an interesting comparison among rangeland species, but more long‐term datasets are necessary for greater inferences and more definitive conclusions.
