AbstractThis paper extends resilience literature by empirically exploring the relationship between regional innovation performance and resistance and recovery aspects of regional labour resilience among NUTS 2 regions in the EU‐28 after great economic crisis in the last decade. The results of a multinomial logit regression model indicate differentiated effect of innovation performance with respect to different phases of resilience. Empirical findings clearly point out a very heterogeneous resilience path among EU regions offering evidence that a region‐tailored innovation approach embodied in the smart specialization strategy is vital for achieving higher labour resilience during (resistance phase) and immediately after (recovery phase) an external shock.
