AbstractManaging contradictions and building resilience help us overcome life's challenges. Here, we explored the link between attitudes towards contradictions and psychological resilience, examining the role of cortical conflict resolution networks. We enlisted 173 healthy young adults and used questionnaires to evaluate their cognitive thinking styles and resilience. They underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Our results revealed that contrasting attitudes toward contradictions, formal logic, and na√Øve dialecticism thinking styles corresponded with varying degrees of resilience. We noted structural and functional differences in brain networks related to conflict resolution, including the inferior frontal and parietal cortices. The volumetric variations within cortical networks indicated right-hemispheric lateralization in different thinking styles. These findings highlight the potential links between conflict resolution and resilience in the frontoparietal network. We underscore the importance of frontoparietal brain networks for executive control in resolving conflicting information and regulating the impact of contradictions on psychological resilience.
