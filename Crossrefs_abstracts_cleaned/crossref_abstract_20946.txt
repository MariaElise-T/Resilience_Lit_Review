Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the status of self-efficacy, resilience, personality traits, and job burnout of grassroots civil servants, and their relationship.


Methods
Grassroots civil servants were randomly selected, and questionnaire survey method was adopted.


Results
Civil servants with characteristics such as age, marital status, education level, and length of service were more prone to job burnout. Self-efficacy, resilience, and personality traits were important factors influencing job burnout of grassroots civil servants. Neuroticism played a regulating role in the relationship between self-efficacy and mental resilience. The increase of neuroticism score led to increasing mediation of self-efficacy on job burnout through decreased mental resilience.


Conclusions
Higher levels of self-efficacy and mental resilience may reduce job burnout. Higher levels of neuroticism have a negative effect on the moderating role of self-efficacy on job burnout through psychological resilience.
