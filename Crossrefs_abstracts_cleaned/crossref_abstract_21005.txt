Affected, like most countries in the world, by the covid-19 pandemic which has affected all sectors of activity, Morocco has proposed, as part of a policy of prevention and anticipation.The measures including the objective is not only to limit the spread of covid but also and above all to ensure educational continuity and the transition from face-to-face teaching to distance learning. However, not having, like the majority of countries, a prior strategy to deal with this disaster situation, the concept of the resilience of education systems was not yet included in public policies. This fact did not prevent the Moroccan government from deploying all the necessary means to ensure and maintain this educational continuity. Our subject, in this communication, would be focused, on the one hand, on the various actions carried out by the Moroccan government in times of covid and, on the other hand, on the measures adopted by the Moroccan university, through the Commission of the Presidents of Universities (CPU) to deal with this pandemic through management, courses and exams. We will focus on distance education in the Moroccan university, starting not only from our personal experience, since we have experienced this situation, but also from the scientific studies carried out by Moroccan colleagues during this period. The aim is to provide some answers to the following questions: a- What is the impact of preventive measures in terms of distance education on the academic year? b- What are the points of view of the student and the teacher with regard to this new university practice? c- What use and what contribution of ICT in the development of teaching practices?
