AbstractPurposeVarious physiological and psychological negative situations experienced by nurses as a result of COVID-19 pandemic have been shown to increase their perception of organizational difficulty and decrease their career commitment, thereby accelerating the turnover rate of nurses. Resilience and career adaptability have important influences on career commitment, so there is a need to evaluate the relationships between them and the underlying mechanisms.Patients and methodsUsing a cross-lagged design, the Career Adaptability Scale, the Chinese version of career commitment, and Davidsonâ€™s Resilience Scale as research methods, we studied 692 nursing students for two consecutive years to evaluate the relationship among career adaptability, resilience, and career commitment.ResultsCareer adaptability at T1 substantially and positively predicts the career commitment at T2. Career adaptability and resilience are mutually predictive. No interaction is found between resilience and career commitment over time. There is a substantial difference in the cross-lagged relationship among career adaptability, resilience, and career commitment for low- and high-career interest.ConclusionOur results show the importance of developing career commitment early on. Developing career adaptability, enhancing resilience, and increasing career interest in nursing students might help to increase career commitment.
