The field of cyber security is characterized by its diverse range of techniques, tools, and concepts, and it is closely interconnected with the security of information and operational technology. The distinguishing characteristic of cyber security is in the adoption of offensive information technology strategies with the intention of achieving adversarial objectives. Nevertheless, the broad and unrestricted utilization of the word "cyber security," frequently used interchangeably with information security or IT security, has the potential to create misunderstandings among both consumers and professionals in the security field. The merging of these disciplines obscures important differences between them, notwithstanding their interconnectedness.
This paper advocates for a significant suggestion aimed at security leaders: to limit the usage of the word "cyber security" to refer specifically to security practices that are closely intertwined with and dependent on information technology and operational technology environments and systems, solely for defensive objectives. In the context of computer network security, cyber defense plays a crucial role as a mechanism that addresses adversary acts, protects key infrastructure, and ensures information assurance for a wide range of enterprises, government agencies, and interconnected networks [3].
This study primarily examines the interplay between cyber security and cyber defense, emphasizing the development of the notion of cyber resilience. This paper presents a new conceptual framework for understanding cyber resilience, shedding light on the complex interplay between these several domains. Furthermore, in this model, the authors critically examine the tactics and measures necessary to enhance the resilience of cyber security and cyber defense in the face of escalating cyber threats. The article examines CRRT and MACS history, purpose, and future directions. At EU level, through the policy of innovation there is opportunity for more robust resilience and joint defense against ever-changing landscape of threat.
