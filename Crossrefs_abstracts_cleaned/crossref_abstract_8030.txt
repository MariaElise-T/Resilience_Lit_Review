Objective: This descriptive and correlational study was performed to determine the relationship between resilience and burnout levels of nurses working in psychiatry clinics.Methods: The population of this correlational study comprised 70 nurses, 55 of which constituted the study sampling between February and May in 2018. Research data was collected by means of “Personal Information Form”, “Psychological Resilience Scale/PRS” and “Maslach Burnout Scale/MBS”.Results: “Devotion” subscale of PRS showed a strong statistically significant inverse relationship with “Emotional Burnout” subscale of MBS (r=-0.707; p=0.000) albeit a moderate statistically significant inverse relationship noted with both “Desensitization” and “Personal Success” subscales of MBS (p&lt;0.05).Conclusion: The results of this study may help nurse managers and hospital administrators to have a better understanding of nurses’ burnout and resilience levels. Future studies on the determination of compassion fatigue, which is an expression of empathy fatigue against nurses in psychiatric clinics and particularly Community Mental Health Services, are highly recommended.
