For centuries, authorities have been patriarchal and vertical, following the law of the strongest in a binary vision of world, life and human being. If limitless and unquestionable, authority inevitably collapses into abuse and destruction. Facing the danger of authoritarianism, the democratic society moves to develop more humanistic organisation by exploring the possibilities of the distributed leadership. Art offers a specifically deep response to inner and outer conflicts. Based on the creative process, arts therapies address either individual and community violence and dictatorship. When the therapeutic relationship is collaborative and inclusive, art therapy contributes to the evolution of current forms of authority to new ones. Resisting and preventing power abuse is a main object if in therapy and education. Art and art therapy use positive anger to help treating trauma, enhance resilience and globally support mental and physical health.
