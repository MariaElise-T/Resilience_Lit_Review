This paper proposes a screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme via learned invariant keypoints and QT; that is, if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and captured by a camera, the watermark can be still extracted from the photo. A screen-shooting resilient watermarking algorithm should meet the following two basic requirements: robust keypoints and a robust watermark algorithm. In our case, we embedded watermarks by combining the feature region filtering model to SuperPoint (FRFS) neural networks, quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT), and tensor decomposition (TD). First we applied FRFS to locate the embedding feature regions which are decided by the keypoints that survive screen-shooting. Second, we structured watermark embedding regions centered at keypoints. Third, the watermarks were embedded by the QDFT and TD (QT) algorithm, which is robust for capturing process attacks. In a partial shooting scenario, the watermark is repeatedly embedded into different regions in an image to enhance robustness. Finally, we extracted the watermarks from at least one region at the extraction stage. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme is very robust for camera shooting (including partial shooting) different shooting scenarios, and special attacks. Moreover, the efficient mechanism of screen-shooting resilient watermarking could have propietary protection and leak tracing applications.
