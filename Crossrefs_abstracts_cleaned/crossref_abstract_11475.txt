Abstract
When the power grid faces sudden extreme events, large-scale blackouts have caused huge economic losses. At the same time, under the development of smart grid, the research of resilient distribution network has received more extensive attention. This article introduces the connotations and concepts of resilient distribution networks in the context of smart grids, and expands the connotations of resilient grids. In addition to the resilience of physical strength under extreme disasters, it also proposes market resilience under the laws of market economy and normal operation mode. This article also introduces several key technologies for improving the resilience of power grids, including intelligent self-sensing power reserve system, adjustable flexible load, source-grid-load-storage coordinated control system, online intelligent diagnosis of power cables, and Operation and maintenance, describes the principles and functions of these technologies in building resilient power grids. The article describes from the perspectives of prevention before disasters and recovery when disasters occur.
