Aims: The Purpose of the current study was to compare personality traits of high school female students based on their Resilience level..
Place and Duration of Study: Government Girls Senior Secondary School No1 JJColony Bawana, Delhi, India, on 3rd Feb 2020.
Methodology: This is a comparative study with a quantitative research design involving 85 (eighty-five) female students, age ranges between 16-18 years (mean age 17.43 years) studying in class XII (humanities stream), from Sec- A, B and C from Government Girls Senior Secondary School No. 1 JJColony Bawana, Delhi were randomly selected as a sample of research. Every odd roll no student (Roll no. 1,3,5,7…) from Sec- A, B and C from GGSSS No. 1 JJC Bawana, Delhi were randomly selected as a sample of research. The standardized questionnaires of the Big Five Personality Test and Ego Resilience Scale were used as the tool of the study. The data was collected using both the questionnaires and interpreted using an Independent sample t-test at a significance level p<0.05.
Results: All 85 high school female students filled both of the questionnaires and in accordance with the findings of the analysis it was established that the average scores of resilient students in the extroversion (t (83)= 6.28, P=.00), openness to experience (t(83)=8.54, P=.00), agreeableness (t(83)=10.48, P=.00) and conscientiousness (t(83)=11.34, P=.00) were higher than non-resilient students. Just the mean scores of resilient students in neuroticism (t(83)= -6.71, P=.00) were lower than the mean scores of non-resilient students. 
Conclusion: It is evident from the results that students with high Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience personality traits have higher resilience which helps them to recover from any obstacle and support them to approach new circumstances, people, or experiences with a positive mindset and confidence which ultimately will help them succeed.
