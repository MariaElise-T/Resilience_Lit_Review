The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected businesses, particularly micro, small, and medium enterprises. In the Philippines, over 70% of MSMEs have experienced cash flow problems which resulted in layoffs, temporary shutdowns, or worst, permanent closure. This experience served as an eye-opener for entrepreneurs engaged even policymakers to make business pandemic-proof or resilient. One sector that is affected severely is pet care services. During the early months of the pandemic, pet care services temporarily closed in compliance with Philippine government regulations.  While some managed to resume their operations gradually, around 70% failed to recover and decided to close their business pet care shops indefinitely. This study aims to propose a hypothesized model that shows the different factors that affect business resiliency using a systematic literature review. The results of this exploratory study will be used as a basis for a quantitative study that will measure the relationship between the variables identified in the literature review.
