Military to civilian reintegration is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon warranting holistic perspectives. Complex phenomena require theory to understand and interpret relationships among concepts. Despite the need for theory-driven research, recent nursing reports often lack a theoretical structure. We extracted relevant concepts from the Neuman's Systems Model (stressors, environment, and person) and the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (primary and secondary appraisal, coping, and adaptation) to form a Conceptual-Theoretical-Empirical model. Exemplar empirical instruments are presented, along with their conceptual and theoretical dimensions. An integrated System Theory of Stress, Resilience, and Reintegration is presented with its utility demonstrated through a research application.
