The purpose of this study is to discuss ways to overcome the hikikomori phenomenon, a reclusive loner, through the Japanese film <Tomako in Moratorium> directed by Yamashita Nobuhiro (山下敦弘) released in 2013. Characteristics of hikikomori are dreamer temperament, escapism, and double appearance. Hikikomori shows a state of maladjustment in reality, with a tendency to identify imaginary images with reality. The gap between the ideal and the reality of hikikomori works as a factor that makes social adaptation difficult while generating cognitive dissonance.
Basically, hikikomori shows fear of society or loss of confidence. Hikikomori fail to form bonds with others and experience wounds as people, entering their own world and living an isolated life. Hikikomori needs a period of recovery to become normal. This process can be defined as resilience, and the expression of interest and love between family members can have a direct impact.
The female protagonist of this movie shows herself living a meaningless daily life without hope. In particular, this movie takes the attitude of calmly conveying the frustrating and helpless reality of young people from an objective standpoint and does not scold them. This is because the appearance of helpless young people is not arbitrary, but rather a result of issues of social responsibility or structure. The movie presents that the helpless heroine's daily life was a fierce inner struggle as she prepares step by step for her positive future. In conclusion, rather than unilaterally criticizing helpless young people, society and the older generation need to be more relaxed and interested in helping them develop resilience.
