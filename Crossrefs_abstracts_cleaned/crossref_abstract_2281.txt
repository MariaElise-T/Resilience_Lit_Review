Warm-Mix-Asphalt (WMA) allows aggregates to be coated with asphalt binder at a temperature lower than the Hot-Mix-Asphalt (HMA) temperatures by using additives that make the asphalt mixtures more workable and the asphalt binder viscosity reduced. Due to the cost and environmental advantages of WMA, it is now more frequently employed in the mixtures of asphalt pavement. WMA with two percentages of zeolite (0.3% and 0.5%) is used in this research. The optimum asphalt content of WMA mixtures has a lower value compared to the HMA mixture. According to Marshall Stabilityâ€™s findings, the HMA has a higher value of stability, whereas the WMA mixtures for both percentages of zeolite have a lower value of stability. WMA mixture with 0.5% zeolite has a higher Marshall Flow value, which is followed by zeolite at 0.3% and the lower value of flow was for HMA. The resilient modulus for both HMA and WMA was determined. The findings indicate that, for the two percentages of zeolite, the resilience modulus of the WMA mixtures was lower than that of the HMA. Additionally, the findings indicate that the WMA has a high potential resistance against rutting that competes with the HMA mixture.
