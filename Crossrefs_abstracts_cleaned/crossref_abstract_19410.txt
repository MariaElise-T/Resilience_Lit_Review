Abstract. Urban farming is recently acknowledged as a strategy with various services in improving cities resilience but facing cons such as land competition and rapid urbanization. The study attempts to inventory available areas for urban farming implementation and estimate the total values with case study in Malang city, Indonesia. The study divided urban farming into five forms i.e. nursery, allotment, residential, institutional and rooftop farming based on its characteristics. Land inventory has been done by estimating existing and potential areas. Existing area was manually delineated by Field Area Measure App through field visit and visualized by ArcGIS. Potential area was identified through geospatial assessment considering land use and land cover map provided by the Government of Indonesia and parcel zoning based on Guideline of Urban Farming development and literatures. The study employed Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and Market Price Method to estimate total values of urban farming. Currently there is 1.38 ha of urban farming which is equal to 0.01 % of city’s area distributed in 21 plots and 211.46 ha potential area or equal to 1.92 % of city’s area. Urban farming has services for amount of US$ 28.68 m−2 yr−1, specifically 22.86, 3.60, 0.80, 1.10 and 0.34 US$ m−2 yr−1 in terms of provisioning food; income generation; recreation and community building; education and learning; and maintenance urban comfort, respectively. If existing and potential area used for urban farming, then it could contribute to US$ 395,095.68 annually for existing and potentially up to US$ 60,646,800.35 annually for entire city.
