This study examines the relationship between gratitude, resilience, and academic performance among students of a public university in Malaysia. One hundred and forty-six samples were obtained through a simple random technique (N=235). The survey employed GQ6 (Gratitude Questionnaire), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and self-reported grade-point average (GPA) as its measurement tools. Correlation analysis shows that gratitude has a high positive relationship with resilience and academic performance. Findings from the study support those of previous studies about the importance of gratitude in improving studentâ€™s psychological resilience and academic performances. The study suggests that adopting a sense of gratefulness and appreciation helps students overcome challenges in their educational journey at university.
