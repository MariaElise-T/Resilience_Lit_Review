Segurança Social (Portugal's Social Security System) offers multiple service channels to the people. However, they were not perceived as a whole because the assistance was not standard, depending on the channel or person answering—leading to cumulative problems that could take months to resolve.We faced the complex nature of a big governmental organization. Our research made us more aware of people's general reluctance towards public institutions as they tend to expect poor quality service. We used the information from field research to create four prototypes that would bring tangible results to citizens and impact the institution's culture in the long term.Segurança Social has always been about resilience: the organization itself and the people it serves. Despite its flaws and fragilities, it's the social system that allows many to thrive. That's why we envisioned the system's sustainability, rooted in the workers' resilience and processes.
