AimResilience is seen as a vital resource for coping and mental health in adolescents. However, there is no universally accepted theory or definition of resilience, leading to considerable challenges regarding how to operationalise and measure this construct. The study aimed at providing further knowledge of the psychometric properties (dimensionality, construct validity and internal consistency) of the 28‐item version of the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) in N = 1183 Norwegian adolescents, 13–18 years old.MethodsDimensionality of READ was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Convergent validity and reliability were tested using Pearson's correlation analysis, Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability.ResultsThe CFA supported a modified, 20‐item, five‐factor structure with high reliability, supporting the dimensionality and internal consistency of the instrument. Convergent validity was confirmed where all factors correlated in expected directions with measures of sense of coherence, self‐esteem, stress and depression.ConclusionThe psychometric properties of the READ need to be further evaluated in adolescents; however, the results indicate that a modified 20‐item version of READ is adequate for assessing resilience in the present sample of Norwegian adolescents.
