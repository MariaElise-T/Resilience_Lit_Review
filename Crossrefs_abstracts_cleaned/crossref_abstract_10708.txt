While the topic of mental health has received growing attention among athletes, coaches’ mental health has not been addressed enough. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the roles that individual (i.e., age, gender, level of qualification, and resilience) and environmental characteristics (i.e., social support) play in aspects of mental illness and mental health among Estonian coaches. A web-based survey was conducted among Estonian coaches which resulted in 182 participants (95 females). The holistic survey included information about the study, a set of demographic questions, and self-reported scales about aspects of mental illnesses and mental health and possible protective factors (i.e., resilience and social support). Results showed that lower resilience predicted higher Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Emotional State Questionnaire-2 (EST-Q2) subscale Depression and Anxiety scores. Resilience and social support were positively correlated. Age was negatively associated with PSS, and EST-Q2 subscale Depression and Anxiety scores. Females’ scores were higher than males’ in PSS and EST-Q2 Anxiety subscale. Path analysis confirmed that the best predictor for PSS and EST-Q2 Depression and Anxiety subscale scores was resilience. Based on the findings, practical recommendations are provided on how to better support coaches.
