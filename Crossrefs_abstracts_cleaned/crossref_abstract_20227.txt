Mining is an important industry in Indonesia. A nickel mining company has operated for almost 45 years. It has managed corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes in the neighbouring local community. In addition to the environmental conservation and mitigation, as well as socioeconomic enhancement, the CSR is expected to nurture resilience in the local communities. This study’s goal is to examine the effect of CSR on community resilience (COM-R) in the surrounding community. To analyse the effect of CSR practise on COM-R, Partial Least Squares -Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) is used. Results show that CSR has a positive effect on and a significant relationship with COM-R. Results also indicate that CSR’s contribution to COM-R enhances community collective efficacy, community action, and adaptation. Thus, the verified CSR and COM-R model benefits other researchers, companies, and governments to be further explored.
