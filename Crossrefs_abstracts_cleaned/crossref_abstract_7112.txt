AbstractMillets are known for their resilience and nutritional benefits and hence believed to have a promising role in ensuring food and nutritional security under changing climatic conditions. Research on millets has intensified in recent years, especially in dissecting the genetic components of yield, stress tolerance and nutritional quality traits. Recent advances in next‐generation sequencing, bioinformatics and associated statistical procedures for genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have provided wide opportunities to resolve the genetic complexity of polygenic traits by measuring historical and evolutionary recombination events in the natural population(s). During the past decade, GWAS has been successfully employed to identify key genes controlling growth, development, stress tolerance, nutrient use efficiency and nutritional quality traits in sorghum, pearl millet, foxtail millet and finger millet. However, progress in other minor millets is still in its infancy. Genetic dissection of these complex traits in millets may pave the way for genetic alteration of climate resilience, photosynthesis and nutrient accumulation in rice and wheat. In this review, progress in GWAS analysis in detecting QTLs underlying complex traits in sorghum and other millets is highlighted.
