Industrialization and urbanization have affected Indonesia’s rural communities and farming culture, which were once integral parts of its ecological system. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach based on the local and traditional learning philosophy of niteni to support sustainable development. The participatory co-design approach encouraged collaboration between marginalized communities, government bodies, and a multidisciplinary academic team. Through this lens, interviews, forums, and an ethnographic study were undertaken in order to acquire data and information for idea generation and planning. Firstly, eight niteni themes were identified, including the environment and ecosystems, traditional values and farming culture, crafting skills, manufacturing, and the local economy. Building on an understanding of the challenges associated with each of these themes, we identified future development priorities. A key action identified was the reintroduction of traditional farming, in particular the planting of local rice varieties and the local tradition of Pranatamangsa, which promote human–nature connections such as farming activities and rituals following natural seasonal cycles. Finally, design approaches were used to revive the local rice farming tradition (Rojolele Delanggu), including product branding and packaging designs to support regional identity. The paper concludes that the inclusion of design thinking in a sustainable development strategy based on cultural specificity can increase participation and support traditional indigenous practices and community resiliency.
