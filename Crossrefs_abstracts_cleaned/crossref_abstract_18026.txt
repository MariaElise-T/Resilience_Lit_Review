Abstract:  To test whether the development of emotional resilience is a function of sensitive caregiving and child negative affect, we tested the joint contributions of 7‐month maternal sensitivity and infant negative affect to the prediction of 33‐month emotional resilience across the first 3 years of life. The aims of this study were to examine whether maternal sensitivity and infant negative affect predict long‐term emotional resilience and whether this was associated with preschool behavior problems. Using a sample of 181 mother–infant dyads, we found that (a) maternal sensitivity at 7 months, but not infant negative affect, longitudinally predicted emotional resilience during preschool and (b) emotional resilience was negatively associated with anxiety/depression in preschool.
