Though multilevel, in-depth information protection systems are employed to defend against unknown cyber threats, vulnerabilities in these systems are frequently exploited by cyberattacks. As a result, it becomes challenging to comprehensively counter these attacks within a constrained time frame. When a cyberattack is detected, immediate measures are necessary to prevent widespread damage and maintain the system’s regular functioning. Possessing sustainable cyber-resilience capabilities, which can promptly restore the system to its pre-attack state, is crucial. In this paper, a cyber-defense activity optimization procedure is introduced, drawing on the failure recovery time of the information system, aiming to enhance both the response and recovery phases of cyber resilience. Through training, the response time for various types of cyberattack was determined. Notably, a decrease in response time by 17.8% compared to the baseline was observed. By optimizing response times and integrating them with sustainable cyber-resilience assessment activities, a robust framework is presented for evaluating an organization’s overall cyber-defense stance. Research on the cyber combat capability index, dissecting the response time for each distinct cyber-defense activity, is planned for future endeavors.
