AbstractThe main objective of this study was to assess the microbiota diversity in milk samples collected from Holstein cows with different estimated breeding values for predicted feed efficiency, milk coagulation, resilience to mastitis, and consequently, to study its effects on milk quality. One hundred and twenty milk samples were collected in two seasons (summer and winter) from different commercial dairy farms in the Nord-east of Italy. For each trait, 20 animals divided into two groups of the high (10 cows) and the low (10 cows) were selected to study the microbiota profile using 16S rRNA metabarcoding sequencing. The alpha and beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences between the high and the low groups for feed efficiency and resilience to mastitis, while no significant difference was detected for milk coagulation. Moreover, remarkable differences among the taxa were detected between the two seasons, where the winter was more diverse than summer when applied the Chao1 index. Lastly, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) indicated Aerococcus, Corynebacterium, Facklamia, and Psychrobacter taxa with more abundance in the high group of feed efficiency, whereas, in resilience to mastitis, only two genera of Mycoplana and Rhodococcus were more abundant in the low group. In addition, LEfSe analysis between the seasons showed significant differences in the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas. These findings indicate that the different genetic predisposition for feed efficiency and resilience to mastitis could affect the raw milk microbiota and, consequently, its quality. Moreover, we found more abundance of mastitis-associated bacteria in the milk of dairy cows with a higher feed efficiency index.
