Acoustical biophysical therapies, including ultrasound, radial pressure waves, and shockwaves, have been shown to harbor both a destructive and regenerative potential depending on physical treatment parameters. Despite the clinical relevance of fungal biofilms, little work exits comparing the efficacy of these modalities on the destruction of fungal biofilms. This study evaluates the impact of acoustical low-frequency ultrasound, radial pressure waves, and shockwaves on the viability and proliferation of in vitro Rhizopus oryzae biofilm under Amphotericin B induced apoptosis. In addition, the impact of a fibrin substrate in comparison with a traditional polystyrene well-plate one is explored. We found consistent, mechanically promoted increased Amphotericin B efficacy when treating the biofilm in conjunction with low frequency ultrasound and radial pressure waves. In contrast, shockwave induced effects of mechanotransduction results in a stronger resilience of the biofilm, which was evident by a marked increase in cellular viability, and was not observed in the other types of acoustical pressure waves. Our findings suggest that fungal biofilms not only provide another model for mechanistical investigations of the regenerative properties of shockwave therapies, but warrant future investigations into the clinical viability of the therapy.
