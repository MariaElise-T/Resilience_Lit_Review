AbstractAdvance care planning (ACP) is essential for end-of-life care, especially during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and resilience is critical to deal with pandemic-related stressors. Therefore, we investigated the association between resilience ability and ACP discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationwide web-based survey was conducted in July 2021 in Japan. We analyzed the respondents’ ability to bounce back from stress (bouncing-back ability), positive stress coping (e.g., “seeking social support”, “planning”), and negative stress coping (e.g., “avoidance”, “alcohol and drug use”) in relation to ACP discussions using multivariable logistic regression models. In total, 2000 responses (86% participation rate) were received (mean age: 51.8 ± 16.7). Normal and high bouncing-back ability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.03–2.79; AOR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.18–3.65, respectively) were significantly associated with the occurrence of ACP discussions. Seeking social support and planning were significantly associated with ACP discussions, whereas avoidance and alcohol and drug use were not. Both bouncing-back ability and positive stress coping were significantly associated with the occurrence of ACP discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. These findings could be useful for aiding health-care providers involved in ACP discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
