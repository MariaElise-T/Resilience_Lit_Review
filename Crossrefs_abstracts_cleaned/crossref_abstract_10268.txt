Abstract:  Much resilience research has focused on childhood, despite a growing understanding that resilience is a lifelong process. Adulthood is characterized by turning points that might support a movement toward resilience; yet, such opportunities are not evenly distributed across social class and geographic location. Employing a life course perspective, we examined the pathways of 8 mothers within the context of 3 rural trailer parks to understand how they managed a trajectory toward resilience. Multiple turning points throughout the life course focused on building support, and distancing from nonsupportive influences emerged as particularly salient. The persistence of economic hardships and limited social support, however, continued to present significant and daily challenges to navigating resilient pathways. Policy and program implications are discussed.
