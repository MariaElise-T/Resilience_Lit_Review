Plant growth regulators control various physiological processes in plants, including growth and development. Among these regulators, brassinosteroids (BRs) have emerged as important phytohormones with diverse roles in crop development and metabolism. They influence processes like cell division, elongation, reproduction, flowering, vascular differentiation, fruit ripening, root formation, and responses to both biotic and abiotic stressors. Additionally, BRs enhance tolerance and resilience to these stressors. Their impact on fruit trees' defense mechanisms holds significant potential for the fruit industry. This review focuses on the wide-ranging physiological and economic importance of BRs in modern fruit production, highlighting their applications and implications through conceptual research and development efforts.
