 The purpose of the study in this article was to replicate past findings showing the effectiveness of a cognitive, behavioral resilience-building/anxiety-prevention program, “FRIENDS for Life.” The results of the controlled study of two Grade 4 classrooms in Canada (N = 52) indicate that all children reported reduced levels of anxiety regardless of receiving the FRIENDS program. Limitations of the study are discussed and future research concerning school counseling programs using evidence-based approaches is highlighted.
