The purpose of the study is to assess and analyze the resilience of the economic development of Russian regions. Based on five main development indicators, using the Mahalanobis distance technique to design a composite index, constructing its temporal regressions and separating the trend component from the cyclical component, assessments of the level of development instability in 83 Russian regions in 2000-2017 are obtained. The hypotheses about the positive relationship of development instability with the level and rate of regional development, and about the negative relationship of instability with the level of sectoral diversification of the economy are confirmed.
