Abstract
In this article, the authors relate the life of Chris through narrative snapshots. Chris asked the authors to tell her story. They decided that it could be used to provide an insight into the different ways people with labels are confronted with professional practices and rituals.
Although Chris lived a “tough life,” her story is full of resilience and resistance. Chris will be kept in the authors' memory as a strong woman, a teacher, and a friend.
