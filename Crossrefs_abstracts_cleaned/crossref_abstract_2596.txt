Nowadays, due to the increasing number of disasters, improving distribution system resiliency is a new challenging issue for researchers. One of the main methods for improving the resiliency in distribution systems is to supply critical loads after disasters during the power outage and before system restorations. In this paper, a “Sustainable and resilient smart house” is introduced for the first time by using plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs have the ability to use their fuel for generating electricity in emergency situations as the Vehicle to Grid (V2G) scheme. This ability, besides smart house control management, provides an opportunity for distribution system operators to use their extra energy for supplying a critical load in the system. The proposed control strategy in this paper is dedicated to a short duration power outage, which includes a large percent of the events. Then, improvement of the resiliency of distribution systems is investigated through supplying smart residential customers and injecting extra power to the main grid. A novel formulation is proposed for increasing the injected power of the smart house to the main grid using PHEVs. The effectiveness of the proposed method in increasing power injection during power outages is shown in simulation results.
