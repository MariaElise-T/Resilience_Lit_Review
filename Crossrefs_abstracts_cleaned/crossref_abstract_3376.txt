Food insecurity remains a threat to Nigerians especially agricultural households who are the most vulnerable. This study focuses on the structure of the resilience of agricultural households to food insecurity in Nigeria using the World Bank‘s Living Standard Measurement Studies Integrated Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), covering four rounds (2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2015/2016 and 2018/2019) using a total of 4975, 4394, 4226 and 4797 households respectively. Data were analysed using Descriptive Statistics, Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes Model and the Random Effects Probit model. The pillars of resilience to food insecurity among agricultural households include access to basic services, asset, agricultural practice and technology, social safety net, adaptive capacity and stability. Results showed that only about 34% of households were resilient to food insecurity during the periods under review. The most essential determinants affecting food insecurity resilience are access to basic services, assets, stability, adaptive capacity and social safety net. Age of household head, livelihood strategy employed, geo-political zones and location of residence significantly influence food insecurity resilience of households. Farmers’ income and food access must be improved as well as their adaptive capacity to food insecurity in order to help them become more resilient to food insecurity and inevitably help in achieving the Sustainable Development goal two of ending hunger in all its forms and improving food security which is one of the main policy thrust of the Nigeria’s economic and sustainability plan and the National Development Plan.
