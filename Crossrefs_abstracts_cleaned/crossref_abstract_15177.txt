Human reliability is one of the most important factors that make effects in nuclear power plant(NPP) operation. In advanced digital NPP main control room with high levels of automation, the systematic operation which require a sufficient mental workload to address those undesired events has become a critical challenge for operators. The aim of this research is to identify the operator’s reliability by developing a resilience model. In this work, a seven-stage technique framework is proposed, which includes the skeleton of theoretical analysis, experimental design and hardware setting to how to establish the model for NPP operator in a downsize main control room cabin. The resilience model for operators’ reliability via assessing their basic skill tasks performance and evaluating their cognitive workload in the framework hence can be used for assessing the level of training of the new employed operators as well as human reliability in other critical process industries.
