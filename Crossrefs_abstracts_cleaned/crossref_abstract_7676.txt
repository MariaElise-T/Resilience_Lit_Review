To objectively grasp the current situation and development trend of resilient cities or communities (RC) research. The articles in Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection databases from 1995 to 2022 were used as a sample, and bibliometrics was used to statistically analyze the year of publication and number of articles, highly cited documents and keyword hotness in this field. VOSviewer was used to explore the knowledge graph of RC research documents. The results show that: the development process is roughly divided into 3 periods: no attention (1995–2004), starting (2005–2014), and rapid growth (2015–2021). The journal “Sustainability” and “International journal of disaster risk reduction” are the key journals publishing RC research. Serre and Shaw are the most productive authors. The USA is still the leading country in this field of RC. Colorado State Univ, Texas a&m Univ, and Delft Univ Technol are the main research institutions. The keyword analysis indicates the hot topics in different periods. Moreover, several limitations and some recommendations for future research on RC are also given based on this.
