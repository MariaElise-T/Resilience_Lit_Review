Global cities in the context of accelerated urbanization have to deal with more diverse risk factors than ever before, which highlights the need for a faster and more creative response capacity. Although it is necessary to strengthen technical systems, since they are surrounded by human systems, individual resilience will help to strengthen the community. The educational system is key to developing the human factor in a world where various systems in global cities are increasingly interconnected, which in turn increases risks. Japan is fostering a culture of disaster risk reduction in both the formal, non-formal, and informal education sectors, in which creativity and autonomy are key competencies. Tokyo is the highest populated metropolitan area globally, and its educational system is the international model for education in disaster risk reduction. Urban areas around the world face similar challenges and experience similar needs. This article addresses the challenges that the human factor faces in large cities and the possibilities of increasing resilience in both individuals and communities through Disaster Resilience Education (DRE), taking the Japanese educational system as a model.
