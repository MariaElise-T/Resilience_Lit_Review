OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to determine relationships between moral injury (MI), well-being, and resilience among staff nurses and nurse leaders practicing during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.


BACKGROUND
Attention to MI among health professionals, including nurses, increased in 2021, particularly related to the pandemic. Few studies examined MI, well-being, and resilience; even fewer provided implications for leadership/management.


METHODS
The sample included 676 RNs practicing in Ohio. The electronic survey included assessments of MI, well-being, and resilience distributed via the Ohio Nurses Association and the schools of nursing alumni Listservs.


RESULTS
There was a significant association between MI and negative well-being and negative association between MI and resilience. Differences were observed between staff nurses and leaders.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study relating MI, resilience, and well-bring among nurses and nurse leaders during the pandemic. There is a need for additional research to further our understanding about nurses' health and well-being during the pandemic and beyond.
