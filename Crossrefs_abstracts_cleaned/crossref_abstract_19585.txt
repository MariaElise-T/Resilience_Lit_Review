AbstractThis study investigated the resilience resources and coping profiles of patients with diabetes. A total of 145 patients with diabetes completed a questionnaire packet including two measurements of coping (COPE and Coping Styles Questionnaires) and personal resources. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also assessed. Resilience was defined by a factor score derived from measures of self‐esteem, self‐efficacy, self‐mastery and optimism. All of the maladaptive coping subscales were negatively associated with resilience (r's range from −0.34 to −0.56, all p values are <0.001). Of the adaptive coping subscales, only acceptance, emotional support and pragmatism were positively associated with resilience. The upper, middle and lower tertiles of the resilience factor were identified, and the coping profiles of these groups differed significantly, with low‐resilience patients favouring maladaptive strategies much more than those with high‐ or moderate‐resilience resources do. Resilience groups did not differ in HbA1c levels; correlation coefficients of the coping subscales with HbA1c were explored. This study demonstrates a link between maladaptive coping and low resilience, suggesting that resilience impacts one's ability to manage the difficult treatment and lifestyle requirements of diabetes.
