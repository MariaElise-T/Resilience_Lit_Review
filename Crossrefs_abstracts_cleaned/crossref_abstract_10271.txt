Climate change continues to be a global concern because of associated natural disasters and potential destructions and deaths of many. However, this concern has led to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to reduce climate hazards and disasters by 2030. One of the SDGs is disaster resilience, which is about mitigating the risk and increasing preparedness to handle any disaster with minimal casualties. Particularly, the committee on environmental and climate change sustainability has introduced the SDG target 13.1 that handles the resilience concept. The purpose of this research paper was to explore the role of Bangladesh youths in achieving target 13. 1. The researcher adopted a literature review to collect earlier scholars findings on the topic. In addition, qualitative research entailing in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted. The findings revealed that youths play a vital role in the achievement of SDGs, particularly target 13.1. Furthermore, Bangladesh has put commendable efforts to engage youth toward SDG achievement. The efforts are not exhaustive, thus, the research concluded with a recommendation that Bangladesh should expand youth engagement programs toward disaster resilience.
