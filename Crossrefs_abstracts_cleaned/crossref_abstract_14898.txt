AbstractAlthough stressful life events (SLEs) frequently relate to negative outcomes, many individuals demonstrate resilience by positively adapting to stressors without significant impairment. Valued living, a key process in the theory underpinning acceptance and commitment therapy is a response style characterized by daily purposeful actions that are linked to important values and may promote resilience in college students. This study examined the main and interactive effects of SLEs and valued living in the prediction of a multidimensional measure of resilience. Results supported a strong positive relationship between resilience and valued living. Further, valued living moderated the association between SLE negative impact scores and resilience (but not the association between cumulative prior year SLEs and resilience). Although SLE negative impact scores were negatively associated with resilience at lower levels of valued living, there was no demonstrated relationship at higher levels of valued living. Implications related to promoting valued living among college students in the service of increasing resilience are discussed.
