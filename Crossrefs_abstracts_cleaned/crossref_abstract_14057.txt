Abstract
Date Presented 04/19/21
This study surveyed 137 mothers to determine the predictors of resilience, maternal attachment, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) satisfaction postdischarge. Statistically significant predictors for NICU satisfaction were social support and maternal attachment; for resilience, maternal attachment and social support; and for maternal attachment, resilience, NICU satisfaction, and social support. It is important for OTs to understand these relationships to better support this population.
