Positive Plus One is a mixed-methods study of long-term mixed HIV-serostatus relationships in Canada (2016–19). Qualitative interviews with 51 participants (10 women, 41 men, including 27 HIV-positive and 24 HIV-negative partners) were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis to examine notions of relationship resilience in the context of emerging HIV social campaigns. Relationship resilience meant finding ways to build and enact life as a normal couple, that is, a couple not noticeably affected by HIV, linked to the partner with HIV maintaining viral suppression and achieving “undetectable = untransmittable” (U = U). Regardless of serostatus, participants with material resources, social networks, and specialized care were better able to construct resilience for HIV-related challenges within their relationships. Compared to heterosexual couples and those facing socioeconomic adversity, gay and bisexual couples were easier able to disclose, and access capital, networks and resources supporting resilience. We conclude that important pathways of constructing, shaping, and maintaining resilience were influenced by the timing of HIV diagnosis in the relationship, access to HIV-related information and services, disclosure, stigma and social acceptance.
