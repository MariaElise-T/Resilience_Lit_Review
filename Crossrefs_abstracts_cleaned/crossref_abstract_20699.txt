In order to focus on the mission and functions of the business of the organizations, cyber resiliency have to play a critical role against the adversariesâ€™ target. The strategy recommended by NIST to reduce the suspect ability of cyber-attacks of the system with the three dimensions such as harden the target, limit the damage to the target and make the target resilient. The threats could be based on cyber andnoncyber. The objective is to provide cyber resiliency on the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), has born with the nature of sophisticated, stealthy, persistent towards target and highly adoptable to the environment. The challenge is to provide cyber resilience to the system from compromising tactics of the adversaries, uncertain in eradication of threat due to its persistent nature, recognizing its adapting ability. The cyber resiliency also links with other disciplines like safety, fault tolerance, privacy, resilience and survivability, reliability and security.
