Objective:
This study aims to examine whether there are differences in symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, levels of burnout and resilience in Spanish healthcare staff between the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and after it, depending on several demographic and work-related variables.


Methods:
A longitudinal study was conducted in April 2020 (T0), and July 2020 (T1). Symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, burnout, levels of resilience, along with demographic and work-related variables in 443 workers were assessed.


Results:
Symptoms and burnout were more pronounced at T0, whereas the levels of resilience were higher at T1. Being women, being young, holding a lower-level job, less years of experience, lower educational level, and/or working rotating shifts are associated with having more posttraumatic stress symptoms and burnout.


Conclusion:
These variables would be considered in similar situations.
