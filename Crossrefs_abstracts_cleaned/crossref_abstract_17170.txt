AbstractRapid urbanisation in the Asia‐Pacific region is associated with complex changes to urban food environments. The impact of changing food environments on food purchasing and consumption and the diets and nutritional status of vulnerable groups, especially women and young children, is not well researched in low‐ and middle‐income country cities. This paper aimed to examine: the risks and opportunities for healthy diets for low income populations offered by modernising urban centres; the concept of food deserts in relation to urban food environments in the Asia‐Pacific region and how these could be mitigated; and measures to strengthen the resilience of food environments in the region using a case study of the impact of COVID‐19 on informal food vendors. Our findings indicate that the dynamic changes in urban food environments in the Asia‐ Pacific region need to be understood by examining not only modern retail food outlets but also wet markets and informal food outlets, including street foods. Efforts should be made to ensure both modern and traditional outlets provide complementary platforms for convenient, affordable and accessible nutritious foods for urban populations. The resilience of urban food environments to environmental, physical and socio‐economic shocks can be strengthened by shortening food supply chains and maximising food production in cities. Support mechanisms targeting urban informal food outlets and street vendors can also strengthen resilience and improve food security. Further research is needed on the impact of urbanising food environments on consumer choices, preferences, diets and health outcomes.
