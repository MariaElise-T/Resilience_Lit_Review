This study aims to elucidate child welfare workers’ resilience and coping styles. Data were collected via questionnaire, specifically the Resilience Scale (RS) and Coping Style Scales-Brief Form (CSS-BF). RS-based results indicated intermediate professional resilience ( n = 108) wherein professionals protect their resilience with training and peer support or coaching. Emotion-focused coping methods were also found to be effective. Using different methods than those used in this study, future research on professional resilience in other social work areas is recommended.
