Abstract
Mycobacterium avium subspecies paraturberculosis is the causative agent of Johneâ€™s disease, an enteritis infection that affects ruminants.This disease has been studied in deer, but there is little information regarding immunity or disease immunopathology. There is evidence that host genetics contribute to resilience or susceptibility to the disease. This study sought to identify genes in the innate and adaptive immune systems as biomarkers for resilient (R) or susceptible (S) phenotypes in red deer. We have bred over 60 animals from sires with a confirmed R or S phenotype. Animals were bled routinely and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) or whole PBMCs were obtained and cultured in vitro. Gene expression was determined using qPCR. The 15 most informative gene targets were chosen from a panel of 60 using GenEx software MDMs showed higher levels of expression of immune genes such as IL1A, TNFA, IL23A and IL12A in S animals, as well as genes not typically associated with the immune system, such as PKLR that exhibit this pattern. Conversely, PBMC samples from these animals exhibit higher levels of expression of immune genes such as IFNY, IL17A and IL2 in R animals. These results have been reproduced in animals bred from different sires over several years. We intend to incorporate these gene markers into diagnostic tests to identify R and S animals at an early age. These genes may also provide deeper insights into immune parameters that determine disease outcome in an animal.
