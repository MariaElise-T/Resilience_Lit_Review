In this paper, entropy, coupling coordination degree, spatial auto-analysis, LISA time path, and other methods have been used to analyze the coupling coordination degree of urban resilience and urbanization quality of 14 cities in Liaoning Province from 2009 to 2019. The results show that: 1. The number of highly resilient cities accounts for 14.3% of the total number of cities in Liaoning Province, and the overall resilience degree is low; the spatial distribution shrinks along the Shenyang–Dalian Economic Belt toward both sides, with obvious “core-margin” characteristics. 2. The average score of urbanization quality increased from 0.0574 to 0.0966, showing a fluctuating upward trend; the regional difference was significant, and the “dual-core” characteristic was prominent. 3. During the study period, the 14 cities of Liaoning Province were in a state of imbalance, and there was a positive correlation between the coupling degree and the coordination degree. Moran’s I decreased from 0.237 to 0.220 and the spatial agglomeration characteristics also weakened. Further analysis of the spatial and temporal linkage characteristics of the coupling relationship shows that the relative length of LISA time path presents characteristics of protrusion in the central region and shrinkage on the East and West sides, and the curvature presents characteristics that are smaller in the North and larger in the South.
