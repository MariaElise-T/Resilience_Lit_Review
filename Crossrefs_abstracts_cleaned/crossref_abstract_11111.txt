The results of a study investigating the response of farmers to adverse weather events are outlined. The aim was to identify adaptive management activities that would increase on-farm resilience. This project focused on beef/sheep farmers, dairy farmers and horticulturalists in Northland. Participants were pragmatic about adverse weather events, particularly storms. Local knowledge, previous experiences, information and networks helped build resilience. Participants highlighted a range of tactical decisions to address immediate damage from storms. However, strategic planning and adaption varied amongst farmers and orchardists as assessment of the cost-benefit of strategic actions differed. This information can be used to help farmers and organisations that assist with recovery assess and build resilience to adverse weather events.
