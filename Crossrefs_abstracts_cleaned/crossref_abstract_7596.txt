A study of electrostatic fluctuations in a weakly ionized plasma confined by a purely toroidal magnetic field B is presented. At low B field the plasma is quiescent and transport is provided by stationary EÃ—B flows along open equipotential surfaces. For B above a certain threshold, strong electrostatic fluctuations are excited, and the electron pressure profile on the low-field side is resilient with scale length much shorter than the threshold scale length for flute instability. At threshold the fluctuations exhibit the signatures of a monochromatic drift mode, and above threshold they are dominated by flute modes growing on the low-field side. Threshold behavior and profile resilience are explained as a two-stage process, where drift waves act as a seed for the unstable flute modes, and where a negative feedback mechanism involving anomalous transport regulates the electron pressure profile to maintain the imposed particle flux.
