Renewfood manufacturing: Food production for a nourished, resilient nation
Dr Kang Lan Tee, Matthew Hutchinson, Joe Price and Professor Tuck Seng Wong from the University of Sheffield explain the importance of re-imagining food production to support people and the planet. Food transcends its basic role as a human necessity, encompassing a multifaceted significance in our lives. Beyond its fundamental function of providing nutrition and sustenance, food is a profound social instrument, it not only nourishes our bodies but also nourishes our relationships and interactions. Food production is undoubtedly vital to livelihoods everywhere. We gather around a shared meal with our family and friends, using this communal experience to foster and maintain deep interpersonal connections. In business, food is a catalyst for successful negotiations as we convene with clients or customers over a meal, forging bonds and laying the groundwork for prosperous partnerships.
