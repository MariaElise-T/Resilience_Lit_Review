Introduction: The experience of professional demands in the case of teachers is a problem that goes beyond the in-dividual challenges of the subject. None of us would like to be taught by someone constantly tired. On the other hand, teachers play an essential role in passing on knowledge and educating the youngest generations, so the future of each citizen indirectly depends on them. Therefore, the broadly understood well-being of this professional group is a socially and thus scientifically significant problem. One of the resources that can be a salutogenic factor in the face of the burdens that teachers ex¬perience is resilience – a relatively constant personality trait. According to the Job De¬mands-Resources Theory (JD-R, Bakker, Demerouti, 2017) and the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR, Hobfoll, 2006) resilience may not only reduce the adverse effects of high professional demands but also promote personal development. 
Method: The research aimed to determine the moderating role of resilience between the job demands and chronic fatigue. The study was longitudinal, with a five-month break between subsequent measurements. One hundred sixty-seven teachers participated (some data, average age, gender proportions). I collected the research material using the diagnostic survey method, which included the following research instruments: Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-25), Checklist Individual Stenght (CIS20R) and selected scales from the Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI). 
Results: In the study sample, only two dimensions of resilience (understood as a relatively constant property of the individual) moderated the relationship between work-related stressors and the manifestations of chronic teacher fatigue. 
Conclusions: The results of the research suggest the need to develop good practices in the field of shaping resilience and, consequently, the sense of well-being of teachers and the effectiveness and efficiency of teaching related to it.
