Research on enhancing power system resilience against extreme events is attracting significant attention and becoming a top global agenda. In this paper, a preventive augmented power dispatch model is proposed to provide a resilient operation. In the proposed model, a new N-1-1 security criterion is proposed to select disruptive N-1-1 contingency cases that might trigger cascading blackouts, and an iterative contingency assessment process based on the line outage distribution factor is proposed to deal with security constraints. In terms of optimization objectives, two objectives related to power flow on the transmission line are considered to reduce the possibility of overload outages. Controllable series compensation devices are also considered in the model to improve the power flow distribution. Case studies conducted on the modified IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and Polish 2382-bus systems show that the power flow solution of the proposed power dispatch model can avoid some branches from undertaking excessively heavy loads, especially lines forecasted to be affected by extreme events. The results of blackout simulations through a hidden failure cascading outage simulation model show that the average power losses of the proposed model are reduced by around 40% in some cases as compared to the classical economic dispatch model.
