The paper aims to assess the resilience of fintechs to epidemic crises in Africa. This study is new in that it is one of the few to have examined the impact of fintechs on monetary stability in the African region, and it shows how digital tools have become crucial for regions to better manage their response to the crisis. To do so, we use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique to investigate the complexity of the relationship between Fintechs and monetary stability during the years 2011, 2014 and 2017. The study confirms that debit card use leads to an increase in inflation and participates in the decline of the interest rate. We also find that the use of the internet during transactions plays a stimulating role in lowering inflation, encouraging currency transactions and reinforcing the increase in interest rates. Finally, we conclude that the stability of money in bank accounts decreases the effect of inflationary pressures but favors exchange rates and interest rates together as a result of the increase in money.
