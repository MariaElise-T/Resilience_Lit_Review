Resilient modulus, , is an important parameter for designing pavements. However, its determination by resorting to cyclic triaxial tests is tedious and time consuming. Moreover, empirical relationships, correlating to various other material properties (namely, California Bearing Ratio, CBR; Limerock Bearing Ratio, LBR; R-value and the Soil Support Value, SSV), give vast variation in the estimated results. With this in view, an electronic circuitry, which employs bender and extender elements (i.e., piezo-ceramic elements), was developed. Details of the circuitry and the testing methodology adopted for this purpose are presented in this paper. This methodology helps in determining the resilient modulus of the material quite precisely. Further, it is believed that this methodology would be quite useful to engineers and technologists for conducting quality check of the pavements, quite rapidly and easily.
