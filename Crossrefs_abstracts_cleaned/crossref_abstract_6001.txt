ObjectiveTo determine changes in drill bit performance attributable to application of a triaxially resilient, hard‚Äêcarbon thin film.Study DesignIn vitro mechanical study.MethodsFive matched pairs of control bits and bits with a carbon nanofilm applied were tested in equine cortical bone and a synthetic bone substrate. Thirty sequential holes were drilled with each bit. Drilling time was recorded for all holes. Maximum substrate temperature was measured with infrared thermography for holes 1, 15, and 30. Drilling time, prolongation of drilling time over successive uses, and maximum substrate temperature were compared between control and test bits in each substrate.ResultsDrilling time was significantly reduced with test bits in both substrates. Drilling time over successive osteotomies increased more slowly with test bits than with control bits. Test bits generated significantly lower substrate temperatures during drilling.ConclusionsBits with the carbon nanofilm completed osteotomy faster and generated less heat than control bits. Test bits also had less degradation of drilling performance with repeated use.
