SummaryDisturbances are believed to be one of the main factors influencing variations in community diversity and functioning. Here we investigated if exposure to a pH press disturbance affected the composition and functional performance of a bacterial community and its resistance, recovery and resilience to a second press disturbance (salt addition). Lake bacterial assemblages were initially exposed to reduced pH in six mesocosms whereas another six mesocosms were kept as reference. Seven days after the pH disturbance, three tanks from each treatment were exposed to a salt disturbance. Both bacterial production and enzyme activity were negatively affected by the salt treatment, regardless if the communities had been subject to a previous disturbance or not. However, cell‐specific enzyme activity had a higher resistance in communities pre‐exposed to the pH disturbance compared to the reference treatment. In contrast, for cell‐specific bacterial production resistance was not affected, but recovery was faster in the communities that had previously been exposed to the pH disturbance. Over time, bacterial community composition diverged among treatments, in response to both pH and salinity. The difference in functional recovery, resilience and resistance may depend on differences in community composition caused by the pH disturbance, niche breadth or acquired stress resistance.
