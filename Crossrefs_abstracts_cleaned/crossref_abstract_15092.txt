The logistics and manufacturing industries’ co-agglomeration (LMCA) and deep integration, as well as the industries’ digital transformation and intelligent upgrading, are of great significance to enhance regional economic resilience (EcoResi). This paper establishes a theoretical framework for LMCA and EcoResi based on the economic development theory and the new economic geography theory, explores the spatial spillover effect of LMCA on EcoResi, and measures the levels of LMCA and EcoResi. The data set is consisted of the indicators of LMCA and GDP growth rate of 30 provinces, centrally administered municipalities, and autonomous regions in China from 2006 to 2020. Spatial econometric models were used to empirically analyze the impact of LMCA on EcoResi based on provincial panel data. The results show that the improvement in LMCA not only improves the resilience of local economy, but it also has a significant spatial spillover effect. Further regional analyses show that LMCA has significant stimulating effects and spatial spillover effects on EcoResi in the central and western regions of China. However, the same effects are not significant in the eastern region of China. This research enriches the literature by suggesting effective ways to enhance EcoResi through LMCA.
