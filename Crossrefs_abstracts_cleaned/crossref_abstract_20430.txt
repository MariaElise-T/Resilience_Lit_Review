 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. The devastation displaced many families and led to negative mental health outcomes. We use the intersection of Oyserman’s possible selves’ theory and Walsh’s family resilience theory, to aid in elucidating the process of positive familial coping within resilience among Latinx families. Nine different family units participated in an art-based intervention and subsequent focus groups in Florida in November 2018. Grounded theory guided analysis, and themes emerged using intersecting aspects of the above-mentioned theories. Understanding the impact that positive familial selves have on resilience can lead to future development of family interventions and a better understanding of how to foster resilience.
