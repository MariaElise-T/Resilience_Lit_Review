Natural disasters whose scale of damage exceeds the level that regional governments can afford are increasing. As such disasters have increased, the damage to local communities tends to be prolonged. Accordingly, it is important to prevent prolonged disaster damage and secure resilience to ensure quick recovery from the damage. This study analyzed the regional factors that can affect resilience to disaster, quantifying the regional resilience of each sigungu administrative district in Korea that suffered damage from natural disasters during the period 2010-2017 using the resilience cost index (RCI). We investigated the relationship between change in resilience cost index by year and changes in regional factors by year to identify the regions where industrial diversity was secured so as to reduce the exposure of each industry to disaster, budgets for social welfare were increased, and participation in volunteer activities was expanded, all of which tend to improve regional resilience.
