Significance
We live in a time of increasing terror, stress, and trauma, and yet humans show a remarkable ability to cope under high stress states. How the brain supports such active resilient coping is not well-understood. Findings showed high stress levels are accompanied by dynamic brain signals in circuits representing the stress reaction, adaptation, and behavioral control responses. In addition, a ventromedial prefrontal cortical region showed initial decreases in brain activation, but then mobilized with increased activation, and this dynamic change was correlated with active coping. Conversely, individuals who failed to show such “neuroflexibility” in this specific ventromedial prefrontal region reported higher maladaptive coping behaviors. Findings suggest that strategies to promote such neuroflexibility under stress may increase stress resilience in humans.
