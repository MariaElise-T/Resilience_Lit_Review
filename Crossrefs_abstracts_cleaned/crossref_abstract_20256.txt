 This paper addresses the resilient formation control problem for heterogeneous multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) under false data injection (FDI) attacks and prescribed performance constraints. The case of both actuator and sensor attacks is considered simultaneously, and the multi-UAV can exchange the information through a directed communication network. A fuzzy adaptive observer (FAO) is first proposed to estimate the FDI attacks and the unmeasurable velocity information for each UAV. In order to transform the formation control of heterogeneous multi-UAV into a trajectory tracking control problem of individual UAVs, a bank of distributed estimators is designed to achieve the leaderâ€™s states by only using local information among neighboring UAVs. Then, by incorporating a novel tracking error transform method and fractional-order sliding mode control technique, a resilient prescribed performance tracking controller without velocity measurements is constructed. Furthermore, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop formation control systems are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stable under FDI attacks. Finally, the simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy.
