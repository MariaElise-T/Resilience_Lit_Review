This paper deals with stochastic comparisons of two parallel (series) systems with Type II half logistic-resilience scale (TIIHL-RS) distribution components with different baseline distribution functions. Under the conditions of interdependency and independency, the research shows that the system performance is better (worse) with the stronger component heterogeneity in the parallel (series) system under the usual stochastic order and the (reversed) hazard rate order.
