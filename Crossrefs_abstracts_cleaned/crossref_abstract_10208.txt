The paper identifies the determinants influencing spatial planning for urban resilience within the context of an Islamic society. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with relevant stakeholders in spatial planning and disaster management in the city of Banda Aceh, Indonesia to assess their attitudes, opinions and experiences in implementing spatial planning for urban resilience. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed dominant factors specific to the Islamic society in the city of Banda Aceh, which were then elaborated on and categorised into five major groups: spatial pattern, spatial structure, spatial culture, spatial-related non-physical factors and religious factors. The interviews affirmed the importance of religious and cultural factors in spatial planning for urban resilience within Islamic societies. The findings will provide an essential understanding of the need to enhance urban resilience against disasters in the urban planning process and incorporate aspects of local wisdom derived from religious and cultural values, as well as societal necessities, as a planning approach. Given the context-specific nature of this research, future researchers may consider doing a comparative case study in another city with similar characteristics.
