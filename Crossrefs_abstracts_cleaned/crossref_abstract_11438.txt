Cyber resilience refers to an organization's ability to maintain its essential functions, services despite cyber-attacks and swiftly recover from any disruptions. It involves proactive measures like gathering threat intelligence and managing risks, as well as reactive measures such as incident response planning, data backup and recovery. To achieve cyber resilience, organizations must implement robust cyber security measures, regularly update their incident response plans, and educate employees on safe online practices. Furthermore, having a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy in place is crucial to swiftly restore critical systems and data in the event of an attack. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes cyber resilience as a continuous and proactive approach for managing cyber security risks and safeguarding against the growing threat of cyber-attacks.
