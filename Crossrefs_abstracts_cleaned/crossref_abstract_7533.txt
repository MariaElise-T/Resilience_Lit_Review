This paper is concerned with the problem of designing robust H-infinity output feedback controller and resilient filtering for a class of discrete-time singular piecewise-affine systems with input saturation and state constraints. Based on a singular piecewise Lyapunov function combined with S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexifying techniques, the H-infinity stabilization condition is established and the resilient H-infinity filtering error dynamic system is investigated, and, meanwhile, the domain of attraction is well estimated. Under energy bounded disturbance, the input saturation disturbance tolerance condition is proposed; then, the resilient H-infinity filter is designed in some restricted region. It is shown that the controller gains and filter design parameters can be obtained by solving a family of LMIs parameterized by one or two scalar variables. Meanwhile, by using the corresponding optimization methods, the domain of attraction and the disturbance tolerance level is maximized, and the H-infinity performanceÎ³is minimized. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.
