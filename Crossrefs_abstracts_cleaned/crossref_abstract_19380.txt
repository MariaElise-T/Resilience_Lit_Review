An important indicator for measuring the resilience and ability of urban networks to recover under external environmental shock, which is essential for the healthy development of the region, is urban network structure resilience. Herein we analyzed the resilience of the urban network structure and explored the influencing factors of resilience in the three provinces of Northeast China. We accomplished this by utilizing the Gephi profiling social network analysis tools based on the Baidu Index, road mileage, statistical data, other multi-source data, construction information, and the transportation, innovation, and economic multiple linkage network. This analysis enabled us to propose relevant suggestions and strategies to optimize urban network structure resilience. Our results indicate that (1) in 2019, the multi-city network structure in the three provinces of Northeast China contains both commonalities and characteristics. Overall, each network demonstrates a spatial distribution pattern of “dense in the north and sparse in the south.” (2) There exist evident hierarchical differences in the resilience characteristics of the multi-city network structure in the three provinces; each provincial capital city and sub-provincial city possesses greater advantages, the innovation network exhibits the most evident hierarchy, the mismatch of the information network is the highest, and the transmission and agglomeration of the economic network are the most prominent. (3) The resilience of the urban network structure of the three provinces is the result of the interaction of several factors. Political and economic factors such as government capacity, economic status, and urban vitality are the main factors affecting the resilience of the network structure.
