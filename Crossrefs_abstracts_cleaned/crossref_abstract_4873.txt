Various types of urban art emerged and prospered in recent decades when degenerating cities were embracing art as a marketing strategy. This urban-rejuvenation approach sheds less light on the agency and motivation of artists. This paper examines how ethnic artists represent traumatic memory, reflect nostalgia and mobilize individuals to collaborate with one other to build resilience. This study contributes to the literature that explores the agency and creativity of underrepresented minority artists in global society at large.
