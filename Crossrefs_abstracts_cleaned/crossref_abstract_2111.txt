 For international healthcare NGOs, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant. Healthcare workers in both LMICs and high-income countries have described the impact of the pandemic as traumatic. This article focuses on one initiative designed to address this impact: CMMB’s Building Resiliency program. This article provides an overview of the structure and content of program, situating it within the landscape of global mental healthcare disparities and caregiver trauma. Designed to address caregiver mental health in Peru, Haiti, Kenya, South Sudan, and Zambia, the program sought to offset global mental healthcare disparities by bringing needed psycho-social-spiritual support to CMMB staff. It was intentionally shaped by the commitments of Catholic social thought—particularly to the well-being, dignity, and integral human development of CMMB staff members, to envisaging new forms of solidarity, and to prioritizing subsidiarity and participation. Theories of post-traumatic growth provided the theoretical framework for three remotely delivered seminar series, which made space for staff members to share their stories with their colleagues, to build community, to foster creativity and hope, and to intentionally integrate faith and spirituality into both personal self-care as well as the common life of the organization. Thus, this was designed equally to build the organizational resiliency that is the fruit of Catholic social thought. For attending to caregivers’ mental health and well-being is crucial not only for the success of medical missions but for embodying and witnessing the Catholic commitment to the human dignity and the integral development of those who do the work of our organizations.
