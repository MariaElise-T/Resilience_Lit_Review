 Long-term studies of vegetation succession can inform restoration of degraded forests. We examined resilience of a boreal mixedwood vegetation community, asking whether treatments employed to restore wood production in a degraded ecosystem could also restore diversity and composition of vegetation communities. The Inga Lake trial, established in 1987 in northeastern British Columbia, used mechanical, fire, and chemical and manual treatments, encompassing a gradient of restoration effort, and tree planting to restore a shrubland to white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forest. We monitored vascular plant, bryophyte, and macrolichen composition five times over 31Â years on five to seven treatments replicated five times. We used mixed-effects models and nonmetric multidimensional scaling to compare diversity and composition among treatments and with mature reference forests. Low- to high-effort restoration created a gradient from broadleaf- to spruce-dominated overstories. Diversity increased with restoration effort. Four of 253 taxa occurred in mature forests only. There was no evidence that lower versus higher effort treatments followed divergent successional pathways toward broadleaved versus spruce reference communities. Our results suggest that these mixedwood vegetation communities lie within a broad domain of successional attraction that confers high ecological resilience to disturbance. Gap cuttings to stimulate understory re-initiation and provide woody debris are recommended to complete the restoration.
