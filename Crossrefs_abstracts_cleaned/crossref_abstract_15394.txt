Background and Purpose: COVID-19 could be a threat to healthcare workers' mental health. This study was conducted to investigate job burnout and its relationship with the resilience level of the personnel in the COVID-19 treatment hospital in southern Iran.
Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 on 496 personnel of Hazrat Ali Asghar (AS) Hospital selected as the center of COVID-19 in southern Iran. The participants of the study were selected using the census. Data collection tools were the standard Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Data analysis was performed using t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression in SPSS23 at a significance level of 0.05.
Results: The mean scores of job burnout and resilience were 76.95 ± 14.36 (of 132) and 71.21 ± 8.24 (of 125), respectively which indicated the moderate level of these two variables. There was a significant inverse correlation between job burnout and resilience (P<0.001, r= - 0.514). Spiritual influences (P<0.001), perception of competence (P=0.001), positive acceptance of change and secure relationships (P= 0.001), trust in individual instincts (P= 0.02), and control (P= 0.03) of resilience aspects were identified as predictors of job burnout. Additionally, there was a statistically significant relationship between job burnout and gender (P=0.001) and occupational group (P= 0.04); and between resilience and gender (P= 0.02) and with marital status (P= 0.03).
Conclusion: Job burnout status and personnel resilience were at a moderate level. It was recommended to train employees with resilience-enhancing skills employees according to each of their dimensions.
