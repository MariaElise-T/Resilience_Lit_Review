The present study examines the relationship between Perceived Organizational Politics (POP) and self-reported Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) focusing on three mediating variables, transactional leadership, transformational leadership, and resilience. 210 employees from a variety of organizations and backgrounds completed a questionnaire containing standard measures of the study variables. Analysis of the data using Amos statistical package shows that OCB is significantly associated with POP, and that leadership styles and resilience significantly mediate this association. The results are discussed in terms of employees&rsquo; motivation to react to lack of perceived clarity, justice and fairness by enhancing their self-report of OCB engagement. Further research is needed to better understand the meaning of self-reported OCB.
