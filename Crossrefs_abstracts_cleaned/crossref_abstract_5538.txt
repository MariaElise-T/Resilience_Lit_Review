Abstract
Modern society is characterized by the increasing interdependence between the actors of the international environment, in the conditions of globalization of all the fields of social life. Increasing interdependencies, together with the emergence of new risks and threats, which attempt to exploit systemic vulnerabilities, which are increasingly numerous and difficult to eliminate, bring a new issue to states and other security environment actors: to ensure the protection the infrastructure elements that are indispensable to the normal activity of the population, economic agents, nongovernmental organizations and state institutions. Critical Infrastructure Protection becomes an important point on the agenda of all decision-makers who are in a position to counter the asymmetric threats that jeopardize national interests and democratic values. Due to the multiplication of risks and threats and the multiplication of interdependencies between the various infrastructure elements, the protection of critical infrastructures can not be achieved effectively only by ensuring their physical protection. The cascading effects of a disturbance can be felt at the level of society as a whole, and it is therefore necessary to address the issue of ensuring the protection of critical infrastructures in a comprehensive manner including infrastructure and community resilience issues.
