Academic involvement refers to the active participation of students in the learning environment. There are several factors that directly or indirectly influence students' academic involvement, including spirituality, achievement motivation, and resilience. This research aims to explore the impact of spirituality on academic involvement by examining its relationship with achievement motivation and resilience. The research adopts a quantitative correlational approach and considers three types of variables: independent variables, dependent variables, and intervening variables. The study involves 200 active students from the Islamic Religious Education Study Program at Universitas Muhammadiyah Magelang, who were selected using a lottery method. Data collection for this research was done through a questionnaire, and the analysis involved descriptive statistics and path analysis. The findings of the study demonstrate a significant influence of spirituality on students' academic involvement through achievement motivation and resilience. This suggests that spirituality has an impact on both achievement motivation and resilience. Furthermore, the study reveals that achievement motivation and resilience also play a role in shaping students' academic involvement. Overall, the results indicate that spirituality positively affects academic involvement by promoting achievement motivation and resilience. Thus, students with strong spirituality tend to exhibit higher levels of achievement motivation and resilience, which in turn positively contribute to their academic involvement.
