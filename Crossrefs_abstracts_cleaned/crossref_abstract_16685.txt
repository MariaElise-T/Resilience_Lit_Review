The distribution system is easily affected by extreme weather, leading to an increase in the probability of critical equipment failures and economic losses. Actively scheduling various resources to provide emergency power support can effectively reduce power outage losses caused by extreme weather. This paper proposes a mobile energy storage system (MESS) scheduling strategy for improving the resilience of distribution networks under ice disasters. First, the influence of wind and ice loads on power transmission lines is analyzed, and a detailed fault statistical model of transmission lines under an ice disaster is established. Then, the MESS scheduling problem considering the coupling of transportation-distribution networks is transformed into a two-stage optimization problem. The first stage determines the optimal configuration scheme for MESS, and in the second stage, the optimal path selection for MESS can be obtained. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm proposed in this paper are verified through an improved IEEE-33 node testing system.
