Resilience in the ability to bounce back in the face of adversity. Some people become overwhelmed by life`s challenges and tragedies, while some others seem to maintain their bearings in the face of adversity. Research has indicated that resilient people generally use effective coping strategies, have a firm understanding of reality, a deep and meaningful belief system, the ability to improvise and have a strong belief in the future. Hope includes the ability to motivate oneself and persist in the face of difficult situation while Meaning in life helps in positive coping and adaptation. The purpose of the present investigation is to study the relation between meaning in life, hope and resilience.
