Introduction. The capacity to respond and adapt to the risks and problems in an organization is critical for business success. Any type of weakness causes inefficient use of resources. On the contrary, flexible facilities can ensure the continuity of operations in the face of disruptive events, which significantly harm the company if they are not controlled. However, flexibility is not achieved only with the optimization of facilities, as resilient approaches can enhance it. Objective. To synthesize the variables and indicators with greater use in three different areas, business resilience, the textile industry, and the facility layout problem (FLP) in the textile industry. Methodology. The research is of a bibliographic-documentary nature. A systematic literature review was conducted, using the Fink methodology, considering 99 studies published between 2010 and 2021. The documents were analyzed using the Atlas.ti software; subsequently, a 4W (when, who, what, and where) analysis was used; finally, answers were given to three research questions posed through the PICO strategy. Results. The findings indicate that, there is a scarcity of studies about resilient FLPs, however, it is notable that the scientific interest regarding resilience has increased in the last six years, specifically in assessment methods and approaches to identify resilience factors and indicators in the industry through fuzzy mathematical models. Conclusions. Studies about resilience applied to FLP are not developed to a great extent worldwide, in the Ecuadorian context resilience has not been explored in depth. Eventually, the importance of indicators for an accurate model is highlighted and a series of indicators for the analysis of the behavior of facility layout with a resilient approach based on FLP factors is proposed.
