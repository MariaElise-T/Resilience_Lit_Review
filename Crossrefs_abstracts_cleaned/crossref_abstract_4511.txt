This research aims to examine the resilience of adolescents according to their exposure to cyberbullying, gender, grade level, parental education level, school type and time spent on social media. Participants consisted of 1040 high school students between the ages of 14-19. Data were collected using the APRS, CVS and PIF, and analyzed with the two-factor ANOVA technique. Data analysis shows that the resilience of the adolescents not exposed to cyberbullying was found to be higher than the adolescents exposed to cyberbullying. It is seen that the resilience of girls is higher than that of boys. It is observed that the resilience of the students decreases as the time they spend daily on social media increases. In addition, it is seen that the education level of the mother had a significant effect on the resilience of the students. It is determined that the variables of father's education level, high school type and grade level do not differ significantly on the resilience of the students. It is found that the joint effect of exposure to cyberbullying and mother's education level has a significant effect on resilience, while the interactions of other variables do not have a significant effect on resilience.
