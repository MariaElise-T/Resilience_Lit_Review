Abstract
This paper proposes a seismic resilience grading method for 110Kv and above high-voltage substations, and establishes a quantitative index for evaluating the substation seismic resilience --- seismic resilience index, presents a calculation formula for substation seismic resilience index which takes the respective weight coefficients and seismic damage indexes of buildings and high-voltage electrical equipment as the parameters, determines the relationship between the resilience index and the resilience grade, and establishes the substation resilience matrix through making statistics of actual seismic damage and recovered samples of the substations. The results show that with the decrease of resilience index, the resilience of substation becomes worse and worse. When the resilience index is lower than 0.45, the substation reaches the threshold of extremely difficult to recover. The higher the seismic intensity is, the lower the resilience is, and the longer the recovery time is. In 9 degree seismic intensity region, the substation resilience index begins to decrease rapidly, most substations are recoverable and difficult to recover, and the substations in 10 degrees and above seismic intensity region are extremely difficult to recover.
