Green infrastructure for ecosystem resilience
Mita Drius and Luana Silveri from the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, explain fostering green infrastructure for ecosystem resilience in Alpine regions. The FRACTAL model, we hear, is a bottom-up all-round approach. In the last century, human population growth and industrial development have led to the depletion of natural resources, ecosystem degradation, and a worrying change in global climatic conditions. Habitat and ecosystem fragmentation due to land use change is recognised as one of the most striking threats to biodiversity. Fragmentation of habitats alters speciesâ€™ normal life cycle and ecology by preventing them from reaching their migration and dispersal destinations.
