This study examines the effects of corporate short-termism on organisational resilience, using a unique panel data set on a sample of 36 listed companies purposefully drawn from an array of industries in Zimbabwe from 2010 to 2018. By using the Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond System Generalised Methods of Moments (Sys-GMM) dynamic estimator, this study effectively addresses autocorrelation, hetero scedasticity and endogeneity in the analysis of panel data. The main results of this study suggest that strategic capital expenditures generate more benefits than tactical capital expenditures. However, additional results reveal that there is no material difference in the benefits generated by TCEs and SCEs when companies invest consistently. More importantly, the results of this study suggest that maintaining a right balance between short-term and long-term goals consistently guarantees organisational resilience.
