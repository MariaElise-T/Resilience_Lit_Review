This systematic literature review explores the digital transformation (DT) and cybersecurity implications for achieving business resilience. DT involves transitioning organizational processes to IT solutions, which can result in significant changes across various aspects of an organization. However, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data and analytics, blockchain, and cloud computing drive digital transformation worldwide while increasing cybersecurity risks for businesses undergoing this process. This literature survey article highlights the importance of comprehensive knowledge of cybersecurity threats during DT implementation to prevent interruptions due to malicious activities or unauthorized access by attackers aiming at sensitive information alteration, destruction, or extortion from users. Cybersecurity is essential to DT as it protects digital assets from cyber threats. We conducted a systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology in this research. Our literature review found that DT has increased efficiency and productivity but poses new challenges related to cybersecurity risks, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks. We conclude by discussing future vulnerabilities associated with DT implementation and provide recommendations on how organizations can mitigate these risks through effective cybersecurity measures. The paper recommends a staged cybersecurity readiness framework for business organizations to be prepared to pursue digital transformation.
