During the COVID-19 period, the e-learning system saw increased usage and study; existing dimensions related to technologies and learners are not adequately explored while discussing e-learning adoption. As a technology, adopting e-learning for education in Indonesia confronts numerous resilience problems due to its benefits. This article analyzed the resilience paradoxes, namely, transformation, sociocultural, modernization, integrity, and ethics, to raise awareness and elicit the essential responses to enhance e-learning adoption and utilization. The approach used in this study is qualitative and phenomenological. 25 people were interviewed for this research; participants include teachers and students. The analysis step is easier to understand and is explicitly designed to analyze and conceptualize qualitative data using the most recent QSR qualitative research software. The study examined the divergent and contradictory perspectives of technology supporters and technology doubters on e-learning in Indonesian education; this gives a valid starting point for a critical and in-depth debate about e-learning; it is not simple to reconcile this dilemma. However, this study works to be knowledgeable of paradoxes and be prepared to resolve the issue and get the intended results.
