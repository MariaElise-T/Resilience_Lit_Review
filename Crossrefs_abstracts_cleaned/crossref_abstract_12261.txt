In the context of climate change, agricultural cultivation, as one of the most vulnerable sectors, is under threat. Extreme weather and climate conditions have caused a series of problems, such as yield loss, more serious pests and diseases, and declining biodiversity. Conservation tillage is considered a potential method to improve climate resilience, yet the intrinsic mechanism of how conservation tillage functions to improve the climate resilience of agriculture is uncertain. Here, we performed document analysis to explore how conservation tillage stabilizes and increases crop yield and reduces greenhouse gases. We reviewed the definition of resilience and proposed the practice of conservation tillage. Our research found that conservation tillage has the potential of improving soil health and reducing greenhouse gases to enhance climate resilience. Although there is some evidence demonstrating that conservation tillage has a negative impact on crop yield and greenhouse gases, we still advocate the adoption of conservation tillage according to local conditions. We suggest that choosing proper practices, such as crop rotation, the use of cover crops, and holistic grazing, when used along with conservation tillage, can maximize the benefits of conservation tillage and alleviate the possible negative effects of this practice.
