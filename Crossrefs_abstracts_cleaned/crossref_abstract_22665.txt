The article reveals the results of an analysis of resilience of the supply chain at the stage of distribution of finished pharmaceutical products in the Russian pharmaceutical industry against an ag-gressive external marketing environment. The key destabilizing factors for the external environment of the pharmaceutical market are identified and characterized: the Covid-19 epidemic, introduction of man-datory labeling of medicines, overstocking of the pharmaceutical market with the stabilization of the pandemic situation, a sharp increase in geopolitical tensions, and an increase in the sanctions pressure. The decrease in the supply chain resilience at the distribution stage in the Russian pharmaceutical indus-try is proven on the example of the non-prescription drugs segment under the influence of external shocks to the industry. The stability of this trend has been revealed against the background of deepening geopolitical tensions, tightening of the sanctions restrictions, transformation of the Russian advertising market, and the decrease in the purchasing power of the population. The authors have substantiated the need for pharmaceutical companies to adapt to the described situation through developing the automa-tion and digitalization of business, increasing the role of tactical marketing planning, and digitalization of sales and changing the composition of analytical departments.
