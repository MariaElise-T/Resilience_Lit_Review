Resilience in ports is an important thing that must be considered. This study focuses on the resilience elements conducted to measure the current level of resilience of the targeted areas of Konsortium Pelabuhan Kemaman using an analytical hierarchy process. Resilience is developed based on four factors: responding, monitoring, learning, and anticipating. This study aims to identify an aspect of resilience, rank the most critical element at the port, and recommend the best solution to improving resilience in Consortium Port Kemaman. This study involved ten representatives from the operation, pilotage, and safety departments at Konsortium Pelabuhan Kemaman. Based on the results, recommendations for improving resilience are made by the authors to the port. Higher values of resilience are equivalent to increased preparedness to cope with climate change and disasters.
