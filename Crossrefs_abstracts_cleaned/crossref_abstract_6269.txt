The construction of modern cryptographic systems relies on the so-called
   resilient Boolean functions, a special class of Boolean functions that
   possesses a balance between a high level of nonlinearity and correlation
   immunity. In this paper, we discuss the problem of the compact representation
   and efficient construction of resilient functions. Binary Decision Diagrams
   (BDDs) were extensively used as a method of compact representation of various
   classes of Boolean functions. Furthermore, BDDs offer an opportunity for the
   efficient implementation of different construction methods for resilient
   functions. In this paper, we make use of BDDs with attributed edges to
   provide an implementation of two construction methods proposed by Maitra and
   Sakar. In addition, we demonstrate that the size of BDDs of resilient
   functions obtained in this way grows linearly with the number of variables.
