 The present article first theoretically defines the term “resilience” from the clinical psychoanalytic standpoint, in view of differentiating normal development from pathological development following trauma. It then formalize two essential processes underlying resilience: mentalization and the ability to identify a developmental tutor . We studied two Romanian 12-year-old twin girls who exhibit opposing adaptations following multiple, cumulative traumas (premature birth, early severe deficiencies, parental maltreatment, parental abdication and abandonment). The study is a projective clinical study that uses a pluridimensional methodology (interviews, storytelling test, Rorschach test, and house-drawing test). The clinical data obtained clearly demonstrate the importance of two major axes in accounting for resilience or maladjustment in the face of trauma.
