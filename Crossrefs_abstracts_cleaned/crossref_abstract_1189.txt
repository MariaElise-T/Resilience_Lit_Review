This study investigates the effects of recurrent wildfires on the resilience of a typical Mediterranean ecosystem. It is based on uninterrupted monitoring over 42 years of the avifauna in a cork oak forest that burned three times during this time interval. The monitoring involved two line-transect counts in spring accompanied by the simultaneous and independent estimation of the vegetation cover profile. One of the two transects was initially designed to serve as an unburned control before it also burned during the second fire. Many forest bird species were already present from the first spring postfire due to the rapid regeneration of the canopy. Some open-habitat bird species colonized the burned area during the first 2â€“4 years after the fire, resulting in an initial phase of high diversity. The postfire bird succession was mainly driven by sedentary species that recolonized the burned area after the first winter, whereas most migratory species present before the fire resettled as early as the first postfire spring, probably because of site tenacity. It was found that the impact of the second fire on avifauna was lower than that of the first or third fire. The return to an avifauna and forest structure successionally equivalent to the prefire control was achieved in about 15 years, which can be considered as the recovery time. Afterwards, both vegetation and avifauna in the burned areas tended to take on more forest characteristics than in the prefire control. These findings suggest that: (i) the recurrence of fire does not necessarily result in the cumulative degradation of the ecosystem at each repetition; (ii) the asymptotic resilience model is not adapted to the case of disturbances in non-mature environments; (iii) the notion of returning to an original undisturbed baseline is illusive in an area that has been under continuous human influence since ancient times.
