This study aimed to revise and test the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Decisional and Emotional Forgiveness Scale. In experiment 1, 1171 college students and postgraduates were invited to complete the questionnaire that provides the data for this scale. The results from this, following exploratory factor analysis, showed that the factor loading values met the standards detailed in the past literature, except in the case of item C2. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (while excluding item C2) showed a good structure validity. Furthermore, it also showed that a four-factor model fit the data well and that the reliability values (including internal consistency and test–retest reliability) met the commonly held standards. Decisional and emotional forgiveness subfactors were significantly correlated with transgression-related interpersonal motivations and self-construal. Experiment 2 was conducted in order to further confirm the validity of the scale: the results of mediated analysis showed that emotional forgiveness and the path from decisional forgiveness to emotional forgiveness could mediate the relationship between stress perception and resilience. Thus, the revised Chinese version of the Decisional and Emotional Forgiveness Scale showed good reliability and validity within a Chinese sample, demonstrating its usability as an effective tool to evaluate college students’ level of decisional and emotional forgiveness.
