This study aimed to review articles on student academic resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in chemistry lessons. This research is systematic research using the PRISMA method. The systematic review used articles from the range 2020-2023 published in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. A total of 4 articles on the resilience of students studying chemistry during the COVID-19 pandemic met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that journals discussing student resilience in studying chemistry during the COVID-19 pandemic were still limited. However, from this literature research, it turns out that academic resilience is considered capable of maintaining learning success in students during the COVID-19 pandemic
