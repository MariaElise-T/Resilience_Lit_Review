ABSTRACTThe Multipath Protection (MPP) network resilience methods route and protect the upcoming demand over multiple paths. Although these schemes are able to allocate resources efficiently in the network, the length of the paths that the packets traverse cannot be controlled. Accordingly, to control the latency of the connections, we reuse the idea of MPP when we propose the Path‐based Multipath Protection (PMPP) scheme. By controlling the maximal length of the paths, we increase the availability as well, because on shorter paths, fewer failures happen. The contribution of our work is threefold. First, we give the linear programming formulation of the PMPP method that does not have any integer variables resulting from polynomial runtime, similar to the former MPP methods. Second, we present extensive simulation results including the blocking ratios, the properties of the paths and the availabilities. Finally, we compare the PMPP resilience scheme with the original and improved versions of MPP method on the basis of several metrics. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
