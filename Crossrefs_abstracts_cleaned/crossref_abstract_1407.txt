AbstractThis article has two aims: (1) to assess the impacts of a novel training intervention for individual well‐being and (2) to measure the trajectory of resilience over the training period dependent on reported significant life events. Using a randomised controlled trial with a diverse German sample with the majority drawn from a student population, we measure the effects of the intervention to provide insight into its impacts and act as a proof of concept for the training. We find that the training intervention boosts resilience and other related well‐being measures with a high effect size in comparison with a control group and compared with existing resilience training studies.
