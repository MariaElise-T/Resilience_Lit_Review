Delivery of the prefabricated components may be disrupted by low productivity and various of traffic restrictions, thus delaying the prefabricated construction project. However, planning of the prefabricated component supply chain (PCSC) under disruptions has seldom been studied. This paper studies the construction schedule-dependent resilience for the PCSC plan by considering transportation costs and proposes a multi-objective optimization model. First, the PCSC planning problem regarding schedule-dependent resilience and resultant transportation cost is analyzed. Second, a quantification scheme of the schedule-dependent resilience of the PCSC plan is proposed. Third, formulation of the resilience-cost tradeoff optimization model for the PCSC planning is developed. Fourth, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)-based method for solving the resilience-cost tradeoff model is presented. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate and justify the developed method. This study contributes to the knowledge and methodologies for PCSC management by addressing resilience at the planning stage.
