Abstract
Cities are complex systems vulnerable to a multitude of risks and disruptions that are becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to urban overcrowding. Socio-economic, technological challenges, but especially natural ones, such as epidemics, have proven to be disruptive from several perspectives of human existence. The negative evolution of the disturbing factors led to the extension of the concept of resilience, traditionally used in socio-ecology, in the urban infrastructure. The aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of some sets of indicators, frameworks, and informatics solutions that can provide an image of how cities can become resilient urban areas. An exploratory analysis is conducted by studying scientific resources and specialized articles that address the issue of developing resilient cities supported by innovation and digital technology. With technology approaches, cities can be helped to prevent and reduce the effects of possible blockages or catastrophes, to respond and intervene promptly in case of crises, and to plan and organize properly in order to recover from shocks or stressors.
