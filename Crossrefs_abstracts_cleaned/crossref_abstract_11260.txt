Abstract
This research is motivated by the low student mathematical resilience. The purpose of this study is to look at the achievement of mathematical resilience of students who obtain learning using Microsoft Excel VBA with those using conventional learning. This study uses a quasi-experimental method with a non-equivalent pretest and posttest control group design. The subjects of this study were 70 second semester elementary school teacher candidates at IKIP Siliwangi. The instruments in this study used non-tests in the form of questionnaires and interviews. The results show that, 1) the achievement of mathematical resilience of students who get learning using Microsoft Excel VBA is better than those using conventional learning; 2) students who learn with Microsoft Excel VBA tend to be able to overcome difficulties if given difficult math problems, anxiety and fear in working on math problems are reduced, and more confident in expressing mathematical opinions/ideas; 3) mathematical resilience is not an instant thing to change so it needs environmental support so that studentsâ€™ mathematical resilience becomes better.
