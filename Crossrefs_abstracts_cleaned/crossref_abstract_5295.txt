AbstractWastewater‐fed aquaculture is generally in decline. The 12 500 ha East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) Ramsar site in peri‐urban Kolkata, India, is the only large‐scale formal system still operating and appears to demonstrate a high degree of resilience. This paper identifies aspects of wastewater‐fed aquaculture in the EKW that contribute to its sustained operation. The Driving Forces, Pressures, State, Impact, Response (DPSIR) framework was used to structure the assessment. Resilience within the EKW can be attributed to the scale of operation, adaptive production strategies that optimise resource utilisation while minimising risks, self‐organisation among stakeholders and timely legislation and institutional interventions to preserve the natural character of the wetlands. The introduction of externalising technologies, erosion of social capital and loss of traditional ecological knowledge threaten to undermine this resilience. Outcomes from this analysis should inform future management of the EKW to ensure that resilience is retained and enhanced.
