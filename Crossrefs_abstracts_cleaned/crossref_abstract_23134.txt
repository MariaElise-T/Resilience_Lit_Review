This paper analyzed the factors that influence the seismic resilience of urban building groups and studied the laws that influence internal factors and external factors. Based on the data from the first national comprehensive risk survey of natural disasters, a refined classification study of urban building groups was carried out. Based on the existing evaluation methods of seismic resilience of individual buildings, the recovery time was selected as the resilience evaluation index to calculate the effect of internal factors on the seismic resilience of urban building groups. Then, we studied the quantitative relationship between external factors (i.e., disaster relief capacity, population density, and economic level) and the evaluation indicators of seismic resilience of urban building groups, and we proposed the kilometer grid coefficient. Based on that, we proposed a calculation method of the effect of external factors on the seismic resilience of urban building groups. Considering the influence of internal and external factors, the evaluation model for the seismic resilience of urban building groups was established. And the model was applied in a typical city. This paper proposes a method to evaluate the seismic resilience of urban building groups, which can master the functional recovery time of urban building groups after an earthquake. Based on the proposed model, we can optimize the functional recovery path and emergency rescue path of the disaster area, as well as improve the resilience of urban building systems and the construction of resilient cities.
