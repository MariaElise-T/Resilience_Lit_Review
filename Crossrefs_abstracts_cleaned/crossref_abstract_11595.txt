 Developments in the area of post-traumatic growth are described and discussed with particular reference to the possible trauma of being involved in a road traffic accident. Research and clinical experience from both the USA and UK are outlined. Several different types of road accidents are described in terms of impact, physical injury and psychological reaction. Common areas of post-traumatic growth are described when building a positive growth-oriented narrative with victims. The importance of developing a robust set of core beliefs which can foster resilience to face future challenges is outlined. Reflections are given as how post-traumatic growth can occur both for victims and, vicariously for assessing or treating clinicians. There is an impact on clinicians of working with accident victims and this potential â€˜vicarious traumatisation is discussed.
