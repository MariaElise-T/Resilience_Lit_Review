Using a convenience sampling method, 60 patients were selected and randomly divided into three groups. Data were collected using the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (CD‐RISC) and analyzed adopting repeated measure analysis of variance. Data were analyzed by SPSS 22 software. Results: The results of repeated measure analysis of variance showed that spirituality and mindfulness-based interventions exerted effect on resilience (P≥0.008). Comparing the results also revealed that spirituality therapy had more powerful effect on resilience (P≥0.001). Conclusion: It was concluded that spirituality therapy and mindfulness-based training were both effective in promoting resilience in MS patients; however, spirituality therapy was found to be more effective in increasing the MS patients’ resilience.
