ObjectiveThis article examines whether family resilience can be enhanced among military families via an online prevention program for military couples at the transition to parenthood.BackgroundMilitary families experience normative stressors similar to those of civilian families, as well as military‐specific stressors, such as deployment, frequent moves, and uncertainty.MethodParticipants were 56 heterosexual couples who, at the time of recruitment, were expecting their first child and were living together (regardless of marital status). Mothers and fathers completed measures online: Pretest was administered upon recruitment during pregnancy, and posttest was administered at 6 months postpartum. After pretest, couples were randomized to control and intervention conditions; intervention couples were provided access to the online version of Family Foundations.ResultsAlthough outcomes require replication given the sample size and issues with attrition, results indicated significant program impact, with moderate to strong effect sizes, on parent depression, mothers' report of coparenting support, and infant mood and soothability.ConclusionThese results suggest online delivery of prevention programming is a potentially effective means of enhancing military family well‐being—and thus resilience.ImplicationsLow‐cost and effective support for military families is possible via online modalities.
