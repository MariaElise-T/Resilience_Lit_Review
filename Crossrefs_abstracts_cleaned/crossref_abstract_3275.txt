The statistical significance was found for HADS depression score (t=-0.31; p=0.000), HADS anxiety (t=-1.07, p=0.002) and psychological resilience (t=-0.23, p=0.001) in terms of life satisfaction levels of patients treated with testicular cancer. There was no statistical significance found among other variables and life satisfaction levels of patients (p>0.005).
