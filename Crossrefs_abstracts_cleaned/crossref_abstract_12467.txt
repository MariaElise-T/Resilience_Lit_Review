Abstract
Plant architecture modification (e.g. short-stature crops) is one of the key outcomes of modern crop breeding for high-yielding crop varieties. In cereals, delayed senescence, or stay-green, is an important trait that enables post-anthesis drought stress adaptation. Stay-green crops can prolong photosynthetic capacity during grain-filling period under post-anthesis drought stress, which is essential to ensure grain yield is not impacted under drought stress conditions. Although various stay-green quantitative trait loci have been identified in cereals, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating stay-green remain elusive. Recent advances in various gene-editing technologies have provided avenues to fast-track crop improvement, such as the breeding of climate-resilient crops in the face of climate change. We present in this viewpoint the focus on using sorghum as the model cereal crop, to study PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers as means to modulate plant architecture, and the potential to employ it as an adaptive strategy to address the environmental challenges posed by climate uncertainties.
