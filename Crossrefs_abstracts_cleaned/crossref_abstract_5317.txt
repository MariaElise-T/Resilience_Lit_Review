Taking Zhejiang power market as the research object, this article compares the spot market, medium and long-term market and auxiliary service market models in Zhejiang Province with reference to the theories and practical experiences related to the construction of power market at home and abroad. Combining the situation of Zhejiang Province, the network situation and the current situation of power market construction, a multi-period generation dispatch optimization model based on power contract is proposed, and a day-ahead market clearing model adapted to distributed energy participation is established. Based on the deep learning algorithm using simulation cases of multiple scenarios, the power market model under the multi-fusion high resilience grid form is designed to provide suggestions for the design of generation dispatch optimization model and settlement mechanism for different power market development stages.
