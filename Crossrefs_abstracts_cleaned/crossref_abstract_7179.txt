This study analyses the vulnerabilities, opportunities and urban resilience and social cohesion awareness that emerged in Adana province in the face of the mass migration movement towards Adana province after the civil war that started in Syria in 2011. In this respect, we will first try to make conceptual fixations on resilience awareness. After explaining the historical origin and evolution of the concept, we will address the issue of putting the issue on the agenda of our country and municipalities at the local level. Afterwards, we plan to make use of the Migration Master Plan prepared by Adana Metropolitan Municipality with the perspective of increasing urban resilience against migration and establishing resilience.
Based on these points, we would like to summarize the study under three main headings. In the introduction section, we will try to reveal the political and historical background of the issue at the scale of Adana. In the first section, we will discuss the issue of urban resilience in the face of migration by making conceptual fixations. In the second section, we will try to understand the impact of Syrian migration on the city in Adana. In the third part, we will discuss the vulnerabilities and opportunities set out in the Migration Master Plan prepared by Adana Metropolitan Municipality and discuss the problems, targets and solution vision. The study will conclude with a general evaluation on the subject.
