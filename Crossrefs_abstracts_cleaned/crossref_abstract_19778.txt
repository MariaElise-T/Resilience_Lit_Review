ABSTRACT  Objective: To unveil the resilience process in family caregivers of people with malignant neoplasia.  Method: Descriptive and qualitative research performed between September and November of 2017 in a Brazilian Unit of High Complexity Care in Oncology. Individual interviews and four focus groups were conducted with 29 family caregivers. Socio-constructivist methodology was used under Vygotsky's perspective, the theoretical framework of the construction of the resilience processes, besides the hybrid model of thematic analysis.  Results: Three thematic categories emerged: "feelings revealed through colors"; "practice of care and communication in the process of resilience" and "faith and hope in the process of resilience". The family caregivers organized themselves to provide support to their family member with malignant neoplasia and they faced, in a more consolidated way, the overwhelming transformations imposed by the disease.  Conclusion and implications for practice: The guidelines made by health professionals were paramount in the process of family caregivers' resilience, in addition to emotional support and spirituality. The communication with health professionals is essential in the coping of family caregivers when dealing with problems or conflicts, since there is better conduction in the process of illness of the loved one, when there is greater knowledge and understanding of the disease.
