This study explores the lived experiences of Israeli parents of transgender young adults, depicting gender diversity as a family‐relational phenomenon. The analysis of 18 in‐depth, semi‐structured interviews with Israeli parents of trans young adults suggests that the parents’ experiences were characterized by a dialectic between feelings of vulnerability and resilience. The parents’ vulnerability was shaped by their social positioning as a minority group as well as their socio‐political environment, and their ability to cope with these hardships enhanced their resilience. As the parents developed their resilience through meaning‐making, social support, and activism, they gained a new sense of agency alongside a deep sense of vulnerability, suggesting that vulnerability and resilience are not objective, opposite binaries but rather fluid categories that are continually constructed through the intersection of micro‐ and macro‐level factors.
