SummaryIn this paper, the resilient consensus strategy design problem is investigated for the time‐varying state‐saturated multiagent systems (MASs). A round‐robin protocol is adopted to schedule the communication network among the MASs for the purpose of preventing the data from collision. In presence of the state‐saturation and gain perturbation phenomena, it is literally impossible to obtain the accurate value of the associate cost function, which describes the consensus performance. As an alternative, an upper bound is derived for the cost function to quantify the consensus performance. Then, the resilient consensus strategy is designed such that this upper bound can be minimized in an iterative manner. The sufficient condition is also provided to guarantee that the upper bound of the cost function exists as time goes to infinity. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed methodology.
