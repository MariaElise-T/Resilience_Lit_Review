Vicarious resilience (VR) is defined as the positive effects caregivers experience within their personal lives, their work lives, and within their worldview as a whole, that come from witnessing the resilience that clients demonstrate in facing their traumatic experiences. This research study is a quasi-experimental pilot study about how solution focused brief therapy (SFBT) influences the vicarious resilience of family protective system (SLIM) workers in Bolivia. The Vicarious Resilience Inventory (VRI) was administered in a pretest/posttest design for an experimental group (applying SFBT) and a control group (training as usual). Both groups experienced an increase in vicarious resilience, but the SFBT group experienced statistically significant improvements on three subscales of the VRI; (a) resourcefulness, (b) recognition of spirituality, and (c) self-awareness. Two other subscales of the VRI neared statistical significance for the SFBT group, client inspired hope and consciousness of power. It is anticipated that with a larger sample size these subscales would also have been statistically significant. Additional research is needed to generalize the results of this pilot study to a larger population.
