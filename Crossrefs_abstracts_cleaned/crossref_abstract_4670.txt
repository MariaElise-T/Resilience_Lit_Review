 Asperger's disorder (AD) is characterized by sustained and pervasive difficulties with imaginative, social, and communication skills and the presence of repetitive interests and behaviours. A number of models have been proposed to help explain the AD phenotype; however, these theories have not fully accounted for the social difficulties present in individuals with AD. The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) may offer insight into the social and emotional behaviours exhibited by young adults with AD. In addition, the concept of resilience, or the capacity for individuals to cope despite risk, may further explain why some individuals with AD experience more successful outcomes than others. This study explores EI and resilience in 20 males diagnosed with AD with average to above-average cognitive abilities. Various aspects of social functioning, EI, and resilience were assessed. Results indicate that males with AD displayed intact ability EI; however, they did not display typically developed trait EI. Furthermore, trait EI was associated with important resilient and adaptive outcomes, and these findings provide opportunities for intervention. It is important that through the identification of factors that compose resilient outcomes, this research represents the first step in identifying interventions designed to strengthen protective factors within young adults diagnosed with AD.
