Exposure to war, conflict and forced migration puts children at risk of mental health problems. The present study examined the levels of psychological distress and resilience factors among 106 Palestinian refugee children aged 11 to 17 in the West Bank. In a cross-sectional, mixed method design along with qualitative interviews, three questionnaires were administered: the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Patient Health Questionnaire-15, assessed the risk of mental health disorders and psychosomatic complaints, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure assessed the availability of resilience-enhancing factors. Palestinian refugee children were found to be at greater risk for mental disorders and psychosomatic complaints than were children living in non-conflict affected settings. In addition, resilience-enhancing resources were significantly reduced and were negatively correlated with both symptom outcomes. Risk factors identified included poverty, violence and marginalisation. Key protective factors were youth education, supportive relationships and social participation. Our findings support interventions that address the identified protective factors, which may promote the mental health of this vulnerable population.
