OBJECTIVES:  To determine whether positive self‐perceived oral health is associated with sociodemographic health variables, with an emphasis on resilience, in community‐dwelling older adults in southern Brazil.DESIGN:  Cross‐sectional study nested within a cohort study.SETTING:  Carlos Barbosa in southern Brazil.PARTICIPANTS:  Four hundred ninety‐six community‐dwelling adults aged 64 and older.MEASUREMENTS:  Sociodemographic information, a health history, and health perceptions were assessed using a structured questionnaire. Resilience was assessed using a resilience scale. For each participant, a brief oral examination was performed to assess number of teeth. Positive self‐perceived oral health was the outcome of interest.RESULTS:  A final, fully adjusted Poisson regression model showed that high resilience potential (prevalence ratio (PR)=1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06–1.32), income (PR=1.18, 95% CI=1.07–1.30), and no reported change in diet because of dental problems (PR=1.34, 95% CI=1.13–1.60) were associated with positive self‐perceived oral health. Participants living in rural areas were less likely to report positive self‐perceived oral health (PR=0.83, 95% CI=0.75–0.93).CONCLUSION:  Using a hierarchical approach, positive self‐perceived oral health was found to be associated with several variables included in the conceptual framework of oral health outcomes, such as resilience. Resilience may act as a potentiating agent in the positive adaptation to tooth loss.
