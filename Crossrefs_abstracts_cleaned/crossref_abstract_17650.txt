Childhood neglect has a lifelong negative impact on the individual's physical health and well-being and is a risk for psychopathology. The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between child neglect, resilience, social support, and well-being. Data were collected from 450 women. A structural equation model was designed and tested to determine the correlations between the variables affecting well-being. The results revealed that the more women were neglected during childhood, the lower they perceived social support and the lower their resilience and well-being. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between resilience and well-being, whereas there was no significant relationship between social support and well-being. The findings show that neglect directly affects well-being in adulthood in the negative direction.
