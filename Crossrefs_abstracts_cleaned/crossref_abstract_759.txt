 The study investigates the relations of resiliency and posttraumatic growth among people who experienced a death of someone close. The results of 74 participants, mostly women (63.5%) who completed a series of questionnaires measuring resiliency and posttraumatic growth were analyzed. The age of respondents ranged from 21 to 74 years ( M = 38.4; SD = 15.5). The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun and The Resiliency Assessment Scale by Ogińska-Bulik and Juczynski were used in the study. Results revealed positive association between resiliency and posttraumatic growth, particularly with increased self-perception and appreciation of life. However, the results of the study indicate that the relationship between the variables is complex and not all dimensions of resiliency increase the level of changes aftermath trauma.
