Background:
Understanding the factors that influence resilience is especially important in the context of emotionally demanding work environments in health care. The aim of this study is to examine the associations between Type D personality and resilience among nursing students.


Method:

              A correlational study design was used, and 150 baccalaureate nursing students participated. The Type D personality subscale, sense of coherence questionnaire, and Baruth protective factors inventory were used. Linear regression analysis and Student's
              t
              tests were used.
            


Results:
The negative affectivity subscale of the Type D scale was a significant predictor for resilience and sense of coherence. Students with high levels of Type D characteristics had significantly lower levels of resilience and sense of coherence.


Conclusion:

              It would be beneficial to include specific interventions for decreasing negative affectivity and promoting stress coping skills training in the training programs in nursing school curricula. [
