Extensive efforts have been made in preparedness and restorative action to mitigate impacts on critical water sector services from extreme events, such as storms, earthquakes, and terrorism. Comparatively, with some exceptions, the more gradual, slow-moving consequences associated with climate change have garnered lower priority in decision-making processes. This research focuses on surface- and ground- water source contamination by elevated chloride levels, which is a common climate-induced effect. Historic and current response actions by water utilities to address elevated chloride levels were analyzed based on a literature review and interviews with water utility professionals. Key lessons and findings were selected to highlight the operational challenges, solutions implemented, and the adaptive measures considered to improve community water supply resilience.
