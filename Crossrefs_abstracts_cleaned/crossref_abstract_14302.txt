This study presents a methodology to assess transport network resilience to urban flooding. The proposed methodology is developed based on the centrality measures and graph theory. The study utilises Open-Source GIS tools to compute betweenness and closeness centrality values. The case study was carried out in Greater Colombo - Sri Lanka, with reference to three significant urban flooding events in 2010, 2016, and 2017. The study assessed the resilience of road network in terms of topological impacts and accessibility changes.The results revealed three key findings. First, over 60% of road network revealed a significant change in its topological structural coherence during each flooding event. This was particularly pronounced in vehicular movements relative to pedestrian movements. Second, the study revealed a redundant depreciation of the transport accessibility as it shifted from city centre to peripheral areas creating temporary accessibility hotpots in the periphery. Third, a significant drawback of the resilience of road network was identified in terms of the deviation from the shortest path, increasing the travel time and trip length. In overall, the study concluded that the proposed methodology can be utilised as a planning and designing tool to assess road network`s resilience devising precautionary measures to mitigate disaster risk.
