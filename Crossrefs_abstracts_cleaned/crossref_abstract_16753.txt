 This study aimed to determine the correlation between spirituality, religious attitude, and resilience with death anxiety in cardiovascular patients in Sanandaj, Iran. This study was conducted on 414 cardiovascular patients, who were selected by convenience sampling method. Demographic information forms, Spiritual Well Being Scale, Golriz and Burhani’s Religious Attitude, Connor-Davidson Resilience Questionnaire, and Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale were used to collect data. Results indicated that compared to urban areas, living in rural areas significantly increased the average score of death anxiety by 0.55 points ( p = 0.026). Additionally, a one-unit increase in religious attitude and resilience significantly reduced the mean score of death anxiety by 0.05 ( p = 0.003) and 0.13 ( p <0.001) on average, respectively. Spearman rank correlation indicated that religious attitudes and resilience were inversely and significantly correlated with death anxiety. Therefore, providing counseling sessions with psychologists and clergy seems necessary for a favorable change in the state of death anxiety in these patients.
