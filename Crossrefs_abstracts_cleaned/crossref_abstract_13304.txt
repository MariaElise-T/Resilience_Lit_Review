AbstractUnderstanding and accurately measuring resilience among Chinese civil aviation pilots is imperative, especially concerning the psychological impact of distressing events on their well-being and aviation safety. Despite the necessity, a validated and tailored measurement tool specific to this demographic is absent. Addressing this gap, this study built on the widely used CD-RISC-25 to analyze and modify its applicability to Chinese civil aviation pilots. Utilizing CD-RISC-25 survey data from 231 Chinese pilots, correlational and differential analyses identified items 3 and 20 as incongruent with this population's resilience profile. Subsequently, factor analysis derived a distinct two-factor resilience psychological framework labeled “Decisiveness” and “Adaptability”, which diverged from the structure found in American female pilots and the broader Chinese populace. Additionally, to further accurately identify the measurement characteristics of this 2-factor measurement model, this study introduced Generalized Theory and Item Response Theory, two modern measurement analysis theories, to comprehensively analyze the overall reliability of the measurement and issues with individual items. Results showed that the 2-factor model exhibited high reliability, with generalizability coefficient reaching 0.89503 and dependability coefficient reaching 0.88496, indicating the 2-factor measurement questionnaire can be effectively utilized for relative and absolute comparison of Chinese civil aviation pilot resilience. However, items in Factor 2 provided less information and have larger room for optimization than those in Factor 1, implying item option redesign may be beneficial. Consequently, this study culminates in the creation of a more accurate and reliable two-factor psychological resilience measurement tool tailored for Chinese civil aviation pilots, while exploring directions for optimization. By facilitating early identification of individuals with lower resilience and enabling the evaluation of intervention efficacy, this tool aims to positively impact pilot psychological health and aviation safety in the context of grief and trauma following distressing events.
