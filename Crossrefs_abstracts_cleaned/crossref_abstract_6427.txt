AbstractWith the increased number of multi-storey buildings in seismic areas, research efforts have been focused on developing earthquake resilient systems, such as low-damage techniques based on the combination of post-tensioning and dissipating devices. This paper describes the experimental study performed on a 3-storey post-tensioned timber framed (Pres-Lam) building equipped with energy dissipating systems. The testing project consisted of three phases adopting different configurations of the experimental model: (1) post-tensioning to beam-column joints only, (2) post-tensioning and dissipative rocking mechanisms and (3) post-tensioning and dissipative braces. The main objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate on the seismic response of a large-scale specimen with dissipative braces located in high seismic area, considering construction details similar to those adopted in practical applications. During the experimental campaign, the test frame was subjected to more than one hundred ground motions considering a set of seven spectra-compatible earthquakes at increasing intensity levels. The dissipating bracing system with external replaceable hysteretic dampers improves the seismic resilience of multi-storey Pres-Lam buildings, showing inter-storey drift comparable to those with rocking walls, with full recentring capability and without structural damages or post-tensioning losses through seismic tests.
