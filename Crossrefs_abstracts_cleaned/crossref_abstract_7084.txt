Abstract
To make concrete columns with drift-hardening behavior and small residual deformation, a simple method is proposed. The method is the use of ultra-high-strength (UHS) PC wire strands as longitudinal reinforcements of concrete columns. The effectiveness of the method has been verified by experiments. The purpose of this paper is to present an analytical method for simulating seismic behavior of resilient high-strength concrete columns reinforced by PC strands, based on reliable constitutive laws of the PC strands and the concrete. Five square concrete columns with the cross-section of 250mm Ã— 250mm, the height of 1000 mm, the shear span ratio of 2.0, the axial load ratio of 0.25 and compressive cubic strength of 95 MPa were fabricated and tested. The experimental results were compared with the results predicted by the analytical method. Comparisons indicate that the proposed method can predict the development trend and feature points of the envelop curve of the columns until large deformation. Comparisons also indicate that the calculated flexural capacities by the proposed method show very good agreement with the test results. Utilizing the proposed method and the current design code, which are used to evaluate the ultimate flexure and shear capacities, respectively, can give a reasonable evaluation of the failure mode of concrete columns.
