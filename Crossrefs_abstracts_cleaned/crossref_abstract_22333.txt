 This paper introduces the results of an evaluation of the Forum-theatre workshop method, which was designed within the framework of a resilience-building intervention. About 230 in-service vocational school teachers in Canton of Ticino participated in the study. A mixed-methods research design was applied to investigate potentialities of the Forum-theatre technique in generating a better understanding about interpersonal conflicts at school while fostering active coping strategies. Data were collected by means of participatory observation and a self-reported questionnaire. The findings indicate a perceived positive impact in terms of proactive participation, critical awareness and activated reflectivity. In addition, the interactive drama technique encouraged participants to activate a dialog between multiple perspectives, thus enlarging the perceived spectrum of possible actions during relational conflicts. The paper concludes with implications for creativity and resilience research.
