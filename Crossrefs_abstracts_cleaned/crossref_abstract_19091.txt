A single mother has to face quite complicated conditions, especially for children with special needs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many activities have changed due to large-scale social restrictions in Jakarta and its surroundings, including studying and teaching. All educational activities are conducted online. Single mothers have to consider fulfilling their childrenâ€™s needs while dealing with their children doing online school.  This qualitative research uses a phenomenological study of four single mothers as participants with special needs children aged 15-22 years who struggle to raise them. This study shows that mothers have strong resilience because they adapt to conditions and need support from family, friends, and the environment.
