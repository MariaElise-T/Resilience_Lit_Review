Background
Resilience is important for patients with cancer. However, the relationships among factors affecting the resilience of patients with lung cancer have not been studied sufficiently.


Objective
The aim of this study was to clarify the relationships among social support, resilience, self-efficacy, and symptom distress among patients with lung cancer.


Methods
Through simple random sampling, 303 patients with lung cancer from 4 tertiary hospitals in Changsha, China, were recruited for a cross-sectional descriptive correlational survey. Data were collected using demographic and disease-related information, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Strategies Used by People to Promote Health, the Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Symptom Distress Scale.


Results
Patients’ mean total resilience score was 50.01 ± 15.25. The fit indices for the model indicated a good fit. Social support had multiple effects on resilience; specifically, it had direct and indirect effects through the mediating role of self-efficacy. Symptom distress had only an indirect effect on resilience through self-efficacy.


Conclusions
Social support, symptom distress, and self-efficacy are key factors associated with resilience in patients with lung cancer. These factors had direct and indirect effects on each other and on resilience.


Implications for Practice
To enhance resilience among patients with lung cancer, interventions that strengthen self-efficacy, provide social support, and reduce symptom distress should be developed.
