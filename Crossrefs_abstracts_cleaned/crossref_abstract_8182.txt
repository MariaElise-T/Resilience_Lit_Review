This study was conducted to determine whether there is a mediator role between burnout and psychological distress in medical students. The selection of subjects was carried out using a quota sample and measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory â€“ SS (MBI-SS), The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) 10. The data obtained were normal and analyzed using the correlation in SPSS 23 for windows to check the relationship between variables which was followed by mediation analysis using PROCESS macros for SPSS. From the results of the analysis it is known that the relationship issued is partial mediation. Even though there is no resilience as a mediator, burnout and psychological distress variables have a positive and significant relationship in medical students.
