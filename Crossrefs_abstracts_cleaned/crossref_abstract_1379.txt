 With support from Public Safety Canada’s Cyber Security Cooperation Program, HealthCare CAN and the Digital Governance Council developed a new standard to support cyber resiliency in Canada’s healthcare system. With a clear framework and enhanced cybersecurity capabilities, healthcare organizations will be better protected from cybercrime, allowing them to respond more effectively to evolving threats and defend critical infrastructure. Health and information technology leaders can derive practical guidance and next steps from this three-year national project to enhance cyber resilience and improve safety within their organizations.
