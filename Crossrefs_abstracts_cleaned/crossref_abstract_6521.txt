			<p>Due to climate change and human activities, ecological and environmental issues have become increasingly prominent and it is crucial to deeply study the coordinated development between human activities and the ecological environment. Combining panel data from 31 provinces in China spanning from 2011 to 2020, we employed a fixed-effects model, a threshold regression model, and a spatial Durbin model to empirically examine the intricate impacts of population agglomeration on ecological resilience. Our findings indicate that population agglomeration can have an impact on ecological resilience and this impact depends on the combined effects of agglomeration and crowding effects. Also, the impact of population agglomeration on ecological resilience exhibits typical dual-threshold traits due to differences in population size. Furthermore, population agglomeration not only directly impacts the ecological resilience of the local area, but also indirectly affects the ecological resilience of surrounding areas. In conclusion, we have found that population agglomeration does not absolutely impede the development of ecological resilience. On the contrary, to a certain extent, reasonable population agglomeration can even facilitate the progress of ecological resilience.</p>
