 Norwegian schools are obliged to develop students’ social competences. Programs used are School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) or classroom-based ones that aim to teach students social and emotional learning (SEL) skills in a broad sense. Some rating scales have been used to assess the effect of SEL programs on SEL skills. We explored the Norwegian version of the 12-item Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales–Child–Short Form (SEARS-C-SF). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed, proposing a one-factor solution that was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale reliability of .84 (λ2), means and standard deviations, as well as tier levels were compared with the original short form. Finally, concurrent, discriminant, and convergent validities for the SEARS-C-SF were compared with different Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) subscales.
