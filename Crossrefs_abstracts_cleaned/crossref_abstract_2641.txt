This  research  delves  into  the  critical  realm  of  space  applications  by  conducting  an  experimental  analysis  and investigation  into  the  effects  of  radiation  on  integrated  circuits.  As  space  missions  become  more  advanced  and extended, the resilience of electronic components, particularly integrated circuits, to radiation becomes paramount. Through  rigorous  experimentation,  this  study  aimsto  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  impact  of  radiation  on integrated  circuits  and  pave  the  way  for  the  development  of  more  robust  and  reliable  technologies  for  space exploration.
