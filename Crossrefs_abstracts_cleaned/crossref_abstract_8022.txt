AbstractThe synchronization stability has been analyzed as one of the important dynamical characteristics of power grids. In this study, we bring the operational perspective to the synchronization stability analysis by counting not only full but also partial synchronization between nodes. To do so, we introduce two distinct measures that estimate the operational resilience of power-grid nodes: functional secureness centrality and functional robustness centrality. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the measures in a model network motif and an IEEE test power grid. As a case study of German power grid, we reveal that the modular structure of a power grid and particular unidirectional current flow determine the distribution of the operational resilience of power-grid nodes. Reproducing our finding on clustered benchmark networks, we validate the modular effect on power grid stability and confirm that our measures can be the insightful tools to understand the power gridsâ€™ synchronization dynamics.
