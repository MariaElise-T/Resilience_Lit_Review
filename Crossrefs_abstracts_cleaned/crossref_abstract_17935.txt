Abstract
A cascading disaster, which follows from an earthquake disaster, can result in a significant share of losses, in addition to the losses from the earthquake disaster itself. The scientific community acknowledges the necessity for theoretical and practical advancements on cascade events to give the information required for disaster management in the field, especially related to infrastructure resilience. This study aims to evaluate the resilience of residential buildings to cascading earthquake threats using a geological approach. Using spatial multi-criteria analysis of land instability based on geological approach and cascading disasters, the evaluation of building types based on earthquake resistance and cascading disasters was conducted. The south coast of Sukabumi Regency was used as the study site. The findings indicate that practically all structures in areas prone to cascading disasters are very susceptible to this hazard. Therefore, it is vital to arrange cascading disaster-prone areas and infrastructures utilizing the concept of mitigation and adaptation-based spatial planning.
