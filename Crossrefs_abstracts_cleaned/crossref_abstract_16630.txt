As rural areas in developing countries are generally more vulnerable to disasters triggered by natural hazards than urban areas, it has become critical to strengthen rural community disaster resilience (CDR) to reduce the risks. Using follow‐up interviews, surveys, and secondary data, this study reviewed the Safe Rural Community (SRC) programme implemented by the One Foundation, a Chinese civilian non‐governmental organisation (NGO), after the 2013 Lushan earthquake in China. The study focused on five key resilience aspects: networks; infrastructure; institutions; capacity; and culture. It found that the SRC programme successfully developed five standardised, systematic, interrelated, and practical elements: localised volunteer rescue teams; adequate emergency supplies; practical disaster reduction training; community emergency plans; and regular emergency rescue drills. Third‐party evaluations and a 2022 Lushan earthquake test revealed that this NGO‐led, community‐based, and team‐oriented initiative had been effective. Consequently, the study provides some guidance for the development of effective CDR programmes in rural communities in developing countries.
