Abstract In the present perspective, some parallels are drawn between a career as a scientist in Brazil and the ability of microorganisms to form a biofilm. Do these connections really exist? Definitely the answer is YES. Over billions of years, microbial biofilms have evolved in order to form a cohesive, well-structured, organized and dynamic community, which is characterized by its resistant/resilient profile to several environmental stressors. Adapting to constant change is a necessary attribute for survival and perpetuation of all live organisms, which are key signatures present in the hereditary molecule. Brazilian scientists are faced with many stressful situations along their journey in academia, which requires constant adaptability, reorganization and, above all, resilience. Can we take some lessons from what we know about the biofilm lifestyle developed by microorganisms? The answer is yes!
