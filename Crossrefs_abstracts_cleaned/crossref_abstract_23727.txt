Aerospace vehicle navigation systems are equipped with multi-source redundant navigation sensors. According to the characteristics of the above navigation system configuration, building a resilient navigation framework to improve the accuracy and robustness of the navigation system has become an urgent problem to be solved. In the existing integrated navigation methods, redundant information is only used for backup. So, it cannot use the redundant navigation information to improve the accuracy of the navigation system. In this paper, a resilient multi-source fusion integrated navigation method based on comprehensive information evaluation has been proposed by combining of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis in information theory. Firstly, this paper proposes a multi-layer evaluation framework of redundant information and carries out quantitative analysis of redundant information with the information disorder analysis theory to improve the reliability of the navigation system. Secondly, a navigation output effectiveness evaluation system has been established to analyze the output of heterogeneous navigation subsystems qualitatively to improve the fusion accuracy. Finally, through the mutual correction of multi-level information evaluation results, the error decoupling between the output parameters of heterogeneous navigation sensors has been realized to improve the robustness of the system. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can adaptively allocate and adjust the weight of navigation information at all levels, realize the “non-stop” work of the navigation system and enhance the resilient of the navigation architecture. The navigation accuracy is improved compared with the existing multi-source fusion algorithm, which reflects the reliability and robustness of this algorithm.
