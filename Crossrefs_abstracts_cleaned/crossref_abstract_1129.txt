 During August–September 2013, this research was conducted in two sites of World Vision India’s GRACE Project that specialize in providing care and support to children/adolescents (ages 11–19) impacted by HIV/AIDS in Chennai.1 This qualitative report presents the findings alongside a literature review that focuses on building resiliency upon the “innate capacities” of children/adolescents impacted by HIV/AIDS towards psychosocial, vocational, and spiritual flourishing. In order to better understand the ways in which programs can respond to the true needs of this demographic, the interviews and focus groups were framed with a participatory grassroots approach to discover unique challenges, future dreams, and existing capabilities.2 This study addresses the nature of resiliency in transformational development by exploring its engagement with the interlocking dimensions of well-being in four sections: 1) framing immediate needs and integrated programming, 2) social support and the role of kinship in transformational development, 3) enhancing vocational resiliency through participatory development, and 4) identity reformation and redeemed relationships within the Kingdom of God.
