For decades qualitative researchers have used grounded theory methodologies in their investigations. Although the grounded theory literature is extensive, less well documented are qualitative studies which incorporate complementary grounded theory approaches into their designs; or studies that validate the use of grounded theory strategies for applied research projects. This paper seeks to add to both margins of the grounded theory literature. First, it provides a detailed methodological account of how constructivist grounded theory and grounded theory situational analysis were used in a Ph.D. study exploring how ecologically concerned networks understand community resilience and respond to current and anticipated challenges of the Anthropocene, the idea that humans are now the primary influencers of global environmental changes. This account is based on a constructivist grounded theory analysis of nine interviews with Europeans active in the Transition Network at the community or regional level; and a grounded theory situational analysis of the networkâ€™s written discourse based on twenty-two English-language texts produced by prominent Transitioners, such as founders, headquarters staff, or national hub teams. Furthermore, while the wider Ph.D. study focused on theory building, analysis activities yielded practical insights into addressing real world problems, such as creating and sustaining collective action at the local level. Hence, the paper also discusses a framework that neighborhoods, towns, or other types of communities could adapt for their own collective purposes.
