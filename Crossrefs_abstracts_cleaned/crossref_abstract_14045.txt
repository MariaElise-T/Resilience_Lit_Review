Abstract
Floods are the impact of changes from a large-scale destructive environmental problem. The combination of population and climate change puts pressure on the challenges of sustainable urban development. The resilience of cities has a relationship with the value of urban sustainability; thus, it will be involved in the social-economic-environmental fields, and looks at the impact of floods and the recovery efforts. The approach method used is mixed, with case study analysis in the form of exploration of flood disaster events. While the sample was taken at the location of Depok City, West Java. There are various fields forming resilience, which are community accessibility, poverty level, carrying capacity of the water environment. Urban resilience is needed in every region to withstand disturbances to the recovery and reconstruction phases to restore the function of the urban system to normal. So this paper is intended to find the relationship between the elements that make up urban flood resilience.
