Owing to frequent tectonic activities, the Lembang Fault area in Java Island is highly vulnerable to disasters. Encompassing 51 villages along the fault, this region has witnessed rapid economic growth, transforming it into a sought-after tourist destination. The objective of this research is to map the levels of economic activity in the area and offer recommendations for sustainable economic development. The methodology employed encompasses data collection, in-depth interviews with agencies, business stakeholders, and developers, literature review, and research analysis. The findings of this study indicate that the areas situated along the fault corridor face significant disaster risks while exhibiting substantial economic activity. By utilizing recommendation maps and insights gleaned from interviews, it is determined that the most suitable area for further development lies on the north side of the Lembang Fault corridor. This research strives to provide valuable recommendations for future studies concerning economic sustainability in disaster-prone areas, specifically focusing on the Lembang Fault area. It contributes to enhancing our understanding of economic resilience in vulnerable regions and emphasizes the critical role of sustainable economic development in mitigating disaster risks.
