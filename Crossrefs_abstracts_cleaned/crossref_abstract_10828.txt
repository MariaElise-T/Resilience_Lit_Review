This article explores climate change resilience in the water sector, and its relation to food security of poor farmers in rural of Cambodia. The research analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data by conducting a survey of 103 farmer households in Svay Chacheb and Tuol Sala communes of Basedth District, Kampong Speu province. Detailed interviews were conducted with poor households, village chiefs, commune councilors, and agriculture officials at the district level. The study found that the famers do not receive sufficient water for rice cultivation and daily consumption from the existing irrigation systems and wetlands. Additionally, storage equipment and mechanisms for resilience to the effects of climate change are limited. Most farmers spend in order to obtain sufficient water for agriculture activities such as growing crops and raising livestock. The farmers need to borrow from their neighbors and use their own existing resources when they are faced with a food shortage because support mechanisms from government agencies and Non-governmental Organization (NGOs) are limited.
