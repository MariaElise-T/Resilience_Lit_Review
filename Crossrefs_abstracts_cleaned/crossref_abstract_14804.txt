AbstractIn this article, the resilient leaderless consensus problem for a multi‐agent system (MAS) under denial‐of‐service(DoS) attack is investigated. The DoS attack is carried out with multiple strategies. The sufficient condition for MASs achieving consensus under multi‐mode DoS attack is developed. In order to actively alleviate the influence caused by the DoS attack, the MAS switches between normal and secure modes. Once a DoS attack occurs, the agents will switch into the secure mode with a lower open‐loop divergence rate. A dynamic event‐based consensus protocol is proposed, driving the MAS achieve consensus while saving communication resources effectively. Moreover, rigorous proof analysis demonstrates the Zeno‐free property of the developed dynamic event‐triggered mechanism. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.
