Abstract
Semarang city has been facing a severe landslide disaster due to climate change and rapid urbanization. Community resilience, in turn, is an indispensable aspect that may help the city to mitigate the greater risk of landslide. This research aimed to assess community resilience in the most frequent landslide hazardous area in Semarang, which is Sukorejo. This research employed a quantitative approach to measure the level of community resilience in the form of an index (scale of 0-1). As a proxy, there were four variables adopted in this study: psychological, social capital and demography, economic, and access to facilities. The result showed that the highest resilience level is in the aspect of social capital and demography (0.63), while the lowest is the economic aspect (0.43). The neighborhoods with higher economic scores are likely to have lower social capital and demography score; while they have a high score in the psychological aspect. The aggregate (regency level) community resilience score for Sukorejo is 0.58. This score attests that the community has reached a moderate level of resiliency; hence, it needs improvement, mostly in the aspect of economic welfare. Leveraging community resilience that comprises of improvement in economic readiness would be strategically vital.
