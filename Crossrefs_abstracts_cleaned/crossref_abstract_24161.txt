This article describes the reasons for creating a toolkit to study the energy system resilience using the capabilities of GIS technologies using the example of the Oil and Gas of Russia software package. A metamathematical model of the system and its division into main components, namely, topological and functional is described where the structural model reflects the topology of the power network in the form of a grap, and the functional model evaluates the performance taking into account both topological capabilities and functional constraints. Examples of the use of geographic information systems to aid in survivability research and the description of the requirements for developing tools for a new metamathematical model are considered. The architecture of the current "Oil and Gas of Russia" version, its features and problems that influenced the development of the new toolkit are described. The reasons for the use and features of the QT API during the development of the toolkit are given. The new toolkit assumes the use of the Model-View-Controller architecture, which allows you to modify each component independently of the other. This architecture also helps to decouple the topological and functional components by encapsulating the topological model in the form of a separate graph, and to use a controller to communicate with the functional component. This makes it possible to use different types of functional models without the need to change the topological model. Each functional model uses its own controller which sets complex of the country as a whole. Thus, the proposed changes to the "Oil and Gas of Russia" complex will make it possible to move in the study of resilience from modeling individual power plants to the fuel and energy.
