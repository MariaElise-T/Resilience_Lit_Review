Abstract
The resilience of power distribution networks to extreme weather is becoming more and more concerning. A novel resilience evaluation method for distribution networks under icy weather is proposed in this paper. According to the analysis of factors affecting the distribution networks, two sets of resilience index systems are constructed. Based on the line fault probability model under icy weather, the typical weather scenarios are chosen by k-means clustering. The valuable fault scenarios are selected depending on the information entropy. To analyse the resilience of different distribution network structures, a preventive reconfiguration measure is considered in the evaluation process. Simulating results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience evaluation method.
