 Pavement design based on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil has been adopted by many transportation agencies following the recommendations of the AASHTO guide for design of pavement structures. Laboratory and field nondestructive tests are generally used to evaluate the resilient modulus of subgrade soil. These methods have shortcomings and limitations and are considered laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. The difficulties associated with the existing methods signify the need for a popular in situ technology for evaluating the resilient modulus of subgrade soil. Among other methods, the cone penetration test (CPT) is fast, simple, and economical and provides repeatable and reliable results. The results of a pilot investigation to assess the possibility of predicting the resilient modulus of subgrade soil from the CPT soundings are presented here. Field and laboratory testing programs were carried out on two types of cohesive soils at the Louisiana Transportation Research Center/Pavement Research Facility. Field tests consisted of CPT soundings using the 15-cm2 friction cone penetrometer and the 2-cm2 miniature friction cone penetrometer. Laboratory tests included the resilient modulus and physical properties of the investigated soils. The results of the miniature CPT were evaluated and compared with the soundings of the 15-cm2 cone at the same site. Both laboratory and field tests were analyzed. Based on statistical analyses, a model was proposed to estimate the resilient modulus from the CPT data and basic soil properties. Predicted values of the resilient modulus are consistent with laboratory measurements.
