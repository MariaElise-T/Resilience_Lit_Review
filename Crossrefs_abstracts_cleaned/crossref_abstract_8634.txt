 A stochastic model for fish recruitment is fitted to data after performing an age-structured stock assessment. The main aim is to investigate the relation between safe levels of spawning stock size and fish stock resilience. Resilience indicators, such as stock recovery time and the frequency that a stock is below a critical size, are computed by means of simulation using the fitted stochastic model. The stochastic element of the model describes the early life stage survival of the fish using a nonlinear stochastic Leslie type of matrix. From catch data and fishing mortality rates, the free parameters in the model are estimated by means of a maximum likelihood method. The performance of the maximum likelihood estimation method is tested by means of simulation. The method is applied to data of a halibut population (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Southeastern Bering Sea. It turns out that given the fluctuation in recruitment, data of at least 25 consecutive years are required.
