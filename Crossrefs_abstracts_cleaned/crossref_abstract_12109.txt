In terms of uncertain business conditions, the ability of an enterprise to bounce back after severe disruptions, or simply resilience, may be seen as one of the major features needed to sustain successful business operations. This research has the objective of proposing an algorithm for the organizational resilience assessment in industrial companies and conducting an analysis of the relationship between the organizational Resilience Factors and Key Performance Indicators recovery times. As the variables that are an integral part of the research are exposed to a high degree of uncertainty, they are modeled using fuzzy set theory. The methodology used for the research is an enhanced fuzzy Delphi, where the fuzzy geometric mean is employed as an aggregation operator. The relationship between the organizational resilience factors and Key Performance Indicatorsâ€™ recovery time is based on the correlation analysis. The proposed model is based on real data from one complex industrial enterprise. The main finding of the research is that calculations indicate a significant negative correlation between treated variables.
