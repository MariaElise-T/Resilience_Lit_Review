This paper aims to adapt the Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scale-Teacher Form (SEARS-T) into Turkish and to determine its validity and reliability. The sample of the study consisted of 430 students attending kindergarten and primary school grades 1-4. The standardized values, obtained as a result of the first-order confirmatory factor analysis (Χ²= 3.860.88 sd=773; RMSEA=.10; SRMR=.063; CFI=.98; NNFI=.97) and obtained as a result of the second-order confirmatory factor analysis (Χ²=3.895.94 sd=775; RMSEA=.10; SRMR=.063; CFI=.98; NNFI=.97), confirmed that the scale showed a four-factor structure in Turkish culture similar to its original structure. In order to provide evidence for the reliability of the scale, both Cronbach alpha values and item-test correlations were examined for the sub-dimensions and the total of the scale. According to the item test correlation, it was determined that the scale items served the purpose of measuring the feature to be measured. While Cronbach's alpha value was obtained as .982 for the whole scale, it was obtained as .950 for the responsibility sub-dimension, .953 for the social competence sub-dimension, .957 for the self-regulation sub-dimension, and .921 for the empathy sub-dimension. According to the Pearson Product Moments Correlation coefficient, the correlation coefficients between the sub-dimensions of the scale ranged from .70 to .85, and the sub-dimensions of the scale were found to have high and significant relationships with each other. In light of these findings, it has been revealed that SEARS-T-Turkish is a valid and reliable measurement tool for measuring the social and emotional skills of kindergarten and primary school children.
