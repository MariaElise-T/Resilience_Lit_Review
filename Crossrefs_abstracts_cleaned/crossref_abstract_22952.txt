AbstractBackgroundMany national studies have shown that nurses have a high turnover rate. The key to maintaining the stability of nursing staff is to explore the factors that affect their turnover intention; however, no research has been performed to explore the influencing factors and mechanisms of nurses' turnover intention based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour.AimBased on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, examining the relationships among resilience, job satisfaction, social support and turnover intention of nurses, a structural equation model was constructed to examine the mediating role of job satisfaction and social support between resilience and turnover intention.MethodsIn this descriptive cross‚Äêsectional study, a total of 350 questionnaires were distributed to participants from three tertiary hospitals in Changchun, Jilin Province, between December 2018 and March 2019.ResultsThe final model fits well. Job satisfaction and social support directly influences turnover intention. Resilience indirectly influences turnover intention through job satisfaction and social support.ConclusionTurnover intention is a complex variable, which is directly and indirectly affected by many factors. In this study, a new structural equation model was proposed, which laid a foundation for future longitudinal studies.
