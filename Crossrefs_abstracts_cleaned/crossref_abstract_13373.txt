The methodological value is explained from the application of two standardized tests with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89, made up of 102 variables in total; For this, an instrument composed of the self-efficacy section of the Schmeck learning styles inventory and the second the Merino positive psychological functioning scale was developed. I surveyed a total of 133 subjects. The statistical analyzes processed included the reliability and internal consistency test of the instrument; the selection of significant variables; descriptive analysis, measures of central tendency and variability; comparative analysis with Student's t test for independent samples, Pearson's correlation, integrational analysis from factorial and finally regression analysis. From the statistical results, it is highlighted that those students who lack a developed resilient ability have difficulty being selfeffective with respect to academic activities. Likewise, students who adequately reconcile their work, social and personal life, have high self-esteem, are creative, which allows them to be resilient and self-effective.
