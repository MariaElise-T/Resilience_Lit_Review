The carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals for China signify a critical time of energy transition in which energy resilience is a vital issue. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of urban energy system resilience (UESR) is important for establishing a theoretical foundation. To this end, in this paper, 309 Chinese cities were evaluated using a comprehensive UESR assessment framework composed of 113 indices that measured vulnerability and capabilities of resistance and restoration. The results showed that Chinaâ€™s UESR is distributed unevenly and that cities in the eastern region generally have higher resilience than those in other regions. The minimum and maximum UESR results corresponded to Tibet and Shandong, respectively, at the provincial level and Rikaze and Weifang, respectively, at the city level. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation among UESR, carbon dioxide emissions, and GDP.
