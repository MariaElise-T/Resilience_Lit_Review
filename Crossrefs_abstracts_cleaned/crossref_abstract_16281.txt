ABSTRACTIn this paper, we concentrate on the design of 1‐resilient Boolean functions with desirable cryptographic properties. Firstly, we put forward a novel secondary construction to obtain 1‐resilient functions. Next, we present the relationships between the properties of these constructed 1‐resilient functions and that of the initial functions. Based on the construction and a class of bent functions on n variables, we can obtain a class of (n + 3)‐variable 1‐resilient non‐separable cryptographic functions with a high algebraic immunity, whose nonlinearity is equal to the bent concatenation bound 2n + 2 − 2(n + 2)/2. Furthermore, we propose a set of 1‐resilient non‐separable functions on odd number of variables with an optimal algebraic degree, a high algebraic immunity, and a high nonlinearity.
