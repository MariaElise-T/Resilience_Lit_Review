 In this paper, a distributed observer-based resilient control scheme is proposed to solve the voltage regulation and current sharing problems of islanded direct current (DC) microgrids under actuator faults. First, an observer-based distributed fault estimation design is presented to estimate fault signals with high accuracy. Then, based on the estimated information, a primary decentralized fault-tolerant control layer is designed to ensure accurate voltage reference tracking. A secondary cooperative control layer is employed to achieve the goal of current sharing. Besides, both the fault estimation observers and the fault-tolerant controllers are designed in a plug-and-play fashion, which guarantees the scalability of the DC microgrid. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can efficiently improve the reliability and resilience of the DC microgrid.
