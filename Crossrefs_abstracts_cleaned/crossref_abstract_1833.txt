The current study examines the relationship between the cognitive state of participants [healthy-early mild cognitive impairment (MCI)â€“late MCI], some subjective wellbeing factors (positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning in life, accomplishment, and negative emotions), and negative psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress), as well as psychological resilience. We expected that people with advanced MCI would perceive increased negative psychological outcomes, poorer psychological resilience, and lower levels of subjective wellbeing in contrast to early MCI and healthy participants. The study involved 30 healthy, 31 early, and 28 late MCI individuals. A series of questionnaires have been applied to assess the aforementioned constructs. To examine the hypotheses of the study, path analysis (EQS program) was applied. Results showed that early MCI persons maintain the same levels of positive emotions and feelings of accomplishment with healthy peers. Late-stage patients present those feelings in a diminished form, which adversely impacts psychological resilience. Individuals with early and late MCI exhibit negative emotions and stress that impact their resilience; however, those with early MCI experience greater stress, negative emotions, depression, and anxiety. These findings may be utilized to design psychological interventions for resilience enhancement and support brain health in elderly adults who are at risk of neurodegeneration.
