 The use of natural river silt treated as a ‘waste material’ has become the focus of research in the Yellow River flooded area, especially in the field of highway engineering. It is therefore of great significance to study the deformation and stiffness degradation of Yellow River silt (YRS) under long-term cyclic loads. To this end, a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests on YRS for a large number of cycles (10 000) was carried out using a triaxial apparatus and the effects of confining pressure and cyclic stress ratio on the resilient strain of the YRS were explored. The critical cyclic stress and the critical cyclic stress ratio between the plastic shakedown state and incremental collapse state of the YRS were determined, and the modulus-softening behaviour of the YRS was assessed. The results of this study not only provide theoretical support for the long-term engineering performance of YRS, but also provide theoretical guidance for the cyclic response of all similar types of subgrade soils.
