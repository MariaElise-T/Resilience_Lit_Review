Psychological abuse as a form of domestic violence against working women is prevalent but underreported almost all over the world. The present study was conducted to examine the relationship between domestic psychological abuse and burnout, and how psychological resilience mediates between them. One thousand married teachers from private secondary schools were selected through purposive sampling. Study results demonstrated that there is a relationship between domestic psychological abuse against working women and burnout, and that psychological resilience has a positive supportive effect in overcoming depersonalization among these women, yet the study also showed a lack of significant intervention in the relationship between psychological abuse and depersonalization of working women. This study confirms the absence of total or partial mediation to address psychological abuse and depersonalization of working women.
