AbstractPurposeThis study explores the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Child and Youth Resilience Measure–Revised (CYRM‐R) in adolescent population.MethodA sample of 323 Iranian adolescents (12–18 years old) completed the CYRM‐R, Resilient Scale (RS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI‐II), and Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC‐SF). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the goodness of fit. Face, content, concurrent validity, and internal consistency were evaluated.ResultsThe results showed acceptable face and content validity. Goodness‐of‐fit was adequate and internal consistency (Cronbach's α exceeded .883) was strong. The CYRM‐R score correlated positively to the RS and MHC‐SF total score and negatively to the total score of BDI‐II, supporting the scale's concurrent validity. In addition, Factor analysis confirmed the two‐factor structure of this measure.ConclusionThe Persian version of the CYRM‐R presents adequate psychometric properties. It is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used to assess resilience in adolescents.
