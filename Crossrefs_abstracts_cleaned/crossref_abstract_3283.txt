Supply chain resilience is regarded as the ability of manufacturing organizations to maintain a high degree of environmental awareness and quickly reply and adapt after a disruption occurs. Supply chain resilience can ensure the complete structure and function of the supply chain system to the greatest extent while ensuring the continuity of information flow and logistics. The academic circles pay increasing attention to the research of supply chain resilience. However, the existing research mainly focuses on case analysis and phenomenon description, and the research conclusion lacks a theoretical and empirical basis. Hence, the present study uses the systematic review method to sort out the literature and analyses supply chain resilience research theory. Then, the development research background of supply chain resilience is discussed. This study will provide a theoretical framework and a basis for future empirical research and provide theoretical guidance for companies to build a resilient supply chain.
