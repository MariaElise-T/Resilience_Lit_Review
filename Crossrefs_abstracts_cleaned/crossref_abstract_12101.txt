The aim of the study is to construct a model of community resilience using the earthquake in Indonesia as a case study. Indonesia has problems with how the community prepares itself before, during, and after a disaster. The study employs exploratory focus group interviews with respondents grouped into communities from Central Sulawesi and West Java who were affected by the earthquake. The study reveals that there are clear gaps in the community response to the mitigation, preparation, and recovery of humanitarian disasters. There is a lack of disaster awareness, cooperation and coordination between the community and the local government, and the need for strategic steps before a disaster is one of the key findings from the interviews. This study provides a model of strategic mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery for the community so that the dynamics of the disaster management cycle can be understood, and lessons provided to improve their resilience in the case of future emergencies.
