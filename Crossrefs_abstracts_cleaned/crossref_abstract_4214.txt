This paper presents an investigation on the effects of flaky aggregates in asphalt mixture. In general, aggregate characteristics are critical to the performance of asphalt mixture. Therefore, flaky aggregate is normally avoided simply because it has significant contribution towards the gradation and reduces the interlocking characteristics of aggregates within asphalt mixture. In practice, it is recommended that the amount of flakiness aggregate should be limited to 25% or less. This study evaluates the mechanical properties of asphalt mixture specimens prepared with various percentages of flaky aggregates particularly 10%, 20% and 30% by the total weight of the mixture. Several laboratory tests were conducted including Marshall properties test, Indirect Tensile Modulus test and Dynamic Creep test. The results show that higher bitumen content is required with the increased in the amount of flaky aggregates added to mixture. Furthermore, greater amount of flaky aggregates tends to reduce the mixtureâ€™s resilient modulus and its resistance against permanent deformation.
