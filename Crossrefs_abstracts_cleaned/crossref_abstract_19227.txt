 Although highly related, mental illness may not fully determine perceived well-being, a distinction captured by dual-continuum models. Separating mental illness and well-being into related but separate constructs prompted investigation into potential buffers to reduce the impact of mental illness on perceived well-being. This study explored two such buffers in health literacy and psychological resilience among Australian men. Using the Ten to Men Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health, this secondary data analysis of n = 8,408 men between 18 and 60 years of age assessed the moderating effect of three components of health literacy (feeling supported by health care providers, ability to find health information, and active engagement with health care providers) and psychological resilience on the relationship between mental illness and well-being. Mental illness symptoms were negatively associated with well-being, whereas psychological resilience, active engagement with health care, and health care provider support (β res = .65, β eng = .28, and β sup = .25) had positive significant relationships with the outcome (all p ≤ .001). Ability to find health information ( p = .25) and psychological resilience ( p = .43) were not significantly associated with well-being. Of the four interactions tested, health literacy relating to health care worker support was the only significant moderator between mental illness and well-being (β sup = .03). This study identified that meaningful support and understanding from health care providers for Australian men aged between 18 and 60 years may somewhat ameliorate the impact of mental illness on well-being. Further related investigation may reveal specific interventions that improve perceptions of support among men.
