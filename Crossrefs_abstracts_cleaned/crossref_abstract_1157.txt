Abstract
Toxic stress (TS), resiliency-promoting factors (RPFs) and their interactions were investigated in relationship to incident dementia in a sample (n = 6516) of US adults ≥50 years old enrolled in the HRS between 2006-2016. TS included experiences of everyday discrimination and RPF included personal mastery. Race/ethnicity was self-reported as African American (AA), Caucasian, or Other. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated TS-, RPF- and race-associated hazard ratios (HR) for dementia diagnosis and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with adjustment for comorbidity and socio-demographic factors. Discrimination-associated risk of dementia diagnosis on average increased with education level [discrimination x education, p = 0.032; HR = 1.75 (95% CI: 1.01–3.03) if &lt; high school, HR = 5.67 (95% CI: 2.94–10.94) if high school completed and HR = 2.48 (95% CI: 1.53–4.00) if ≥some college education]. Likewise, AA vs. Caucasian race disparity in new-onset dementia was evident (HR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.42–3.17) among adults with high-mastery while absent (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.75–2.41) among adults with low mastery (Mastery x Race, p = 0.01). TS is a contextual driver of incident dementia that seemingly operates in a race and RPF-dependent manner. Heterogeneity pattern suggests that TS may overwhelm the cognitive reserve benefit of RPF particularly in status-inconsistent contexts including persons subjected to discrimination despite high education and in AA individuals despite high mastery. Policies that reduce discrimination and promote equitable treatment by race/ethnicity may support cognitive resiliency and reduce the risk of dementia diagnosis in adult Americans.
