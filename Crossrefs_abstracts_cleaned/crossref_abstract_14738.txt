Seismic resilience is a concept to evaluate the postearthquake functionality of structures that significantly play a critical role in postearthquake rescue and recovery. Indeed, the community is made up of more than just buildings; it is also made up of other subsystems such as hospital and school facilities as well as roads, drainage systems, sewer systems, and electrical power transmission networks. In recent years, the concept of community resilience as a tool for disaster risk management has attracted substantial attention from all parties, such as governments, designers, decision-makers, and stakeholders. Community resilience can be assessed more effectively by using a multi-disciplinary approach that takes into account the communityâ€™s uncertainties, as opposed to a single-criteria approach. The global community resilience model must be long-term validated and dependent on the most vulnerable and low-resilience portions of the community, according to a prior study. According to the review of the seismic resiliency studies performed in the recent decades, the frameworks for the quantification assessment of the community resilience are explained. Moreover, several case studies for community resilience and the application of different subsystems are reviewed and elaborated in this paper. Based on these resilience studies, the main challenges on the effectiveness of the resilience assessment are the availability and accessibility of the data, the financial resources, and the cooperation from all the parties.
