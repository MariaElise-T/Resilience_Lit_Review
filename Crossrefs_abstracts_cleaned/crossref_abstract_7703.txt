This study prioritises the lean, agile, resilient and green (LARG) supplychain practices in Pakistan’s FMCG sector. This study utilises theAHP methodology to rank the different LARG practices in Pakistan’sFMCG sector. The primary purpose of this analytical study is torecognise and prioritise the usage of these practices to develop theLARG paradigm in the FMCG sector. In this study, various methodshave been identified with the help of extensive literature review and discussion with subject matter experts. The results demonstrate that anorganisational structure (infrastructure) that can deal with disruption isone of the most critical practices among all LARG practices. The result also indicates that firms should establish resilience in their supply chainnetwork, and described as the most vital supply chain phenomenonamong the LARG category. The study findings provide the directionto the supply chain professional as to which practices are critical forestablishing the LARG system in the organisation.
