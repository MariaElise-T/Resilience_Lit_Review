Candidates for the public teaching profession are subjected to high levels of stress, which can lead to the development of burnout syndrome during the competitive examination process. The present research reflects the objective of analysing the effect of resilience on burnout syndrome, stress and study hours in Spanish public teacher candidates. A cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative and ex post facto study was carried out on a sample of 4117 Spanish candidates (M = 31.03; S.D = 6.800). The Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure the stress variable. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to collect data related to burnout syndrome and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to measure data related to resilience. The conclusions are that resilience helps to mitigate the effects generated by burnout syndrome and stress, helping to maintain a positive attitude towards the number of hours of study.
