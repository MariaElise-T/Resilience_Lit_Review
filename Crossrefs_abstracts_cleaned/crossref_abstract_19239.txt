Abstract
This research is motivated by a change in learning methods that were initially face-to-face to online learning that resulted from the COVOD-19 outbreak.

The method used in this research is descriptive method with 36 elementary school students as subjects in one of the primary schools in Majalengka district, West Java, Indonesia. The results of this study, mathematics resilience of elementary school students is in the medium category. The findings related to mathematics resilience of elementary school students namely resilience is not only influenced by the complexity of the material and changes in learning methods. However other factors such as the packaging of learning by the teacher, the media used by the teacher, and the communication used by the teacher also affect the mathematics resilience of elementary school students.
