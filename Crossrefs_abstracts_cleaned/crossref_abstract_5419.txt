AbstractFarmers, ranchers, and foresters are facing increasing challenges related to changing climate and weather, manifested in rising average temperatures, more frequent extreme rainfall events, extended drought, and heat waves. These changes are also impacting pest abundance and distribution, creating new pest problems and straining current pest management options and decision‐making. Key factors for U.S. agriculture and producer resilience in tackling new environmental and pest challenges lie in the ability of producers to apply effective, economical integrated pest management (IPM) approaches and in support for research and development of new and renewed IPM tactics and systems to meet 21st century needs.
