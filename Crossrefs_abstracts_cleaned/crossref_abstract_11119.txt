Abstract
With global rise in frequency and intensity of natural disaster events, the adverse effects of climate change are becoming increasingly evident. A recent example is the extreme heatwave experienced by western North America which has caused a substantial loss of life and damage to the infrastructure. Research suggests that the intensity of heatwaves is amplified in urban areas due to the contribution of Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) which is largely a function of surrounding urban landscape. In order to develop urban resilience to the extreme heat, it is important to understand the direct relationship between urban form and the temperature elevations caused by the heatwaves. This research examines the disproportionate effects of heatwaves in urban areas and their dependence on urban form by leveraging the microclimatic weather data collected during the 2021 heatwave event in western North America. Strong positive correlations were found between heatwave intensity and both impervious area (PRCC=0.79) and population density (PRCC = 0.83), whereas tree canopy cover was negatively correlated with heatwave intensity (PRCC = -0.89). This analysis can be used to inform urban planning, and to establish proper resilience measures against future heatwave events.
