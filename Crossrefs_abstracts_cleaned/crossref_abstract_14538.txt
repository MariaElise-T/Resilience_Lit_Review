Abstract Separate in‐depth interviews were conducted with two groups of highly stressed 4th–6th grade urban children classified; is stress‐affected (SA) and stress‐resilient (SR), and their parents. Judges identified interview items reflecting three components of a good parent‐child relationship, i.e. positive parental attitudes, involvement and guidance SB parents and children scored higher than their SA counterparts on all three relational dimensions. Additionally, SR parent‐child dyads had more congruent views of their relationship than SA dyads. These findings suggest that positive parent‐child relationship qualities play an important protective role that favors resilient outcomes, at ages 10–12, among children who have experienced major life stress.
