Geoscience information supports strategic development planning for building disaster resilience in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is a city challenged by issues such as landslides, floods and unfavourable ground conditions. Aspects such as the subsurface setting and susceptibility to hazards offer insights to resolve risks that are expected to worsen with climate change. Geoscience data were collated from field investigation and other sources for spatial integration using geographic information system software. The information on engineering ground conditions and susceptibility to geohazards was then combined to demarcate zones that are suitable for urban development. This approach can be applied to other cities so that relevant geoscience information is integrated for planning and decision making in a changing climate. The findings reveal that 20% of the city has high suitability for development and is generally not prone to climate hazards. About 80% of the land area in Kuala Lumpur has medium to high ground constraint, and this includes around 25% of the city area that is susceptible to landslides and floods. In the worst-case scenario where no action is taken, communities and urban assets within these susceptible areas would be exposed and vulnerable to more landslides and floods due to climate change. Additional development should be limited in such areas, and where already developed, targeted hazard-specific measures can be taken to build resilience.
