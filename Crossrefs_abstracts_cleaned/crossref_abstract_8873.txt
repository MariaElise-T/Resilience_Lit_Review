During the period of social governance transformation, China and even the world have entered a high-risk stage. In such a risk community, the community, as the basic unit of social organism, is a key link and important support for stabilizing social order and improving social governance in the face of sudden major risk events. From the perspective of community resilience, it not only undertakes the interdisciplinary mission of Community Governance, but also broadens the resilient governance pattern of combining hardness and flexibility in the community. However, the current community risk prevention and control in China also exposes the shortcomings and problems in the resilience governance of grassroots communities in terms of process resilience, structural resilience, psychological resilience, and technological resilience. In view of this, in the new risk society of the post pandemic era, it is necessary to enhance the diversification of community resilience governance entities, strengthen emergency management mechanisms, cultivate citizens' awareness and ability to respond to risks, accelerate the construction of smart communities, and gradually achieve normal and good governance of communities in high-risk societies.
