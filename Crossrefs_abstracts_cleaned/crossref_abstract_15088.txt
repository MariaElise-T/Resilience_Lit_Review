Taking a city as an example, a city physical examination index system is built around 8 aspects, including ecological livability, health and comfort, safety and resilience, and convenient transportation. Using the normalization method and hierarchical analysis method, we calculate and evaluate the natural background and operation of the city. The overall urban living environment is good, the ecological livability and neatness and orderliness of the city are high, the construction of convenient transportation and safety resilience needs to be strengthened, and there is still room for improvement in terms of style characteristics, health and comfort, innovation and vitality, diversity and tolerance, etc. The population density, the number of good air quality days, and the mortality rate of 10,000 vehicles in the urban center of the city are the highest. According to the results of the multisource urban health check, the city needs to take the problems and needs as the guide to accurately manage the “urban diseases” in the future and strive to improve the satisfaction, happiness, and sense of belonging of urban residents.
