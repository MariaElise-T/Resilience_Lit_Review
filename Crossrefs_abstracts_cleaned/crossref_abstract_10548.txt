Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has significant impact on the fisheries sector, especially the distribution process of fish, including the potential paralysis of economic life in the form of declining revenues due to the dissolution of the marketing chain of fish from the fishermen to consumers. This study aims to analyze the economic resilience of fishermen communities; and identifying their adaptation patterns. The method used in this research was qualitative descriptive analysis. The result divided into two acts, the act of fishing-related operations and actions outside the fishing activities. In the fishing activity, most actions performed by the fishermen were fishing frequency (33.6%), adjustment of fishing cost (28.9%) and the adjustment of the number of crew (37.5%). For actions outside of fishing activities, most fishermen during this pandemic often borrowed money from customers (48.7%) and from relatives (46.9%). In addition, some fishermen also pawned their assets (2.5%) and some even sold their assets (1.8%). Fishermen resilience actions in the Karangantu ANP are classified as low, namely 69.6%. The factors that influence the number of resilience measures are the government assistance dummy, ship/vessel ownership dummy, and there is a patron-client relationship.
