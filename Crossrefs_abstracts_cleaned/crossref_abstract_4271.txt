An element that can influence the actual value of risk is social resilience, however, the value of
the impact of the main components of social resilience on risk is not known. The motivation for
addressing the topic was the desire to develop a tool to measure social resilience in the community.
The aim of the study was to determine the outflow of social resilience to community risk.
Through an analysis of the literature, the main components of social resilience were classified,
and then, using cause-and-effect relationships, individual activities affecting social resilience were
extracted.
The author of the paper anticipated that this concept could serve as a starting point for a more
complex form of calculation and criteria. It should be noted that social resilience is a factor that
affects both the probability of events and the consequences.
The authorâ€™s concept of community risk assessment taking into account social resilience is an
open concept for editing. This concept requires classifying elements that build social resilience and
providing them with standards, in which they should occur.
