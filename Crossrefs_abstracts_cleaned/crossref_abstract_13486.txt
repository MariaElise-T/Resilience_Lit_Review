Purpose– The present study examines ways in which micro and small business owners and managers in the olive oil industry seek to adapt to emerging challenges and build resilience. In an increasingly demanding business environment, the ability to become resilient and be able to adapt to new or existing challenges is crucial. However, in what ways do micro and small business owners and managers seek to adapt to emerging challenges and build resilience? The present study examines these issues among micro and small wine and olive oil producers.Design/methodology/approach– An online questionnaire was designed to gather the views of respondents on challenges, impacts of these challenges and strategies they consider to adapt to current challenges. A total of 93 winery owners/managers and 52 olive growers participated.Findings– The findings identify increasing costs, decreasing consumption and the effects of the economic crisis as the most significant barriers, with impacts in the form of loss of trust in government institutions and loss of confidence in a soon economic recovery. To adapt and become resilient, enhancing promotional, educational and diversification activities, such as starting or growing exports, or becoming more involved in technology and social media are perceived as fundamental business strategies.Originality/value– In considering elements related to the theory of resilience, the study provides empirical evidence of adaptive strategies among micro and small businesses, as well as ways to achieve resilience. Overall, the findings have important socio-economic implications for various stakeholders, including the sectors involved, government agencies, and ultimately for consumers, and local communities where businesses operate.
