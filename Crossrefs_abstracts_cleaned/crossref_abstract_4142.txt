 This theoretical article suggests that advocacy by children promotes their resilience and positive selfconception. The psychological benefits of such advocacy by the child are distinguished from mental health interventions where the child is generally viewed as a passive participant and 'deficient' in critical ways. Evidence is presented concerning children who have faced great adversity to illustrate the link between advocacy by children and resilience. Children's right to contribute to the preservation of their human dignity and welfare through their own advocacy is highlighted. The role of professionals in supporting children's advocacy efforts is also addressed.
