Agriculture is highly exposed to climate warming, and promoting traditional cultivars constitutes an adaptive farming mechanism from climate change impacts. This study compared seed traits and adaptability in the germinative process, through temperature and drought response, between a commercial cultivar and Mediterranean Phaseolus lunatus L. landraces. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to characterize local cultivars. Optimal germination temperature, and water stress tolerance, with increasing polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentrations, were initially evaluated. Base temperature, thermal time, base potential and hydrotime were calculated to compare the thermal and hydric responses and competitiveness among cultivars. Eight molecular markers were analyzed to calculate polymorphism and divergence parameters, of which three, together with South American species accessions, were used to construct a Bayesian phylogeny. No major differences were found in seed traits, rather different bicolored patterns. A preference for high temperatures and fast germination were observed. The ‘Pintat’ landrace showed marked competitiveness compared to the commercial cultivar when faced with temperature and drought tolerance. No genetic differences were found among the Valencian landraces and the phylogeny confirmed their Andean origin. Promoting landraces for their greater resilience is a tool to help overcome the worldwide challenge deriving from climate change and loss of agrobiodiversity.
