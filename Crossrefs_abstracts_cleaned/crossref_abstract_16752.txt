Abstract
Urban resilience can reflect the city’s ability to cope with crisis and risks, and it is an important guarantee for urban sustainable development. In the process of urban development, attention should be paid to coordinating with urban resilience construction. Taking 21 cities and prefectures of Sichuan Province as the research objects, this paper constructs the evaluation system of urban resilience from the aspects of economy, infrastructure, ecology and society, and the evaluation system of urbanization level from the aspects of population, land and economy. By using Entropy Method, the Coupling Coordination Degree model, coupling coordination between urban resilience and urbanization level is discussed. According to the results, the urban resilience level of cities and prefectures in Sichuan Province presents a pattern of “one city is quite high and the rest are low”, and the urbanization level presents a pattern of “one city is quite high, a few are high and the rest are low”. The coupling coordination degree of most of the cities and prefectures in Sichuan Province are low, and the cities with high coupling coordination are concentrated in Sichuan Basin. Combining with the urbanization level and coupling coordination degree, the cities and prefectures are divided into four types, high-high, high-low, low-high and low-low, in this paper. Corresponding development ideas are put forward so as to provide ideas and suggestions for the coordinated development of various cities and prefectures in Sichuan Province.
