Background: In different crises without any exception, especially sudden emergencies, the role of human effective components (HECs), native human effective components (NHECs) (belonging to a specific space and location), and especially core native human effective components (CNHECs); and among CNHECs, level of management skills, ignorance, and managerâ€™s mind bandwidth are of vital importance in crisis management. These three specified CNHECs can affect crisis management and managers as well as the level of latency in planning, strategy, and management, and as such through a complexity of reactions (i.e. A. affective, B. behavioral, and C. cognitive reactions) to increase resiliency and decrease distress in metropolitan urban areas. The time limitation is also an important issue to be considered.  Materials and Methods: The type of review method has been integrative review. For a better review process, 200 articles during an approximately 50-year time (1972-2021) period during 3 years of the review process were studied and for the selection method, the well-known scientific databases and universities, the search terms, and inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected, analyzed, and summarized through a review protocol. Results: We aim to shed light on HECs preparation of NHECs and CNHECs in disaster management which will generate a good understanding to increase the resiliency and decrease the distress in crisis managers in times of sudden emergencies in metropoles as a sustainable development framework for the future.  Conclusion: By creating the proposed taxonomy and classification of CNHECs in crisis management (managers), at first a better understanding will be obtained which in times of sudden crisis can increase resiliency and decrease distress generating a sustainable development framework.
