As the basic unit of residents’ activities and social management, communities are the disaster bearers of various public security emergencies. To improve the ability and level of community governance, as well as to strengthen the construction of resilient communities, a tripartite evolutionary game model of local government, developers, and home buyers is built, and numerical simulation is carried out using Matlab to analyze the impact mechanism of main parameters on the evolutionary stability strategy. The results show that: (1) The three parties’ different initial intentions will lead to different evolutionary stability strategies of the system, and the system’s final evolution result will reach the ideal state only when the initial willingness of developers and buyers is high. (2) The greater the government’s subsidy coefficient and the greater the regulatory intensity, the more likely it is that developers will choose to build resilient communities. (3) Public awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation is an important determinant of the purchase of resilient community housing strategies. To achieve rapid development of resilient communities, the intensity of regulation must be continuously improved, the public’s awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation must be strengthened, and the government’s regulatory costs must be reduced.
