 The world is increasingly dependent on critical infrastructures such as the electric power grid, water, gas and oil transport systems. Due to this increasing dependence and inadequate infrastructure expansion, these systems are becoming increasingly stressed. These additional stresses leave these systems less resilient to external faults, both accidental and malicious than ever before. As a result of this increased vulnerability, many critical infrastructures are becoming susceptible to cascading failures, where an initial fault caused by an external force may induce a domino-effect of further component failures. An important implication is that traditional infrastructure risk analysis methods, often relying on Monte Carlo sampling of fault scenarios, are no longer sufficient. Instead, systematic analysis based on worst-case attacks by intelligent adversaries is essential. This paper describes a coevolutionary methodology to simultaneously discover low-effort high-impact faults and corresponding means of hardening infrastructures against them. We empirically validate our methodology through an electric power transmission system case study.
