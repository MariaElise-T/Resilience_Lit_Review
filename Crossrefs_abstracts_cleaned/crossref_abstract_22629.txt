This study aims to investigate the characteristics of space through the architecture of Lacaton & Vassal and to analyze elements that enhance spatial resilience. By examining the architectural philosophy of Lacaton & Vassal, the study focuses on three remodeling projects in France to explore strategies and elements that strengthen spatial resilience. To achieve the research objectives, a reclassification of space resilience characteristics was conducted based on a review of previous studies on resilience, and criteria for analysis were established. This involved an in-depth analysis of the selected cases, comparing spaces before and after remodeling, and investigating five elements of spatial resilience in the remodeled spacesThis case analysis is expected to yield significant data, providing a theoretical foundation for remodeling methods to enhance spatial resilience in aging spaces in the future.
