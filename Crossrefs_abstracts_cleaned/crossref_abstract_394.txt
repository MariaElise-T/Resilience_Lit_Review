 This paper describes the experiences of one child welfare unit that participated in Canada's first national pilot of the Looking After Children Assessment and Action Records (Kufeldt, Simard, Vachon, Baker, & Andrews, 2000). A review three years after the end of the project found that the method was well-entrenched in practice. Its use promoted resilience and improved outcomes for the young people in foster care. It also enhanced social workersâ€™ commitment to their work and to their own resilience, despite the sometimes overwhelming demands of protection work.
