In the context of a global public health crisis, but also of an unprecedented economic, social and humanitarian crisis that created systemic tensions not only in terms of global governance, but also in the business environment, the paper analyses from a theoretical point of view how an organization can be successful in the long term in its field of activity by conducting a literature review involving recent behavioural studies. Success is analysed from the perspective of the people who make up the organization, people suitable for the activity they carry out, willing to adapt to the organizational environment and work synergistically, who contribute to increasing the resilience of the organization in which they operate.
A first objective of the research consists in investigating the valences of the term resilience. In this sense, the authors seek to identify whether resilience is a property, or a sum of characteristics, whether it can be influenced or not. The second objective is to identify a model of good practices that the resilient manager can implement in the company, regardless of the offer that the internal and external environment presents to the company over time. This article will briefly highlight the results of the theoretical analysis of the concept of resilience (at the relational level, the resilience of the employee and the manager) in the long-term operation of a company in the business environment.
