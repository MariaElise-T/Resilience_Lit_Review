Abstract
Farmers’ households in upstream watersheds in Indonesia experience crop failure in their business cultivation as a result of climate change. The aim of this study, knowing the level of farmer resilience in various agroforestry systems of mixed gardens – talun developed in various agroforestry systems of mixed gardens – talun developed on the highlands in the upstream Minraleng sub-watershed. Data collection was carried out through observation and interviews with farmer household respondents. The results showed that farmer households developed an intercropping agroforestry system of teak and corn in the first phase (1-4 years) and mixed plantations of bananas, cacao and papaya in the second phase (4-15 years), and continued with mixed plantations dominated by teak, have a higher adaptive capacity and levels of resilience to climate change. This is because it has more diversity of plants and a variety of livelihoods, and has the power of mutual association between plants in dealing with drought.
