AbstractThis study investigated the relationship between perfectionism and relative deprivation among nursing students in China as well as the mediating role of interpersonal sensitivity and the moderating role of resilience in this relationship. A cross‚Äêsectional study design involved 682 nursing students participants from two universities in Henan Province, China, using questionnaires about demographics, perfectionism, relative deprivation, interpersonal sensitivity, and resilience. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis and the PROCESS macro in regression analysis were used for data analysis. Adaptive perfectionism was not significantly correlated with relative deprivation, while maladaptive perfectionism was significantly positively correlated with interpersonal sensitivity, relative deprivation, and resilience. Interpersonal sensitivity mediated the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and relative deprivation, accounting for 41.07% of the total effect. Moreover, the first half path and direct path of this process were moderated by resilience. These results show that targeted interventions to reduce maladaptive perfectionism, reduce interpersonal sensitivity and improve resilience of nursing students could help reduce their relative deprivation.
