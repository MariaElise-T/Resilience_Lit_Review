Research shows that resilience exerts a significant impact on organizational citizenship behavior. This linkage may be partly due to prevailing organizational circumstances. This study assessed the moderating effect of leadership and interpersonal trusts in the correlation between resilience and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Responses were obtained from 236 healthcare employees in Ghana's public and private hospitals. This study used regression to analyze the predictions. Findings of the study indicated that resilience, interpersonal (employee), and leadership trust positively and significantly predicted OCB. The hierarchical regression indicated that leadership trust moderated the linkage between resilience and organizational citizenship behavior. However, interpersonal trust moderates the linkage between resilience and organizational citizenship behavior. Unequivocally, resilience produces the highest organizational citizenship behavior when leaders trust their subordinates. This study, therefore, pinpoints the significant role of leadership trust in alleviating the impact of resilience on organizational citizenship behavior.
