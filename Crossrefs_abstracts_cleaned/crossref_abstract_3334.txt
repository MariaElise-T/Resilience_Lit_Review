Universities play a critical role in educating students for their successful
career. However, in higher educational institutes major focus is given on
their academic achievement and psychological factors like academic
stress are ignored. The aim of this quantitative study was to investigate
predictive relationship between academic resilience and stress of the
university students. Convenience sampling technique was used to collect
data from 738 northern area university students in Pakistan. Brief
Resilience Scale (BRS) having 6 items developed by Smith et al., (2008)
was used to measure perceived resilience of university students, freely
available on internet for academic research. During data collection
respondents were asked to assess themselves on a 6-point Likert scale on
both scales. Tools were validated by experts and reliability was
established using Cronbachâ€™s alpha (0.813). For data analysis, the
gathered information was organized and summarized in Excel.
Following that, it was analysed using SPSS version 22. To find the effect
of perceived resilience stress of the university students regression model
was used. Before analysis assumptions of regression model as given by
Field (2013) and Laerd (2018) were considered. Findings of this research
revealed that perceived resilience scores had a great significant negative
effect on stress of university students. The present study highlighted the
influence of psychological constructs resilience on reducing stress of
university students which ultimately affect their academic performance.
In the light of results of current study, it can be recommended that
through workshops, seminars, and orientation sessions how university
teachers can be motivated to enhance their capacity for teaching and
learning using resilience abilities.
