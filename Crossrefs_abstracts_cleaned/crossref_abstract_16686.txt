In the era of turbulent environment, handling disruptions and building resilience is of prime importance to businesses. Most literature on building resilience in a supply chain is organization-focused and discusses firm-level abilities to bounce back after a disruption. In this study, the authors explored and defined collaborative resilience in a supply chain. Specifically, a case study approach across five supply chains was followed. Through this research, an empirical definition and understanding of collaborative resilience in supply chains was derived as the finding of the study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical research to develop a definition of collaborative resilience in supply chain. This study may strike many future research studies for research on the phenomenon of collaborative resilience in supply chains.
