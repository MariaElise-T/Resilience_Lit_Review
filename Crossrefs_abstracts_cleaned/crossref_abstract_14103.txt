Bridges are fundamental links for the movement of goods and people and bridge damage can thus have significant impacts on society and the economy. Earthquakes can be extremely destructive and can compromise bridge functionality, which is essential for communities. Evaluation of bridge functionality is thus fundamental in the planning of emergency responses and socioeconomic recovery procedures. It is especially useful to define parameters to assess investments in bridge infrastructure. Resilience is a key parameter that can identify decision making procedures necessary for recovery investments. In this regard, resilience can be defined as the rapidity of a system to return to pre-disaster levels of functionality. This aim of this work was to assess the lack of robust analytical procedures for quantifying systematic restoration for earthquake-damaged bridges, to provide a link between the assessment of resilience and its application in decision making approaches. The proposed methodology (called seismic resilience for recovery investments of bridges) uses functionalityâ€“time curves that allow quantification of resilience along with readable findings for a wider range of stakeholders. The results presented in this paper should be of interest to multi-sectorial actors (i.e. bridge owners, transportation authorities and public administrators) and could drive interdisciplinary applications such as the assessment of recovery techniques and solutions.
