Objectives This study was conducted to examine the relationship between firefighters, focusing on social imposition perfectionism, social anxiety, and self-encouragement among the variables affecting the resilience of firefighters. Furthermore, it was intended to examine the mediating effect of social anxiety in the relationship between social imposition perfectionism and resilience, and to see if self-encouragement controls the mediating effect in this process.
Methods To verify this, a total of 117 questions were produced using four measurement tools suitable for research problems and standardized, and a survey was conducted on 330 firefighters working at the fire station and 119 safety center in S area. In the process of collecting the questionnaire directly by the researcher, 300 copies were collected, and a total of 271 data were used for analysis, except for 29 copies of unfaithful responses.
Results First, social imposition perfectionism had a significant effect on resilience, and social anxiety was found to partially mediate the effect of social imposition perfectionism on resilience. Second, as a result of checking whether self-encouragement plays a role as a moderating variable in the relationship between social imposition perfectionism and social anxiety, it was found that self-encouragement controls the relationship between social imposition perfectionism and social anxiety. Third, it was found that self-encouragement controls the indirect effect through social anxiety in the effect of social imposition perfectionism on resilience.
Conclusions Based on the results of the study, the significance and implications of the study were examined, various intervention methods were proposed to increase the resilience of firefighters, and finally, the limitations of the study and suggestions for follow-up research were examined.
