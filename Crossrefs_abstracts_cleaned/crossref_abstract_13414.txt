Purpose The present research work has tried to investigate the impact of workplace bullying (WB) on turnover intention (TI); the study has also analyzed the effect of psychological health (PH) and resilience (RS) indirectly as mediators in between WB and TI. Further, the role of perceived HRM as a moderator directly and through RS has been tested. The study has been carried in the context of Indian IT sector.Design/methodology/approach The analysis of the moderated mediation model was done through PLS-SEM, owing to the medium size of the sample. SmartPLS 3 was used to check on the psychometric principles if any for the measurement model and also adopt a two-step analysis for the proposed model.Findings The findings of the present study have validated the empirical model, showing a significant relationship in between the proposed constructs. WB had a positive impact on TI whereas PH and RS turned out to be partial mediators but there was no evidence as to which mediator had a larger impact. Further, perceived HRM served as a moderator in between WB and TI and also through RS.Originality/value The study is first of its kind which has tried to investigate an exhaustive mediated moderation model in the Indian IT sector. The study has postulated that it is not just the HRM content but the perceptions of employees toward HRM which can be beneficial in resolving sensitive issues such as WB and eventually turnover intents.
