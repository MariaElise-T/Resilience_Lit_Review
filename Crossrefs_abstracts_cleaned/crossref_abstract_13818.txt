One of the major challenges faced by the local level agencies is the identification and applicability of assessment metrics and standards for urban water resilience, especially in India, as most of the considerable research on the resilience assessment refers to the developed western world context. These metrics have limited applicability in Indian context owing to limited data availability and varied significance of various indicators. It is of vital importance to assess the inherent urban water resilience, so as to channelize the limited resources in prioritized sectors, based on the assessment of water services for cities. This paper attempts to develop an urban water resilience assessment matrix, typically highlighting the integration of technology based on the applicability in Indian context. This matrix is based on a mix of household level indicators as well as utility level indicators. This novel matrix, for the cities of developing countries, attempt to capture the heterogeneity prevailing in the urban water sector based on the supply modes for city households.
