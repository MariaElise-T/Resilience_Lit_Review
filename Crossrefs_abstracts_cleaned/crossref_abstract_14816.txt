AbstractResilient denture liners (RDLs) change their hardness in a short time. Hence, their usefulness is limited to the short term only. Therefore, this laboratory study investigated the influence of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets incorporation on the longevity of a commercially available RDL material. An auto‐polymerizing acrylic‐based RDL was selected for this purpose. The control group (G0) was prepared as such according to the manufacturer's instructions. However, for the G1 group, 0.1 wt/wt% of GO nanosheet was incorporated in powder of RDL. Similarly, G2 group and G3 group were the composites of 0.3 and 0.6 wt/wt% of the GO‐resin matrix. A total of 60 disk‐shaped samples were prepared, having three subgroups with 15 disks each (n = 15). Surface roughness, water contact angle, Shore A hardness, water sorption, and solubility parameters were evaluated using a two‐way analysis of variance (p < .05). GO nanosheets facilitated in reducing the hardness of RDL without affecting the surface roughness and wettability properties. Additionally, statistically reduced water solubility and sorption values were observed in G3 group, that is, 0.69 ± 0.25% and 0.93 ± 0.18%, respectively, compared to 1.17 ± 0.13% and 1.41 ± 0.18%, respectively, of the control group at the end of 14‐day water immersion. The incorporation of GO nanosheets seems a viable option for the enhanced physical properties and clinical life of RDLs.
