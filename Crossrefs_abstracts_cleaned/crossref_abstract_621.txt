The Resilience Doughnut is an ecological and Solution Focused model showing the interaction of resources that build resilience during a person’s lifetime. In order to statistically validate the model, a 44-item scale (RDA) was developed and tested with 859 adults. Reliability was explored showing a very good fit α = 0.92 and a good representation of the research constructs. All seven resource strengths of the RDA showed negative correlation with each of the subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS). While those in the moderate to severe depression symptoms range reported less than three resource strengths, those with mild to no depressive symptoms reported over three resource strengths scoring above the mean. The findings support strength-based interventions which focus on developing contextual and relational strengths as a way of impacting mental health outcomes.
