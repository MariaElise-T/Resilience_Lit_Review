The Okavango and Limpopo river basins are challenged by the effects of climate change, where communities that are traditionally dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods must adapt to conditions less predictable. Divergent interests among various stakeholders contribute to tensions between livelihoods and conservation, and understanding the perspectives of communities is critical for planning. However, traditional methodological tools are not adequate to reflect the diverse perspectives of respondents at scale. A baseline study of community resilience approaches to adapt to climate change across both river basin areas used a participant-coded micro-narrative approach to establish how people understand resilience across diverse areas. This methodological approach holds potential as a framework for understanding community experiences, but even methodologies designed for participation have limits in both processes and results. This article explores both and presents potential uses for participant-coded narratives in future evaluation processes.
