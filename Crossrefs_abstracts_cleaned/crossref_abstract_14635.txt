This paper provides a literature review and survey of maturity and process capability models, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) tools and frameworks to identify strategies for assessing and measuring resilience and risk management capabilities, with a specific focus on the electricity generating sector. The focus is on the use of models such as CERT-RMM, and others, as a means of addressing challenges associated with cyber security and risk management. Foundational concepts, terminology and definitions are provided; examples of maturity and process capability models are presented and discussed, tools that enable process capability and resilience are identified, including those specific to the electricity generating sector. The evolution of models and how they have addressed challenges is presented, in addition to the characteristics and differences of models and the growth in domains where they can be used. The benefits of the application of process capability and maturity models in maintaining and enhancing resilience and cyber security protection is supported in this paper and recommendations for research opportunities that may yield further insight and measurement capabilities are offered.
