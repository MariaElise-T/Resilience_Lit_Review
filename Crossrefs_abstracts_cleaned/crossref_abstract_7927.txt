AbstractThis study aims to investigate the significance of organizational ambidexterity (OA) in creating supply chain resilience (SCRES) during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodological triangulation is applied in this study. A literature review, semi-structured online interviews and insights from open webinars serve as the sources of data. A framework, based on three pillars: validation, positioning and evaluation of business practices, is used for data analysis. The dependencies between OA activities and SCRES strategies are presented. The authors discuss their evolution during and in the post-pandemic period and outline the SCM trends in a strategic perspective. This paper investigates a pathway for closing the gap between OA theory and industry practice to create SCRES during and post-COVID-19 outbreak. This article starts the discussion on creating SCRES through OA. Future quantitative and qualitative research should explore the applicability of OA to enhance SCRES in a dynamic environment. Understanding the critical connection between exploitation and exploration practices and how OA influences SCRES provides valuable insight into the subject to supply chain managers supporting them in pursuing their roles successfully in the times of crisis. This study is focused on two concepts, OA and SCRES, of critical importance for how practitioners manage supply chains in the times of crisis. The resilience of supply chains to crises is crucial for the well-being of societies.
