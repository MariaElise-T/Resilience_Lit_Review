Previous studies have acknowledged the importance of resilience in enabling individuals to cope and bounce back from crises and unexpected situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study advances conservation of resources theory by investigating the job, social, and personal resources underlying employees’ resilience, and the impact of resilience in stimulating job engagement amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The model was tested using data collected from 259 employees in Malaysia. Results of path modeling analysis revealed significant impacts of self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and family and friends’ support on employees’ resilience. Besides, resilience was significantly associated with job engagement. Our findings suggest that management concerns for employees may not enhance employees’ resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, management could stimulate their employees’ resilience by providing them with the flexibility to spend quality time with their loved ones and adequate support for enabling working conditions.
