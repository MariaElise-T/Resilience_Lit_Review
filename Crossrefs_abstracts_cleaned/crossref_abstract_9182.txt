AbstractHuman mobility connects urban dwellers and neighborhoods and impacts social equity. An in-depth understanding of human mobility helps to enhance urban resilience. However, limited research has focused on mobility resilience. Building on previous research, this study looks at the neighborhood connectivity enabled by urban mobility. We analyze the aggregated mobility patterns in Boston through the coupling of network structure and social characteristics. Geocoded twitter data combined with socioeconomic datasets were used to create a mobility-based urban network. Through the quantitative analysis, we found that the social segregation in Boston shapes its mobility network. Network communities identified by the Louvain modularity algorithm are often self-containing, meaning that their residents are more likely to move within their communities. A multinomial regression reveals that spatial racial and income segregation has a strong impact on the dynamic segregation of the network. The beneficial network characteristics –e.g. higher density and well-connected motifs– are less present in areas with bolder presence of minorities. Thus, the resilience state is not equitable among neighborhoods of different income levels and races, indicating that the resilience measures of urban networks need to be adapted according to sociodemographic characteristics.
