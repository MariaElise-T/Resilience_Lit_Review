In the context of the development of industry 4.0 embedded in various industries, organizations face stiffening competition from external dynamically changing and unpredictable environments. To remain competitive and sustainable in this era, organizations need resilience and innovation capability. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the association between external integration, resilience, innovation capability, and logistics service providers (LSPs) operational performance. Moreover, this research investigates the mediating effects of sustainable logistics and innovation capability between external integration and LSPs operational performance. Based on Resource orchestration theory, a framework has been drawn. The survey of 273 Chinese LSPs was examined through the PLS-SEM technique. The findings indicate that external integration has a positive relationship with logistics resilience and innovation capability, which have a positive impact on LSPsâ€™ operational performance. The results also show that innovation capability positively mediates the relationship between external integration and operational performance. Unexpectedly, logistics resilience has not played a mediating role between external integration and operational performance. This study makes contributions to the construction of a mechanism of LSP performance improvement by integrating the external environment, resilience, and innovation. The paper also advanced the theory of resource orchestration theory by adding these two mediators of logistics resilience and innovation capability
