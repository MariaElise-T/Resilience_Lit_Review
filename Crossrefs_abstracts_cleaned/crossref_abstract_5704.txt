This study explores the impact of 3-weeks intervention based on resilience as a psychosocial skill to enhance the levels of optimism, self-esteem, and resilience as well as the correlation between these variables. Participants were selected randomly from the Law College studying in Undergraduate Program. The intact group received 3 two-hours weekly sessions. Measures of Life Orientation Test (Revised), resilience scale and self-esteem scale were administered to gauge pre-post intervention. Data analysis indicated a significantly higher resilience score, moderately high score on the self-esteem score and significant high-rise on levels of optimism providing a reasonable positive impact. The findings of the study clearly show that resilience intervention is effective to boost self-esteem, resilience and positive life orientation.
