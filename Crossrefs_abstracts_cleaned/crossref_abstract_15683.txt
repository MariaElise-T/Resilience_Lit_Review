Resilience is understood as interactive processes that strengthen the individual and the family in the face of the demands of adversity or vulnerable situation. Resilience is fostered from a psychopedagogical approach when practices are developed that assist in facing challenges positively, having life projects and developing academic potentialities. Thus, the objective of this systematic review of the literature is cartography programs that promote resilience in children, adolescents, or youths who are facing a challenging condition, such as a disease or disability. The PRISMA declaration was used to guide this systematic search. The databases consulted were Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCOhost, ERIC and Dialnet Plus. Open access articles were selected between 2016 and 2021. The selection resulted in 15 educational programs. The results indicate that there are several models for building resilience, such as ecosystem, family, community, and academic models. In conclusion, interdisciplinarity is a cross-cutting axis for enhancing resilience in vulnerable settings.
