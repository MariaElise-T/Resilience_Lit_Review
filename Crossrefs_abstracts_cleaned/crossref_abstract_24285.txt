Territorial space ecological restoration is a significant way to map the development of “ecological priority, green, and low-carbon” and realize the goal of reducing carbon emissions. Based on the evaluation of the degree of urban ecological resilience restriction, this study aimed to diagnose the key areas of surface–line–point ecological restoration under the guidance of the resilience target by constructing a patch–corridor–matrix ecological network; then, the corresponding repair strategy was proposed. The results showed that (1) there was an obvious core–periphery structure in the resilience restriction intensity of the Chengdu–Chongqing region, showing a gradual decreasing trend from Chengdu and Chongqing to the surrounding cities; (2) the regional ecological network, including 17 ecological source patches and 33 potential ecological corridors, was identified; and (3) the diagnosed key areas of ecological restoration were composed of surface–line–point multiscale spatial morphology, including 7793.81 km2 of key areas of ecological source restoration, 380.39 km of key areas of ecological corridor restoration, and 29 key areas of ecological pinch point restoration. The construction of ecological restoration strategies with carbon neutralization as the core idea at different scales was realized. The research can provide a reference for scientifically identifying key areas of ecological restoration in territorial space, coordinating and planning major projects of ecological restoration, and optimizing the allocation of natural resources.
