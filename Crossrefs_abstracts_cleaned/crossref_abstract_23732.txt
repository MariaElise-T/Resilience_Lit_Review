Under water acoustic sensor network is the unique case of wireless sensor network in which the physical characteristics limits the capability of sensor network due to various problems like Doppler-spreads, medium significnt delay, Double-side spreading, limited bandwidth and frequency-selective fading. Ensuring QOS is very challenging problem in acoustic sensor networks. In this work, a QOS centric hybrid routing protocol with consideration of fault resilience is proposed. The solution use the parameters of the network at all Application Layer, Network Layer, MAC Layer, and PHY Layer, which are the different layers of IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack, thus calculating Node selection score which helps in identifying the best forwarding node for a constrained reliable data transmission. The solution involves dynamic link quality estimation, congestion awareness, packet injection ratio estimation and physical switching that cumulatively ensures fault-resilient and QoS delivery over acoustic sensor network.
