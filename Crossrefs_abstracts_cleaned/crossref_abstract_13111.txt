Structural resilience describes urban drainage systemsâ€™ (UDSs) ability to minimize the frequency and magnitude of failure due to common structural issues such as pipe clogging and cracking or pump failure. Structural resilience is often neglected in the design of UDSs. The current literature supports structural decentralization as a way to introduce structural resilience into UDSs. Although there are promising methods in the literature for generating and optimizing decentralized separate stormwater collection systems, incorporating hydraulic simulations in unsteady flow, these approaches sometimes require high computational effort, especially for flat areas. This may hamper their integration into ordinary commercially designed UDS software due to their predominantly scientific purposes. As a response, this paper introduces simplified cost and structural resilience indices that can be used as heuristic parameters for optimizing the UDS layout. These indices only use graph connectivity information, which is computationally much less expensive than hydraulic simulation. The use of simplified objective functions significantly simplifies the feasible search space and reduces blind searches by optimization. To demonstrate the application and advantages of the proposed model, a real case study in the southwest city of Ahvaz, Iran was explored. The proposed framework was proven to be promising for reducing the computational effort and for delivering realistic cost-wise and resilient UDSs.
