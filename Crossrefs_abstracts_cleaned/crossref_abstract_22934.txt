This study aims to examine the academic stress coping strategies profiles of Mongolian students in Korea and to explore the differences in academic resilience, academic engagement, and academic achievement according to academic stress coping strategies profiles. The study respondents were 211 students from the 5th grade of elementary school to the 3rd grade of high school at a Mongolian school in Korea. As a result of the study, five types of latent profiles were found to be suitable for the data. 'The lowest adaptive coping strategies+the and lowest maladaptive coping strategies group' (Group 1), 'The high adaptive coping strategies+low maladaptive coping strategies group' (Group 2), 'the low adaptive coping strategies+moderate maladaptive coping strategies group' (Group 3), 'adaptive coping strategies+high maladaptive coping strategies group' (Group 4), and 'medium adaptive coping strategies+high maladaptive coping strategies group' (Group 5). Examining the differences between profiles in academic resilience, academic engagement, and academic achievement, with the exception, academic resilience, academic engagement, and academic achievement of the 'high adaptation + low maladjustment academic stress coping strategies' group and 'high adaptation + high maladaptive academic stress coping strategies' group were higher than the other groups. Based on the research results, educational interventions to help Mongolian students in Korea were discussed.
