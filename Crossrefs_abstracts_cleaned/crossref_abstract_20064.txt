AbstractAimThe aim of the study was to explore the mediating effect of resilience between learning engagement and professional identity of nursing interns.DesignA descriptive, cross‐sectional study design.MethodsAn online questionnaire survey was conducted among nursing interns in Fujian Medical University from February 2022 to April 2022 by convenience sampling. The scores of learning engagement, resilience and professional identity were evaluated. The PROCESS Marco in SPSS was used to analyse the mediating effect.ResultsA total of 222 senior nursing students participated in the questionnaire survey. Both learning engagement (r = 0.491, p < 0.01) and resilience (r = 0.537, p < 0.01) correlated positively with PI. Resilience is also positively related to PI (r = 0.693, p < 0.01). Also resilience played a partial mediating role in the relationship between learning engagement and professional identity (a*b = b = 0.2451, 95% CI: 0.1543, 0.3581), and its effect accounted for 53.3%.
