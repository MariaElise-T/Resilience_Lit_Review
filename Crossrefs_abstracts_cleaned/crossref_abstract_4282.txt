Every human being strives to land into the job of their dreams, and for many of those aspirants, civil service is that dream job. However, over the years, there has been a fundamental transformation in the public services, which has exposed civil service officers to new demands and obligations of the changing time. It is seen that between the government and the public, the civil service employees act as a connecting link. The civil services recruit a large number of candidates each year. In relation to the job, they have a lot of hopes, feelings, and expectations before getting into the job. But the harsh realities of the job makes the civil service officers undergo a lot of stress. Here comes the role of resilience, the capacity to bounce back in adverse circumstances. Human beings have varied capacity to deal with stressful situation thus different levels of resilience. Similarly the Assam Civil Service officers develop resilience over the period of service. The purpose of the present study is to study resilience in the civil service officers of Assam serving at different hierarchies based on the length of the service. A sample of 210 participants was taken for the study. Resilience was measured using a psychometric tool. The results highlighted that Resilience varied across hierarchy such that overall Resilience is significant at 1 % level with the mean score (112.92) of Senior Group I being the highest followed by the mean score of Senior Group II (111.89) followed by mean score of 107.38 of the Junior Group which is the lowest. The difference in the dimension of Perseverance is significant at 1% level as the mean score (27.73) of Junior grade is less than the other two groups. The dimension of Compassion is significant at 1 % level as compassion is less in the Junior Grade as compared to Senior Grade I and Senior Grade II. Finally, few intervention techniques have been suggested along with implications to enable further research.
