Urban agriculture has been seen as an essential strategy for enhancing food availability and reducing stress levels for urban households. This paper aims to study the benefits of urban farming and its ability as a resilient strategy, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research used primary and secondary sources to gather relevant data. Primary data was collected through interviews in June-July 2021 and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The analysis found that respondents' perception of urban farming was strongly positive. The paper finds that urban farming could be a resilient strategy since it could reduce stress and increase the community's income. Urban farming could also play a way in increasing people's immunity and health system in urban areas. Therefore, urban farming needs to be supported and assisted by the Government, specifically at the local level.
