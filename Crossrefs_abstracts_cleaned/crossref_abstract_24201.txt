Introduction: Corona virus is one of the viruses that cause respiratory infections. In addition, humans always experience fear and anxiety when faced with situations that are beyond their control. Aim: The purpose of the present study was to predict the anxiety of corona infection based on the cognitive regulation strategies of emotion, religious beliefs and resilience in students. Method: The descriptive research method is correlation type. The statistical population included all the students of Islamic Azad University, Shahrood branch in the academic year 2019-2020, and 384 students were selected as a sample using available sampling method and according to Karjesi and Morgan's table. Corona Virus Anxiety Questionnaires (2019), Cognitive Emotion Regulation (2001), Allport and Ross Religious Beliefs (1967) and Connor and Davidson Resilience (2003) have been used. To analyze the data, Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis were used with SPSS software version 26. Results: Based on the results, there is a negative relationship between cognitive emotion regulation and resilience (P<0.05) and a positive and significant relationship with religious orientation (P<0.05). Also, the regression analysis showed that 29.6% of the variance of the anxiety of contracting corona can be explained based on compatible and incompatible strategies of cognitive emotion regulation, internal and external religious orientation, and resilience. Conclusion: The results showed that the strategies of cognitive emotion regulation, religious orientation/beliefs and resilience have the ability to predict the anxiety of contracting corona virus in students and can reduce the anxiety of corona virus in students.
