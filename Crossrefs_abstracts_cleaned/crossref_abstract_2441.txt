Ensuring security in an increasingly complex and uncertain world requires states to address a number of challenges. These include the need to remain cooperative in the international space and the need to pursue their strategic objectives. Often these are followed up by intentional or unintentional threats that can effectively destabilise not only a single state, but also an entire region. Their emergence may be the result of a lack of resilience against hostile actions by state or non-state actors who, in order to achieve their objectives, undertake, among other things, hybrid activities. However, the terms ‘state resilience’ and ‘hybrid activities’ are insufficiently precisely formulated in the literature and described in a conceptual rather than a definitional manner. Both national and NATO documents lack universally accepted definitions of these terms. The aim of this article is to present the concept of building state resilience to hybrid activities.
