Burnout continues to be apparent among teachers and often leads to increased health care costs, absenteeism, and turnover rates. Burnout stems from unmanaged stress, which is the result of teachersâ€™ response to challenges in the workplace. The purpose of this cross-sectional design study was to examine the relationship between mindfulness techniques and resilience in high school teachers. An additional purpose was to examine whether the personality trait and conscientiousness moderate the relationship between mindfulness techniques and resilience. The frameworks for this study were based on the self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) framework, the theory of planned behavior, and the concepts of resilience and job burnout. Four surveys were used to gather data from 133 high school teachers to understand the relationship between mindfulness techniques and resilience as well as how conscientiousness moderates the relationship. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. This study found a significant relationship between mindfulness techniques and resilience in high school teachers. Additionally, this study found that conscientiousness does not significantly moderate the relationship between mindfulness techniques and resilience in high school teachers. These results might be used to create a professional development tool for teachers to help them learn how to increase the quality of classroom interactions and their resilience through the use of mindfulness techniques. The outcome may be a more positive social and academic environment for students as well as teachers, based on the encouraged use of mindfulness techniques.
