Stressful events in students' and teachers' personal, academic, and professional lives are widespread. The paper discusses many effective methods and techniques for correcting and preventing stress that are simple to learn and practice. They give good results in working with children, adolescents, and youths in training and education. Some practices are more complex and require more attention and effort to understand and master them, but they also have broader capabilities in various situations. Therefore, training sessions aimed at training in the prevention and correction of (di)stress conditions are very relevant and necessary. The results showed that there is a conscious and urgent need for students to reduce anxiety and stress, including ways to deal with learning stresses. Stress management can and should be structured and systematically organized, including in the instrumental sense: students need to be taught how to manage stress and themselves, increase their resistance to stress (resilience), and be trained to use different coping techniques with anxiety, as appropriate. In an empirical study, representatives of other groups of students from three Kazakh universities answered questions from three author's stress questionnaires. According to the respondents, the study results showed that students need knowledge about stress. The study showed the urgent need for special educational and training seminars, lectures, and even courses on (di)stress and physical, mental, and moral injuries and coping with them. Such classes are needed to help schoolchildren and students cope with stress and avoid problems with moral, mental, and physical health to prevent other negative consequences of school and related strains.
