Although research on the role of the gut microbiota (GM) in human health has sharply increased in recent years, what a “healthy” gut microbiota is and how it responds to major stressors is still difficult to establish. In particular, anticancer chemotherapy is known to have a drastic impact on the microbiota structure, potentially hampering its recovery with serious long-term consequences for patients’ health. However, the distinguishing features of gut microbiota recovery and non-recovery processes are not yet known. In this narrative review, we first investigated how gut microbiota layouts are affected by anticancer chemotherapy and identified potential gut microbial recovery signatures. Then, we discussed microbiome-based intervention strategies aimed at promoting resilience, i.e., the rapid and complete recovery of a healthy gut microbial network associated with a better prognosis after such high-impact pharmacological treatments.
