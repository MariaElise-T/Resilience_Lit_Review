The aims of the research are increasing resiliency of industrial process control systems, the de-velopment of methods of creating resilient industrial process control systems and creating a resil-ient control system of the distillation column for the production of food alcohol. The set of ob-jectives were achieved without the use of hardware backup, but using the developed algorithms which were based on the use of the model of dynamics of technological plants in the software of the control system and modern theory of multivariable automatic control systems. The opti-mal linear-quadratic controller with disturbances model and a state observer was used as a full controller. The most important result was improvement of the survivability of industrial process control systems using the developed algorithm. Also, the resilient distillation column control sys-tem was developed. For the further researches significant results are formulas which allow de-fining new mode values of controls in a distillation column at failure event of corresponding control output channels and formulas of logic algebra for a choice of optimum configuration of control system of a distillation column of food spirit industry. The basis of the developed tech-nique was reconfiguration of the control system with inclusion, instead of the failed, additional devices, which were not being used in a current configuration, but were carried out the similar function taking into account dynamics coupling of a technological plant. The significance of these results is that they can be applied to the development of cyber-production systems that do not require permanent maintenance by personnel.
