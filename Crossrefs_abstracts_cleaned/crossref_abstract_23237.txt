Objectives  The purpose of this study was to confirm the mediating effect of emotional clarity and self-compassion, in the relationship between resilience and father's and motherâ€™s empathic emotional response perceived by undergraduate university students.
Methods  An online survey sampled a total of 501 students (247 men and, 254 women), enrolled in undergraduate university programs across the country were surveyed. Data was collected online form 1 June to 30 June 21 2021, and Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 25, to estimate the relationship between variables. The structural equation model was analyzed using the Mplus 8.6.
Results  The results of the study are as follows. First, there was a meaningful correlation between the resilience of university students, paternal empathy and maternal empathy, emotional clarity, and self-compassion variables. Second, emotional clarity had a mediating effect in the relationship between paternal and maternal empathy, and resilience perceived by university students. Third, looking at the mediating effect of self-compassion in the relationship between father's and mother's and resilience perceived by university students, self-compassion had a mediating effect in the relationship between father's empathy and resilience, but it did not have the same effect in the relationship between mother's empathy and resilience. Fourth, it was confirmed that, in the relationship between father and mother's empathy and resilience perceived by university students, emotional clarity and self-compassion were sequentially double mediated to affect resilience.
Conclusions  This study confirmed the necessity of preparing university students' counseling and educational programs through the factors that influence resilience.
