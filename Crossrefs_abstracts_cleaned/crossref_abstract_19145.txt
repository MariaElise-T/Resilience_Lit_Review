The child’s developmental characteristics influence the psycho-social features in the behavior of parents. This aspect is relevant in building effective strategies for psychological and socio-educational assistance to parents for an increased quality of family life. The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in anxiety, stress, and resilience strategies in the case of parents with children with late psychosocial development and those with children with neurotypical development. The research sample consisted of 620 subjects (380 women, 240 men, divided into two equal categories: parents of children with late development and with neurotypical development). The questionnaire survey (Levenstein’s Perceived Stress Questionnaire for stress and Hobfoll’s Strategic Approach to Coping Scale for resilience strategies) and interview (Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale for anxiety) were used. The anxiety levels did not differ significantly (t = 0.45, p = 0.65), but there were differences in the perceived stress levels (t = −7.10, p = 0.03). As for resilience strategies, significant differences were found for assertive action, social communion, precautionary action, and seeking social support, which were more pronounced strategies that were used by parents of children with late psychosocial development.
