While contingency planning may provide a perspective for anticipating critical incidents, supply chain managers must develop competencies to address the long‐term disruptions that stem from both natural and man‐made disasters. The broad‐reaching nature of disasters brings public and private entities together and often requires collaboration to revitalize disrupted supply chains. Leveraging supply chain governance logic through the dual lenses of resource management and competing values, a research framework is introduced to address the nature of public–private short‐term collaboration and its influence on supply chain resilience. The largely unstudied concept of short‐term collaboration is at the heart of a model focusing on the alignment and adjustment of potentially disparate organizational values (public/private) to establish collective responsiveness while facilitating the fulfillment of mutual goals for a single event and/or discrete repeat events. We offer research propositions pertaining to the model and conclude with a discussion of managerial implications and the dire need for future research.
