In South Asia, agriculture is pivotal for food and nutritional security and the livelihood of more than 50% of the population. Food production and nutritional security pressures intensify as urbanisation decreases the agricultural land area amid population growth. Climate change complicates this scenario by introducing elevated temperatures, extreme climatic events, surging sea levels, and increased soil salinity. Identifying climate-resilient innovative technologies for farmer adoption becomes imperative to counter these adversities. An integrated approach to climate-smart agriculture, encompassing capacity building through practical training on innovative mitigation strategies, is needed. This study unites experts from Australia, India, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan in an Asia-Pacific Network project, fostering mutual learning and farmer training in climate-smart practices. Insights from workshops conducted at Amity University in February 2020 and June 2022, combined with country-specific technological advances in the past 15 years gleaned from the literature, revealed key technologies to combat climate change (e.g., zero tillage, raised bed planting, direct-seeded rice, crop residue management, crop diversification, site-specific nutrient management, laser levelling, micro-irrigation, seed/fodder banks, and ICT-based weather advisories). Widespread implementation of these technologies and practices will empower farmers to navigate climate change challenges, fostering resilience and sustainability.
