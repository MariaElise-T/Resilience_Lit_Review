A Complex Adaptive System (CAS) is a system that refers to the interactions of several independent agents having different characteristics, which leads to an emergent feature that is often difficult (or impossible) to predict simply by looking at the individual interactions. “Complex” in CAS also refers to the vast interconnectedness of these systems that go beyond the limits to separate disciplines that will have an obscure effect on future science, engineering, and industry as well as in the management of our planet’s resources. This paper attempts to determine the emergent behavior that would result in the interaction among countries having attributes such as the Technological Achievement Index (TAI) and CO2 emissions using a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) approach. A global database containing these attributes was retrieved across 135 countries as of 2015. The consequences of the TAI and the CO2 emissions of the countries were discussed to understand this study’s objective. The interactions of the two attributes were measured with the use of a synergy calculator software that shows a graphical representation of connections. A histogram of the connections was produced resulting in three equally distributed frequencies. These frequencies were used to group the agents into three clusters. The emergent features for each cluster were determined by describing their scatterplots. The evidence shows that the countries in Clusters 1 and 3 possess sustainable and resilient technologies, while Cluster 2 has otherwise. This paper shows a new method of examining resiliency using TAI and CO2 emissions using the CAS approach.
