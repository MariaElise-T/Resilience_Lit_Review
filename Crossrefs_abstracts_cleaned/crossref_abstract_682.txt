BackgroundSince cardiovascular diseases remain the main cause of premature mortality in men and women in Poland, it is reasonable to look for factors that protect against these conditions. Psychological resiliency is one of such properties that support adaptation in difficult situations and conducive to adaptation to the disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between resiliency and flexibility in coping of cardiac patients and to determine whether resiliency is a predictor of flexibility in coping with stress in this group.Participants and procedureIn the study the Assessment of Resiliency Scale (SPP-25) and the scale of Flexibility in Coping with Stress (KERS-14) were used. The participants of the study were 120 cardiac patients (72 men and 48 women) at the age 29-75.ResultsThe results show that there is a statistically significant relationship between resiliency and flexibility in coping. Each of the resiliency dimensions, as well as the result of the overall resiliency, correlates positively with each of the dimensions of flexibility in coping. The analysis showed that resiliency is an important predictor of a dependent variable – flexible in coping.ConclusionsThere is a positive relationship between resiliency and flexibility in coping with stress in cardiac patients. Peo-ple with a higher intensity of resiliency in comparison to people with lower intensity of resiliency are character-ized by greater flexibility in coping with stress. The dimensions of resiliency, in particular ‘Persistence and de-termination in action’ and ‘Openness to new experiences and sense of humor’, together with the duration of the disease, play a predictive role for flexibility in coping with stress.
