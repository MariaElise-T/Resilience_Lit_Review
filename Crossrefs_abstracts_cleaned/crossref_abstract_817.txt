 Information about the psychological status of children following a natural disaster is rare. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to create a psychosocial profile of relocated Hurricane Katrina youth ( N = 83, ages 13 to 17) and integrate the findings into a growing body of literature on the psychological effects of disaster. Data were collected using the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents. Findings indicate the population had overall below-average resiliency resources. The greatest of these resources are reflected in their ability to maintain a positive attitude, ask for and receive help, and solve problems. Other resiliency strengths emerged in the form of feeling calm and comfortable with people. Findings also indicate the population as showing above-average vulnerability and sensitivity to psychosomatic reactions, including high levels of impairment by and recovery from emotional upset. Suggestions for intervention are aimed at meaningful social support activities that emphasize the rebuilding of community via outdoor adventure education and service learning.
