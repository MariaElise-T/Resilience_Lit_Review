AbstractA paucity of nursing literature is available on disaster‐related community resilience. Using a nursing method for analyzing concepts, this article attempts to clarify the meaning of this novel concept to encourage nursing research and practice. This concept analysis provides an introduction to the phenomenon of disaster‐related community resilience for nurses and consumers of nursing research. The article proposes the definition, antecedents, attributes, consequences, and empirical referents of disaster‐related community resilience and provides suggestions for nursing research and practice. It also provides nurses a foundation for participating in resilience‐building activities that may save lives and allow communities to recover more rapidly postdisaster.
