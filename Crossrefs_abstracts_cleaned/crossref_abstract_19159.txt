AbstractEvery decision made in the classroom has the potential to either help or hurt a student’s development as a learner. When students’ mental and emotional well-being are taken into account, effective instruction and assessment are possible, despite the importance of learners’ engagement in assessment (LEA), test-taking skills (TTS), self-assessment (SA), learner resilience (LR), and learner autonomy (LA). As a result, this study attempted to illustrate the dynamic between LEA, TTS, SA, LR, and LA. To this end, 435 English as a foreign language (EFL) students at intermediate levels in Afghanistan were given copies of the Test-taking Skills Scale (TTSS), the core of self‑assessments questionnaire (CSAQ), The Academic Resilience Scale (ARS), the learner autonomy questionnaire (LAQ), and the learner engagement in on-line assessment (LEOA). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) screening of the data revealed that resilient EFL students feel better at on-line assessment and in pursuing their objectives. The mediating effects of TTS and SA on LR and LA and consequently Engagement in On-line Assessment were specifically identified. The survey’s ramifications, which may improve language learning and assessment, are reviewed at length.
