This paper presents a new concept concerning the development of eco-resilient concrete constructions, that is to say constructions with a reduced carbon footprint and which can withstand mechanical stress and physico-chemical attacks worsened by climate change. After a critical analysis of current research and development policies in the field of concrete construction, a new global approach is proposed which should allow this concrete construction profession to better respond to the challenges caused by global warming. This approach is based on two strong ideas a) The use of fiber concretes in combination with passive or active reinforcements in all constructions susceptible to crack b) The use of numerical models based on non-linear finite element calculations in order to optimize the design of eco-resilient concrete constructions.
