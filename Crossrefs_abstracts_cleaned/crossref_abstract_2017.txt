Using a sequential exploratory mixed‐methods design, this research examined the role of national values on perceived organizational and employee resilience in times of disaster. First, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 13 Filipino employees and leaders involved in disaster response in six organizations. Thematic analysis revealed bayanihan, malasakit, pananagutan, and volunteerism as values relevant to the disaster response and management efforts of organizations. The Manifestations of Filipino National Values for Disaster in Organizational Management scale was then constructed reflecting these four national values in order to examine the relationship of these values with perceived organizational and employee resilience. In total, 221 employees from various industries participated in the survey. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed a full mediation model wherein except for pananagutan, the national values of bayanihan, malasakit, and volunteerism significantly predicted employee resilience through perceived organizational resilience. These findings indicate that employee resilience can be enhanced not only through personal resources, but also by drawing on organizational and sociocultural resources accessible to employees in times of disaster. Implications for resilience and disaster literature and resilience‐building efforts of organizations are discussed.
