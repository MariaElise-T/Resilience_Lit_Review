Objective: Analyze the concept of resilience as an agroecosystem property to deal with the possible outcomes of climate change.
Methodology: The literature was analyzed concerning concepts of resilience, vulnerability, climate change scenarios and agroecosystems resilience.
Results: The resilience is an emergent property and is part of the agroecosystem trajectory, and it also is closely related with the adaptability and self-learning capacity.
Limitations of the study: The strengthening of weak elements should be encouraged and promoted the agroecosystem controller feedback to increase his adaptive capacities.
Conclusions: Promotion of agroecosystems resilience must start by integrating indicators in environmental, governance, risk assessment, knowledge and education dimensions, management and vulnerability reduction, and preparedness and response for disasters.
