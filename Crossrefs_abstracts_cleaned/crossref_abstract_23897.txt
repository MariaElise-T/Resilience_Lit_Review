Problem context. Corporate culture (CC) of an organization is often represented by implicit factors in research models, the measurement of which poses a significant challenge in terms of accuracy and reliability. However, there is a high demand for such measurements (direct or indirect), particularly in analyzing and forecasting the organization’s level of economic resilience. Research objective. This study aims to establish a link between the corporate culture of an organization and its economic resilience by proposing adequate measures of corporate culture quality. Research methodology. The process of modeling an organization using a normalized system of balanced indicators (NSBI) consisting of 64 indicators across 7 strategic perspectives is described. The relationships between indicators in the NSBI model are inherently fuzzy in nature. By quantitatively measuring these indicators, the quality of CC can be assessed through a reverse process. Results. Three cases are presented where the indicators of “CC Quality” and business efficiency are directly linked using fuzzy logic. Conclusion. An approach is presented that establishes a connection between the quality of corporate culture and the level of organizational resilience through a normalized multi-layered NSBI.
