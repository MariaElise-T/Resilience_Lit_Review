AbstractAn information‐resilient society requires the development of a resilient information science. Three different requirements for resilient information science are identified and a constructive contribution presented for each. First the scope and available resources need to be fully identified. Wayne de Fremery draws on his forthcoming book on the bibliographical foundations of information science to suggest how humanistic forms of bibliography can provide resources that support information science. Second, clarity in concepts and definitions is required. Michael Buckland draws on recent work to bring clarity to the centrally important but notoriously unclear topic of “relevance.” Third, concepts and techniques need to be articulated as new technologies emerge. A presentation on access to the evidence behind the news by Olivier Le Deuff will illustrate how the publication of articles can now be enriched with the publication of related evidence, now a critical need with the rise of fake news. A moderated discussion follows.
