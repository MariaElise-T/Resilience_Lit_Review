Although Chile is one of the countries most exposed to natural hazards, to date there is no national index that shows the differences in resilience levels within the country. This study develops a community resilience index on a national scale based on the Baseline Resilience Community (BRIC) index. The BRIC index for Chile was built with 49 indicators, from different sources at the district level. Our results determined that resilience is not distributed homogeneously throughout the country. The highest levels of resilience are concentrated in the central macro-zone. In comparison, the extreme zones of Chile focus close to 90% of their population in the lowest levels, accounting for an uneven distribution of resources and services that impact resilience levels. These differences were mainly explained by indicators such as the percentage of the population without a health insurance system, the percentage of the population without internet access, and the percentage of electoral participation, among others. The results demonstrate that the BRIC model can be successfully implemented to assess community resilience in Chile and suggests the possibility of targeting resources and strategies to increase resilience in areas with the lowest levels of community resilience.
