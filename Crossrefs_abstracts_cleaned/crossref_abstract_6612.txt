SummaryThe negative effects of parental mental illness on children are not dependent on the parent's diagnosis, but are related to that parent's behaviour, the responses of other key adults (both familial and professional), and the degree to which development of the child's resilience has been encouraged. Parental mental illness can be responsible for serious interruptions in a child's cognitive and emotional development, which in turn can have implications for their future mental health. Resilience can be promoted by relatively simple interventions, but these require the active participation of both adult- and child-focused professionals involved with the family, particularly those concerned with the parent's treatment.
