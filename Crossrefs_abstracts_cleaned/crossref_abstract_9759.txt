 During the past two decades, increased research attention has been directed toward understanding the adolescent who is confronted with challenges such as poverty or substance abuse. Accordingly, pediatric oncology nurse researchers and clinicians are increasingly becoming interested in understanding the experience of resilience in the adolescent with cancer. Research and clinical reports have shown that many adolescents with cancer are resilient even though they experience multiple stressors. That is, even in the face of adversity, they develop into well-adapted individuals. The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual understanding of resilience in adolescents with cancer. Areas that are addressed include the following: (a) an historical overview of the major theoretical paradigms used to understand the pediatric cancer experience; (b) a summary of definitional issues related to the construct of resilience; and (c) a conceptual model of resilience. New insights are provided that may lead pediatric oncology nurse researchers and clinicians to examine resilience in the adolescent with cancer from a variety of perspectives.
