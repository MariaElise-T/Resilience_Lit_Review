In this paper, we provide a literature review on the topic of organizational resilience, in relation to the energy crisis. The concept of organizational resilience refers to the capability to respond and adapt to shocks. Undoubtedly, the recent energy crisis may be considered an external shock, as it has raised energy prices and exerts a significant pressure on decision makers. Although the energy crisis has impacted organizations significantly in recent months, there is little knowledge on how companies should respond to this threat. Thus, to fill in this research gap, we apply the method of a systematic literature review (SLR), combined with text mining tools, to map the topics covered by 124 works in the field. Based on our results, we uncover several important gaps in the existing studies. We also provide suggestions on relevant future research directions that could broaden the scope of the management of energy crisis, in line with the concept of organizational resilience.
