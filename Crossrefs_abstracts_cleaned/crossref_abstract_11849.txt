ObjectivesThe purpose of the article was an attempt to answer the question of the impact of murals created in Polish public space on building social resilience in the era of war in Ukraine.MethodsThe methodology of the conducted research was based on non-reactive research.ResultsThe results of the research showed the very rapid reactions of mural artists to the war in Ukraine. Works created in public space included both grassroots initiatives and mural painting supported by public entities and NGOs. Of interest was the presence of murals in public spaces in cities of different sizes, and the fact that they were created by both anonymous artists and authors who specialized in street art and were well-known in the community. Content analysis showed that the murals stigmatized the aggressor (Russia) and upheld the victim of the attack (Ukraine). They showed the heroism and bravery of Ukrainians, but also the trauma that war brings to hundreds of thousands of civilians and a country fighting for freedom. The murals showed who represents "good" and who represents "evil" in the ongoing conflict.ConclusionsThe murals were one of the instruments for building the social resilience of Poles against Russia's propaganda. Russia was presented on them as an aggressor, Ukraine as an invaded country. The message of the murals resonated in public spaces, but also in media spaces (newspapers, TV) and the Internet. Hence, their significance was broader than merely being present in the public spaces of individual cities.
