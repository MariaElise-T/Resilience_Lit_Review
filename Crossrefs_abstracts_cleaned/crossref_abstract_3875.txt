Tourism is one of the economic activities most affected by changes and uncertain conditions. This is evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected tourism and travel activities, resulting in a decrease in hotel occupancy rates. While hospitality performance is expected to take several years to recover, the industry landscape has likely changed forever. Hotels that have actively used resilience strategies are the most likely to survive the pandemic and shape the future of the industry. The main predictor of organizational resilience is employee resilience. The aim of this study is to determine the level of hotel employee resilience in Medan, Indonesia. We used One-Way ANOVA analysis and descriptive statistics. Using sample data obtained from 362 hotel employees in Medan, Indonesia, we found that the majority of the subjects are highly resilience.
