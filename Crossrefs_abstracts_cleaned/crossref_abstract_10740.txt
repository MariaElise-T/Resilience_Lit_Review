This research was carried out to explore the gender differences in resilience, coping and quality of life of oncology nurses. It is evidenced through the literature that oncology nurses face different stressors because of complexity involved in their profession. This research attempts to investigate the impact of resilience and coping strategies on quality of life of nurses along with identifying nature of gender differences in each domain. A total of 300 oncology nurses (150 males and 150 females) participated in cross sectional survey based study. Trait and State Resilience Checklist, Brief Cope Scale and WHO Quality of Life scale were used to assess resilience, coping strategies and quality of life respectively. Results indicated significant gender differences in terms of coping strategies and quality of life. Moreover, resilience came out to be a strong predictor of quality of life in nurses. Findings of the study are discussed in terms of policy towards nursing stress management and coping intervention.
