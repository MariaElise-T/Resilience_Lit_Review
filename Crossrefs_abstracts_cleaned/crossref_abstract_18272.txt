Introduction: Burnout syndrome is a condition caused by chronic stress at the workplace. Resilience is the ability to cope with the negative situations in life. Purpose: To evaluate the extent of burnout syndrome in nursing teachers at medical high schools and the effect of the level of resilience on burnout syndrome. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study interviewed 101 nursing teachers at four medical schools. Teacher Burnout Scale, The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and socio-demographic questionnaire have been used as instruments of the study. Results: The majority of nursing teachers had moderate symptom of burnout syndrome. The average result on the burnout scale was 56.1. Statistical analyzes showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the manifestation of burnout syndrome in teachers in relation to demographic characteristics (sex, marital status, years of work experience and subjects at medical school). By analysing the results of the two scales, it has been established that there is no statistically significant association between the burnout intensity and the degree of resilience in nursing teachers. Conclusion: The results of the study showed moderate level of burnout in nursing teachers. This may help as an encouragement to develop a strategy for preventing emergence of the burnout syndrome. The results will be useful for further research of burnout syndrome in nursing teachers.
