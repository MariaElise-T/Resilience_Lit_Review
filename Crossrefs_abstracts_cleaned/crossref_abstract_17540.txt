 Although there is a plethora of research on resiliency, there are few studies that examine this concept in Latino immigrant families in the United States. Using key terms such as immigrant, Hispanic, Latino, and resiliency, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify characteristics of resilience and understand how these factors uniquely protect Latino immigrant families against stressors related to the migration and assimilation processes. Research on resilience among Latino immigrant families indicates 4 major domains: individual characteristics, family strengths, cultural factors, and community supports. A deeper understanding of how these risk and protective factors contribute to resilience with Latino immigrant families will increase the cultural competence of policy, practice, and research with this population. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
