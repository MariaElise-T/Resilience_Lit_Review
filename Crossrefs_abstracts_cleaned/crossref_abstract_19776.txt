AbstractThe purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model for perceived competence and to obtain an integrator evaluation of the nursing curriculum with measures of nursing self‐efficacy, general self‐efficacy, resilience, and stress among nursing students. A correlational study with nursing students (N = 265) from the degree in nursing was conducted. A factor analysis was used to test the construct validity of nursing self‐efficacy and perceived competence. The correlational and discriminant analyses evaluated the factors in the four academic levels of the degree (2016–2017) to identify the variables involved in the classification of the students in each level. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of nursing self‐efficacy and perceived competence revealed a statistically significant good fit and consistency. Nursing self‐efficacy, general self‐efficacy, resilience, and year of the degree course predicted 34% of perceived competence scores. The discriminant function of nursing self‐efficacy, perceived competence, and resilience classified 76% of participants in the first and last years of the degree. Nursing self‐efficacy, perceived competence, and resilience increased with academic level. They help chart nursing students' progress through the curriculum.
