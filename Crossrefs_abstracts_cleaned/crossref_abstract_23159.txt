ABSTRACT Losses in agricultural production, mainly caused by extreme temperature, rainfall and drought, have demanded the adaptation of the Brazilian agriculture to the ongoing climate change. This study aimed to evaluate, through an integrative review, the effects of agricultural practices established by two Brazilian public policies (ABC Plan and Planaveg) on the resilience and adaptation of the countryâ€™s agricultural systems, considering the effects on local climate and extreme events. All the Embrapa library collections were used as main sources, and the Google Scholar was used as a secondary source. The search included publications from 1998 to April 2022 and resulted in 334 data, extracted from 51 references, covering at least one factor and one practice. The review showed that the proposed practices may contribute to the resilience and adaptation of the Brazilian agricultural and forestry sectors to climate change in the main production regions. Studies have indicated that the incorporation of the arboreal component into production systems may provide an environment more resilient to droughts, increased air humidity, reduced temperature impact and reduced fire risks, among other benefits. The adoption of the ABC Plan and Planaveg practices by the agricultural sector is an option feasible, strategic and well-aligned with a low-carbon economy, while it increases the resilience to present and future climate change impacts.
