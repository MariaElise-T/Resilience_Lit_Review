AbstractThis study examined happiness and satisfaction as possible foundations for long‐term well‐being and resilience in dental education. Psychological research has found that respect, camaraderie, and trust help define well‐being and that resilience is built with these supportive influences. The aims of this study were to assess if happiness and life satisfaction reported by one U.S. dental school's faculty, students, and alumni also enhanced their perceived well‐being and resilience and to determine the factor that most affected the participants’ happiness. Email and hard copy surveys were distributed in 2018 and 2019 to all 71 full‐time preclinical and clinical faculty members, 572 students in all four years, and 143 alumni who graduated in 2018 (total N = 786). Overall, 471 responded; response rates by group were as follows: faculty 87.3% (N = 62), students 65.9% (N = 377), and graduates 22.4% (N = 32). Of the three groups, responding faculty members reported having the highest levels of happiness in life (92.0%) and job satisfaction (90.3%). In the highest percentage reported, 90.2% of D4 students reported that the level of trust and respect they received from clinical faculty members contributed most to their happiness. The lowest level of happiness among the groups (71.0%) was reported by the D2 students. These results suggested that perceived well‐being translated to happiness among the participants in our study. More research is needed to understand the relationship among positive environments, well‐being, and provider resilience in dental education.
