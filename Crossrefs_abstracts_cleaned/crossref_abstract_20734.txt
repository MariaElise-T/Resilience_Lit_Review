 Based on Identity Process Theory, we hypothesised that two elements of identity resilience (identity worth and identity continuity) differentially predict variance in COVID-19 fear and risk, science mistrust, vaccine positivity, and vaccination likelihood. Data from an online survey of 643 UK and 485 Portuguese adults collected during March 2021 showed the UK and Portuguese did not differ significantly on vaccination likelihood or identity resilience. UK respondents reported less science mistrust, COVID-19 risk, and fear, but higher vaccine positivity than the Portuguese. Identity worth and identity continuity differed between countries in their effects on science mistrust, COVID-19 fear, risk, vaccine positivity and vaccination likelihood. Science mistrust and COVID-19 fear proved key factors in predicting vaccine positivity and vaccination likelihood. We conclude the roles of discrete elements of identity resilience in health behaviour require further examination and action reducing prevalence of specific forms of science mistrust can improve vaccination likelihood.
