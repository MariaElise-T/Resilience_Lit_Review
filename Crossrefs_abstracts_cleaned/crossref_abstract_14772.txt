ObjectiveThe current study aimed to examine the economic impact of COVID‐19 virus on family dynamics and college‐age children's mental health in China and to identity personal and social or relational resilience factors that could buffer the negative consequences of COVID‐19.BackgroundSince an outbreak of COVID‐19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college‐age young adult children.MethodUsing a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parent–child interactions, and individual well‐being during COVID‐19.ResultsResults from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID‐19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self‐control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parent–child interactions.ConclusionFindings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID‐19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts.ImplicationsImplications to family researchers, family life educators, practitioners, and policymakers were discussed.
