Abstract
Flooding is not an uncommon phenomenon that occurs yearly in Malaysia. In fact, in the last few decades, the event of floods in Malaysia has become a disaster and has negatively impacted human wellbeing. Disaster Resilience Education (DRE) is one of the initiatives to prepare the community towards the unpredictable event of a disaster, including the flood. Therefore, this study will explore the Disaster Resilience Education (DRE) programmes that have been conducted in a secondary school at Tanah Merah, Kelantan. A questionnaire was adopted as the research instrument to collect data from respondents. A total of 200 respondents which consisted of students, teachers, and administrative staffs, had participated in this study. The stratified sampling approach was applied in this study to select the respondents. Descriptive and inferential analysis were executed to explore the DRE programmes that had been conducted, in order to identify the school’s community awareness on DRE and the factors that influence the school’s community awareness. This study has revealed that there is a minimal number of DRE programmes that have been conducted by the school. However, the awareness level of the school community on DRE is good. This study has found that different socio-demographic factors have a significant influence on the school’s community awareness on DRE. Therefore, the finding from this study is crucial for the local authority and government, to enhance the resilience programme in school.
