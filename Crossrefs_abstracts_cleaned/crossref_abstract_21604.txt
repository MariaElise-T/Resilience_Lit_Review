Transport networks play a critical role for living communities, as they facilitate the exchange of people and goods and foster economic growth. Improving their resilience against seismic hazards, among which liquefaction is by far one of the most significant and complex, is consistent with most of the Sustainable Development Goals pinpointed by the United Nationsâ€™ Agenda. In this paper, an original methodological framework, combining innovative Geo-statistical approaches to analyze soil properties, prediction models for soil liquefaction, and calibrated transport demand models providing the social and economic cost associated with seismic-induced road damages and closures within a renewed Geographical Information Systems (GIS) workspace, is proposed. In particular, based on traditional risk assessment evaluation, an innovative approach to evaluate the exposure in terms of economic loss due to lack of accessibility is presented. The methodology is applied to a district area in northern Italy that underwent a recent seismic event that caused several soil liquefaction phenomena. Results provided by a sensitivity analysis on a stochastic (return period) basis are derived: as the seismic intensity increases, the total social costs increase, but the trend of the rates due to traffic delays and the loss of accessibility are irregular. Although further simulation scenarios need to be undertaken, the proposed methodology seems to provide an effective planning tool to evaluate preventive strategies aimed at improving the resilience of transport networks against liquefaction risk.
