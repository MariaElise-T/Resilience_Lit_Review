This study describes the implementation of an energy sector community to examine the practice of cybersecurity for operational technology environments and their supply chains. Evaluating cybersecurity from the perspectives of different actors participating in the energy sector, the progress and challenges of operators and suppliers in delivering cybersecurity for the sector are explored. While regulatory frameworks incentivize individual organizations to improve their cybersecurity, operational services contain contributions from many organizations, and this supply chain of activity needs to be influenced and managed to achieve desired security and resilience outcomes. Through collaborations and systems engineering approaches, a reference model is created to facilitate improvements in managing the cybersecurity of supply chains for different actors, including service operators, maintainers, manufacturers, and systems integrators. This study provides an illustration of implementing a common vision of cybersecurity improvement across a community of actors. It utilizes a collaborative framework that has facilitated the co-production of cybersecurity guidance for energy sector participants.
