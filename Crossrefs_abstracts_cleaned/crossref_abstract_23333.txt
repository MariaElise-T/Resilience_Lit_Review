The development of settlements in Vojvodina is burdened by numerous problems,
   both environmental and social, which seriously jeopardize their path towards
   resilience. The effects of climate changes have been identified mostly in the
   form of floods, inundations and prolonged droughts affecting agriculture as
   the dominant activity in the region. On the other hand, settlements in
   Vojvodina, especially small towns and villages, suffer from chronic
   depopulation and the 'emptying' effect. Naturally, this transfers its
   consequences to major cities and the entire regional network of settlements.
   In this article we will focus on a particular type of settlement in Vojvodina
   - small towns, specific because of their urban-rural character and their
   significance within the above-mentioned issues. What are the possibilities
   for this type of settlement to improve its ecological resilience, a property
   that is the conditio sine qua non of sustainability? Our assumption is that
   small towns, due to their hybrid urban-rural character, possess sufficient
   flexibility and polyvalence to take on the role of the 'fluid object' i.e.
   the mediator that allows the proliferation of relational objects between
   urban and rural areas, and that will allow spatial resilience of the entire
   network of settlements. We will use the concept of spatial resilience in
   order to extend the question of ecological resilience of one type of
   settlement to the entire network of towns.
