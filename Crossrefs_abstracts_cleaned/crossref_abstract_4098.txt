This paper delves into the concept of social metabolism as a foundation for the development of sociotechnical systems in Industry 5.0. The study conducts an analysis of the existing methods and approaches for designing sociotechnical systems, and reviews publications that utilize such systems to incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies into manufacturing processes. Additionally, it examines the three key factors of Industry 5.0 and the enabling framework of Industry 4.0 technologies. Based on these investigations, a theoretical model is proposed for manufacturing system design, employing sociotechnical systems to integrate Industry 4.0 enabling technologies, while considering the essential aspects of Industry 5.0. The model emphasizes the early consideration of sociotechnical systems to design manufacturing systems that prioritize human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. By embracing this comprehensive approach, the proposed model contributes to the realization of a production environment aligned with societal needs, fostering a more conscious and adaptable industry.
