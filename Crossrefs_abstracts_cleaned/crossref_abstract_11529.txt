Studying in a foreign country is a big challenge for many international students. They face many difficulties in adapting to an unfamiliar situation. Under such circumstances, they need good resilience to overcome and bounce back from these difficulties. This study aims to explore (i) the problems encountered by international Burmese female students while studying abroad and (ii) the factors contributing to their resilience to continue pursuing their graduate degrees. Four Burmese female students studying at one university in China were purposely chosen and interviewed for this study. Findings showed that they mostly encountered language and academic problems and psychological distress at the beginning of their studies, but they adjusted well and were able to overcome these problems. Moreover, both internal (e.g., optimism and self-confidence) and external factors (e.g., social support and religious practices) were important in the development of their resilience to survive in a foreign country and continue pursuing their graduate studies.
