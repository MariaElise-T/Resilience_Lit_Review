Zimbabwe has endured economic, socio-political and biophysical environmental changes that have resulted in ecotourism facing significant challenges. The Mahenye community ecotourism project has however, managed to withstand these challenges over time. This research sought to analyse the factors influencing the resilience of community ecotourism at Mahenye, Chipinge District, southeast Zimbabwe from 1982 to 2020. Research methods included desktop research, key informant interviews, critical content analysis, observations and researchersâ€™ prior knowledge about Mahenye. The factors influencing ecotourism resilience at Mahenye included resource richness and attractiveness, tourism-product diversification, intra-communal cohesiveness, social energy, a supportive private sector and non-governmental organizations and management of risk factors. These factors ensured that the venture remained operational despite socio-economic, political and biophysical change. It is hoped the resilience lessons and experiences from Mahenye can be shared and adapted to enhance the success of other similar ecotourism ventures under changing operating environments.
