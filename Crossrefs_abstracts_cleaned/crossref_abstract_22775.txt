ABSTRACT
We demonstrate that the sessile tunicate Botryllus schlosseri is remarkably resilient to applied loads by attaching the animals to an extensile substrate subjected to quasistatic equiradial loads. Animals can withstand radial extension of the substrate to strain values as high as 20% before they spontaneously detach. In the small to moderate strain regime, we found no relationship between the dynamic size of the external vascular bed and the magnitude of applied stretch, despite known force sensitivities of the vascular tissue at the cellular level. We attribute this resilience to the presence and mechanical properties of the tunic, the cellulose-enriched gel-like substance that encases the animal bodies and surrounding vasculature.
