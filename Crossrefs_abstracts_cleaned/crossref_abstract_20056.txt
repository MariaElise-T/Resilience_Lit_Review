AbstractThe individual process of resilience has been related to positive outcomes in mental disorders. We aimed (a) to identify the resilience domains from the Resilience Questionnaire for Bipolar Disorder that are associated cross sectionally and longitudinally with mental health outcomes in bipolar disorder (BD) and (b) to explore cross‐lagged associations among resilience factors. A clinical adult sample of 125 patients diagnosed with BD (62.10% female, mean age = 46.13, SD = 10.89) gave their informed consent and completed a battery of disease‐specific tools on resilience, personal recovery, symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life, at baseline and at follow‐up (n = 63, 58.10% female, mean age = 45.13, SD = 11.06, participation rate = 50.40%). Resilience domains of self‐management of BD, turning point, self‐care, and self‐confidence were significantly associated with mental health indicators at baseline. In addition, self‐confidence at baseline directly predicted an increase in personal recovery at follow‐up, and self‐confidence improvement mediated the relationship between interpersonal support and self‐care at baseline and personal recovery at follow‐up. These findings highlight that resilience domains are significantly associated with positive mental health outcomes in BD and that some predict personal recovery at follow‐up. Moreover, some resilience factors improve other resilience factors over time.
