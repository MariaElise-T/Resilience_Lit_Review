Abstract
Urban flood is growing worldwide due to climate change, rapid urbanization and population increase. Although the concept of resilience is an effective tool to deal with urban flood, urban flood resilience remains difficult to put into practice nowadays. The attenuation process of urban flood control capacity under the influence of flood is still a challenge. And the stage damage of flood resilience is strongly linked with the recovery of urban system to floods. But current studies failed to capture the change characteristic of flood resilience in time stage. Therefore, this study made stage damage analysis based on flood simulation and modelling in Jianye and Gulou District. Results reveal that Jianye has the higher inundated area and exposed population and asset to flood. Gulou shows more resilience to urban flood with flood return periods of 100 years. Moreover, the stage damage curve benefits the comprehensive understanding of loss and recovery process. This study provides a theoretical support for effective adaptive strategy to urban flood.
