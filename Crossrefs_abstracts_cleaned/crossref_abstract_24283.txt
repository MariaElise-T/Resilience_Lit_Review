            Modern coral reefs and associated biodiversity are severely threatened by increasing terrestrial runoff. Similar scenarios could be suspected for geological times, but reef coral resilience is still an enigma. In late Visean-Serpukhovian (Mississippian foraminiferal zones/MFZ 14-16) times, a major glaciation phase of the late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) associated with enhanced terrestrial weathering and runoff coincides with a biodiversity crisis and coral reef decline. In this study, the impact of enhanced terrestrial runoff is tested on size variations of colonial corals
            Aulina rotiformis
            and
            Lithostrotion decipiens
            along a gradient of contemporaneous (Serpukhovian) open marine carbonate to near-shore siliciclastic facies in South China. Along this gradient, their sizes decrease from carbonate, through intermediate carbonate-siliciclastic, to siliciclastic facies. This is consistent with increasing abundance of terrestrial materials of high silicon, aluminium and phosphorus values. On a larger million-year-long interval (MFZ14-16) and for several palaeocontinents, size data of
            Lithostrotion decipiens
            and
            Siphonodendron pauciradiale
            show a distinct decline in late Visean, when enhanced terrestrial weathering occurred commonly with palaeosols developed during regression. This suggests that terrestrial sediment and nutrient input may have mainly controlled phenotypic plasticity in Mississippian reef corals, with a decrease in size as a component of resilience across the LPIA onset.
