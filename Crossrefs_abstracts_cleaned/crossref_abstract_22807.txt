Background: Human resilience is dynamic and generated through myriad interactions starting from early childhood. Resilience can improve quality of life and longevity. Objective: The current analysis evaluates childhood resilience at 9 years of age and its associations with concurrent cognition and early childhood factors, using longitudinal follow-up of a community birth cohort in Vellore, south India. Methods: Resilience was assessed using the Child and Youth Resilience Measure and cognition utilizing the Malinâ€™s Intelligence Scale for Indian Children. Early childhood variables included growth stunting, maternal depression scores, home environment scores, and socio-economic status (SES) at 2 years of age. Statistical evaluation included bivariate analysis with further multi-variate regression for each resilience domain and the total resilience score. Findings: Out of 251 newborns recruited into the original birth cohort, 205 (81.7%) children were available for the 9-year follow-up. Mean (SD) scores in individual, caregiving, and context domains of resilience were 26.34 (3.2), 19.52 (1.6), and 20 (1.8) respectively. Individual resilience domain was associated with verbal cognition scores at 9 years of age (0.07, p = 0.019) and total home environment scores (0.16, p = 0.027) at 2 years of age, when adjusted for stunting, maternal depression, and SES. The total resilience score was associated only with concurrent verbal intelligence (0.08, p = 0.026) after adjustment with early childhood factors. Analysis of individual home environment factors showed that daily stimulation was associated with the individual domain of resilience. Conclusions: Follow-up of an Indian birth cohort showed that in addition to concurrent cognitive abilities, childhood resilience was related to early childhood stimulating home environment. Promoting optimal stimulating home environments in low-resource settings to nurture holistic childhood development including mental health is essential.
