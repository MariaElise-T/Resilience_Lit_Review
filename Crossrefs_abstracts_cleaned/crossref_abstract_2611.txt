This paper ascertained the perceived level of stress and coping strategies of trainers at Puerto Princesa School of Arts and Trades to minimize stress in the workplace. A quantitative method was used to find trainers’ sources of stress, perceived level of stress, coping strategies, and the relationship between the perceived level of stress and IPRC as an indicator of work performance. Data revealed that PPSAT trainers have similar or common stressors and perceived levels of stress. Their coping strategies differed in some aspects, showing uniqueness in dealing with different situations. More so, it was found that there is no significant relationship between the trainers’ perceived level of stress and work performance.  Keywords: stress, coping strategies, resiliency, work performance
