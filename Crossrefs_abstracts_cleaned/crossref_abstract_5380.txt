This article conceptualizes resilience, a capacity present in all people that can be activated to face and overcome adversity. Based on a systematic review of the literature, the different lines by which research on this subject has been developed to the present moment, when it is interpreted from neuroscience, are identified. From the first descriptions of risk and protective factors, the concept has moved through the consideration of resilience as a process that can be carried out by anyone and not as an intrinsic characteristic of exceptional people, to the study of the will to not let oneself be discouraged and the personal commitment to overcome. Next, the keys to promote this capacity in educational centers are analyzed. There are two main focuses of intervention: the relationship that the teacher can establish with students and the pedagogical strategies and resources that can be used. From the purpose of the integral formation of people and in an inclusive framework, educational centers have the challenge and responsibility to promote resilient processes in all students, especially in those who experience more barriers to learning and participation due to personal circumstances and adversities. In this way, educational centers are encouraged to be protective environments where all students feel safe and can empower themselves and unfold their potential. The review has been conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, and the bibliographic search has been performed in the Dialnet Plus, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases.
