Every year, natural disasters create havoc and threaten the strength & stability of communities throughout the world .The 2014 floods that struck Kashmir also created a lot of material and psychological devastation, by taking away many precious lives & destroying homes in its wake. Considering the same, the survivors of the floods were left not only with the challenges like unfinished repairs, lingering insurance claim disputes & financial strain but also the severe psychological problems like depression and trauma. Amidst such circumstances the depth of the psychological capital in the community has an important role to play. Broadly speaking, building resilience can be an effective response in this regard. As per Aldrich (2012) what contributes to efficient reconstruction is more important than ever. In this context the present study proposes a multi-step model of resilience development among flood affected people.
