Complicated cases in the treatment of totally edentulous patients, as well as in the fabrication of obturators and epitheses, require the use of resilient lining materials (RLMs). These materials have several disadvantages, which is why many dental practitioners do not recommend them. The tendency to breaking the bond between the hard acrylic resin and the resilient liner is a fact with unpleasant consequences, mainly found with the use of cold-curing silicone-based resilient liners. Methods to improve the bond between the hard denture base and the RLM have been the subject of numerous publications. The efforts of the authors are focused in two directions: mechanical or chemical treatment of the denture base or a combination of both. Other commonly discussed problems with the use of RLMs are the difficult and even impossible repair and the retention of oral fluids, fungi and other microorganisms due to the porosity of RLMs. Despite the wide variety of tools offered by different manufacturers, the issue of optimal and high-quality mechanical treatment of the polymerized resilient material has not yet been fully resolved.
