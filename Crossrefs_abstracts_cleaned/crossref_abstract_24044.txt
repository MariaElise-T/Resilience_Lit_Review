AbstractOne way that countries may differ in responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic is how they withstand extreme adversity while maintaining their societal values and institutions. This study explored national resilience in Israel, the Philippines, and Brazil during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using Crisis in Context Theory, cross‐national understanding of national resilience was examined by assessing measurement models, exploring country differences in perceptions, and determining its predictors. Data from an internationally diverse sample of 1,587 adults were collected using multiple measures and subsequently subjected to various analytical strategies. Results on the factor structure of NR‐13 demonstrated acceptable fit of both first‐order and higher‐order models for each country, with generally high factor loadings. However, measurement invariance was only supported at the configural level for the first‐order model. Among the three countries, national resilience was highest in Israel, followed by the Philippines, and lowest in Brazil. Taken collectively, both individual and ecological variables contributed a significant variance in national resilience in each country. Community resilience, quality of life, and perceived threats were consistently strong predictors of national resilience across countries. Results are discussed.
