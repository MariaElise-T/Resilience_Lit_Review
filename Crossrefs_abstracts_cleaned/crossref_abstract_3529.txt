The capacity of organizations of all types and sizes to face unexpected and unpredictable events is vital for survival and growth. Resilience is a desirable human characteristic. Individuals who can bounce back in stressful situations, setbacks, and failures in their lives are the ones with the characteristic of resilient. Resilient employees have a greater capacity to perform their job tasks and are better suited to adapt to adverse conditions. Knowing the effectiveness of organization-initiated support interventions in building resilience create opportunities to respond much better and emerge stronger in the world, which is volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. The COVID-19 pandemic was such an unexpected and unpredictable event, which tested the capacity of organizations and their employees. During the lockdown periods for the pandemic, organizations had to introduce several support interventions that supposed to help in getting the work done from employees, who were working from home. Although not necessarily targeted to enhance employee resilience, the present study argues that organization-initiated support interventions introduced to mitigate hindrances of the lockdown could have increased employee resilience. Accordingly, the present study investigated organization-initiated support interventions introduced during the state-regulated lockdown that could have increased employee resilience. The findings provide an assessment of organization-initiated support interventions and their effects in building employee resilience.
