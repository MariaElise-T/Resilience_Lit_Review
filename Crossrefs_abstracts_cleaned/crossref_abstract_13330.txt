 This study explores the integration of photovoice with Facebook to demonstrate diverse dimensions of vulnerability through the lens of twenty-six informal settlers in metropolitan Manila and Cebu City. Through this mixed-methods approach, the article adds to the growing literature on vulnerability as an intrinsic and dynamic outcome of unjust social structures in the context of community resilience. Findings demonstrate the richness of vulnerability through a participant-driven approach, enhancing plannersâ€™ understanding of current resilience studies. Such a nonlinear exploration also presents place-based concerns and capabilities, which potentially inform planners for more inclusive resilience building across scales.
