AbstractThe Resilient窶色riction Base Isolator (R窶色BI) is composed of a set of flat rings which can slide on each other with a central rubber core and/or peripheral rubber cores. In this base isolator the interfacial friction force acts in parallel with the elastic force in the rubber. It combines the beneficial effect of friction damping with that of the resiliency of rubber. The rubber cores distribute the sliding displacement and velocity along the height of the R窶色BI. They do not carry any vertical loads and are not vulcanized to the sliding rings.The system's analytical model and the computer experimental results for both horizontal and vertical components of recorded ground motions and various levels of friction and damping are presented. These results clearly demonstrate the R窶色BI's potential as an effective aseismic base isolator.
