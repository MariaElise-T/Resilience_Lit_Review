This article includes a perspective on cyber security through the lens of the World Economic Forum Resilience Framework. As cyber threats are a continual threat to organizations, it may be useful to consider resilience as a complementary approach to technological responses. The problem is that organizations cannot generate a sufficient number and types of responses to cyber security threats as the number of threats and associated costs continues to increase. The purpose of this article is to explore some possible practices and approaches to counter the ongoing and escalating cyber security threats, with the understanding and wisdom that not all threats will be possible to stop. Resilience is a complementary factor to directly countering threats by taking actions to backup information, having access to additional equipment as needed, by budgeting for failure, preparing for unexpected circumstances among other activities. Concepts from evolution and game theory are introduced within the resilience discussion.
