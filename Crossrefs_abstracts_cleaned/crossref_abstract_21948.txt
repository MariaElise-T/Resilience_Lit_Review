AbstractAffiliative tactile interactions buffer social mammals against neurobiological and behavioral effects of stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the cutaneous mechanisms underlying such beneficial consequences of touch by determining whether daily stroking, specifically targeted to activate a velocity/force tuned class of low‐threshold c‐fiber mechanoreceptor (CLTM), confers resilience against established markers of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 2 weeks of CMS. Throughout the CMS protocol, some rats were stroked daily, either at CLTM optimal velocity (5 cm/s) or outside the CLTM optimal range (30 cm/s). A third CMS exposed group did not receive any tactile stimulation. The effect of CMS on serum corticosterone levels, anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors in these three groups was assessed in comparison to a control group of non‐CMS exposed rats. While stroking did not mitigate the effects of CMS on body weight gain, CLTM optimal velocity stroking did significantly reduce CMS‐induced elevations in corticosterone following an acute forced‐swim. Rats receiving CLTM optimal stroking also showed significantly fewer anxiety‐like behaviors (elevated plus‐maze) than the other CMS exposed rats. In terms of depressive‐like behavior, whereas the same velocity‐specific resilience was observed in a forced‐swim test and social interaction test both groups of stroked rats spent significantly less time interacting than control rats, though they also spent significantly less time in the corner than non‐stroked CMS rats. Together, these findings support the theory CLTMs play a functional role in regulating the physiological condition of the body.
