 A research study conducted jointly by the Wyoming Department of Transportation and the University of Wyoming examined the effect of low emulsified base treatment on resilient modulus values. The study involved selecting two types of aggregate, treating duplicate samples with variable amounts of emulsified asphalt, and performing resilient modulus tests on the samples at various ages. Data were then analyzed to evaluate the variations in resilient modulus values due to the changes in testing time or percentage of emulsified asphalt added. The following conclusions were reached: resilient modulus testing can be used to evaluate emulsified asphaltâ€“treated bases; aging samples before testing will cause a substantial difference in resilient modulus values; and low percentages of emulsion treatments increase resilient modulus.
