AbstractCommunities affected by cumulative trauma can experience negative psychological reactions but also posttraumatic growth and community resilience, which promote adaptation and preparation for future traumatic events. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms that mediate the relationship between traumatic events and perceived community resilience. Participants were 118 Italian adults who experienced cumulative trauma and were recruited to complete an online survey. A serial multiple mediation model was estimated to assess whether the impact of the Morandi bridge collapse and posttraumatic growth mediated the relationship between the psychological impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic and perceived community resilience. The impact of the collapsed bridge and posttraumatic growth in serial partially mediated the relationship between the impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic and perceived community resilience. The impact of cumulative trauma can be considered through an ecological perspective that considers the consequences of these events in relation to community resilience.
