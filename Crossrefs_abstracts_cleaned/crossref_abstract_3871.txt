Introduction. Since the ethnopolitical/ethnocultural/ethnonational sphere contains internal confl ictive potential (internal threats) that can be used externally by other states (external threats), there is a high need to develop a concept of ethnonational resilience, which is the main aim of this study. 
For the first time, the concept of ethnonational resilience, its place and role in the system of national stability of Ukraine was scientifi cally studied. Substantiations of the concept of ethnonational resilience is off ered, as well author’s defi nition of ethnonational resilience as ability of ethnopolitical system (state in interaction with polyethnic society) to support development by means of normative-legal and institutional formation of system and strategy of providing: 1) anticipation, detection and prevention of internal and external ethnic character’ threats; 2) incorporation of such threats, their transformation into an additional resource/impetus for the development of the whole ethnopolitical system.
Conclusions. Only the adequate to the realities of ethnonational development and now a day ethnopolitical challenges, the model of ethnonational policy, based on a strong legislative and institutional framework, can ensure the formation of ethnonational resilience and prevent the realization of most hybrid threats in internal and external security environments.
Since 2014, ethnonational resilience has been formed as an integral feature of the ethnopolitical system of Ukraine, which consists not only in anticipating, identifying, preventing and counteracting hybrid threats, but also in turning them into an internal resource/impetus for further development that mobilizes all components of the system to achieve the goal of preserving/restoring territorial integrity and preserving the civilizational subjectivity of Ukraine.

Key words: ethnonational resilience, system of national resilience, ethnopolitical safety, ethnopolitical system.
