Significance
Thirty to fifty percent of depressed individuals are unresponsive to commonly prescribed antidepressant treatments, suggesting that biological mechanisms, such as stress-induced inflammation and blood vessel dysfunction, remain untreated. The bloodâ€“brain barrier is the ultimate frontier between the brain and harmful toxins or inflammatory signals circulating in the blood. Depression and vulnerability to chronic social stress are associated with loss of this barrier integrity; however, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Identification of adaptations leading to resilience under stressful conditions could help develop novel treatments. Here we combined behavioral, pharmacological, and cell-specific gene profiling experiments in mice with epigenetic, molecular, and anatomical analysis of human samples to unravel mechanisms with therapeutic potential to protect the brain and promote resilience.
