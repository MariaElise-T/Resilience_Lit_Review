Abstract

Background
There is a need for effective primary care interventions that help older people combat frailty and build resilience.


Objective
To study the effectiveness of an optimised exercise and dietary protein intervention.


Design
Multicentre, randomised-controlled, parallel-arm trial.


Setting
Six primary care practices, Ireland.


Methods
Six general practitioners enrolled adults aged 65+ with Clinical Frailty Scale score ≤5 from December 2020 to May 2021. Participants were randomised to intervention or usual care with allocation concealed until enrolment. Intervention comprised a 3-month home-based exercise regime, emphasising strength, and dietary protein guidance (1.2 g/kg/day). Effectiveness was measured by comparing frailty levels, based on the SHARE-Frailty Instrument, on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes included bone mass, muscle mass and biological age measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Ease of intervention and perceived health benefit were measured on Likert scales.


Results
Of the 359 adults screened, 197 were eligible and 168 enrolled; 156 (92.9%) attended follow-up (mean age 77.1; 67.3% women; 79 intervention, 77 control). At baseline, 17.7% of intervention and 16.9% of control participants were frail by SHARE-FI. At follow-up, 6.3 and 18.2% were frail, respectively. The odds ratio of being frail between intervention and control groups post-intervention was 0.23 (95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.72; P = 0.011), adjusting for age, gender and site. Absolute risk reduction was 11.9% (CI: 0.8%–22.9%). Number needed to treat was 8.4. Grip strength (P &lt; 0.001) and bone mass (P = 0.040) improved significantly. 66.2% found the intervention easy, 69.0% reported feeling better.


Conclusion
A combination of exercises and dietary protein significantly reduced frailty and improved self-reported health.
