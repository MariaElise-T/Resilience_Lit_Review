The coronavirus outbreak in early 2020 caused havoc on those directly afflicted, giving a chance to investigate the role of a variety of variables (protective behaviours) in resilience for individuals who were indirectly exposed. In an Internet convenience sample of 615 people, indices of assessed resilience were linked to mental relaxation strategies, involvement in household chores, confidence in survival, change in sleeping habits, and personal attribution during India's first countrywide lockdown. At the same time, perceived resilience was linked to survival and educational confidence. These findings emphasize the importance of education, survival thinking, family cohesiveness, and personal habits in helping people become stronger, more durable, and resilient people.
