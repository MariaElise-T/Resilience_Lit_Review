AbstractObjectiveAn adapted, time‐limited dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills training group therapy can prove to be an evidence‐based treatment that can easily fit the needs, demands, and limitations of University Counseling Centers to serve college students with mental disorders. The present naturalistic study investigated the effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability of a 4‐week DBT‐informed group therapy in enhancing psychological resilience.MethodsParticipants included 59 college students with heterogeneous mental health concerns. They attended weekly 1.5‐hr DBT‐informed, resilience‐building group therapy for 4 weeks. Psychological resilience, mindfulness, emotional dysregulation, and overall distress were assessed at pretreatment and posttreatment, as well as at 1‐ and 3‐month follow‐ups.ResultsFindings showed increased psychological resilience among the participants at posttreatment and follow‐ups, and provided preliminary evidence for the role of mindfulness as an important contributor to enhancing psychological resilience even after controlling for risk factors, treatment dosage, pregroup psychological resilience, and changes in emotion dysregulation and overall distress.ConclusionA 4‐week DBT‐informed skills training group therapy can be utilized as a time‐efficient, cost‐effective, well‐accepted preventative treatment with the potential longitudinal impact to boost psychological resilience for college students with mental health issues.
