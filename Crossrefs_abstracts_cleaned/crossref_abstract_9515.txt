AbstractObjectiveTo assess relationships between resilience, frailty and outcomes in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients.MethodsEighty‐nine inpatients had Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and frailty index (FI‐CGA) completed. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was used to determine correlation between BRS, FI‐CGA and covariates. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine associations between resilience, frailty and covariates with functional independence measure gain, length of stay (LOS) > 21 days, mortality and discharge care requirements.ResultsThere was a negative correlation between BRS and premorbid FI‐CGA (r = −0.31, P = 0.03) and admission FI‐CGA (r = −0.26, P = 0.01) and between BRS and Mini‐Mental State Examination score (rho = −0.26, P = 0.02). BRS was not associated with observed outcomes. Premorbid FI‐CGA was associated with inpatient mortality, and greater increase in FI‐CGA during acute stay was associated with greater LOS. All patients who died were frail (FI‐CGA > 0.25).ConclusionResilience and frailty were inversely related. Frailty was an independent predictor of rehabilitation LOS and mortality.
