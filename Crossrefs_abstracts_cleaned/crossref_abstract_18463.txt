AbstractAimThis study aimed to understand the lived experience of rural mothers caring for a child with a chronic health condition and to understand their perspectives on the support, services and resources they identify as necessary to effectively manage caregiving.BackgroundMaternal caregivers in rural areas experience difficulty accessing specialist health care for their child and can also experience geographical and social isolation. Understanding the factors that enable these maternal caregivers to overcome the challenges and adversities faced is crucial to help nurses identify and facilitate avenues for support and resources.DesignThis study employed a phenomenological design. The study is reported in line with Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research guidelines (COREQ).MethodsSemi‐structured interviews were conducted with 17 maternal caregivers in rural New South Wales, Australia, who had at least one child with a chronic health condition aged between 2–18 years. Data were collected from March to June 2018. Thematic analysis was used to develop a thematic framework. This paper reports on one of the major themes identified in this research, specifically maternal resilience.ResultsParticipants demonstrated maternal resilience by creating meaningful social connections, cultivating networks, developing problem‐solving skills, enhancing their self‐efficacy and finding a sense of purpose through hope and optimism. These strategies provide nurses insight into how some rural women overcome adversities associated with their maternal labour required in caring for a child with a chronic health condition.ConclusionThis study found that participants overcame the challenges related to their caregiving work, emerging as resilient caregivers. Understanding maternal resilience assists nurses to provide the services rural mothers in Australia need to care for their child with a CHC.Relevance to clinical practiceFindings from this study provide insight into the experiences of rural maternal caregivers of children with a chronic health condition and identify the strategies they adopt to overcome caregiver challenges. Understanding these strategies allows nurses to improve care and support for rural mothers using a strength‐based approach to build maternal resilience.
