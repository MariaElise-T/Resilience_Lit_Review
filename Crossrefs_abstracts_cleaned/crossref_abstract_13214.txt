The researchers utilized a participatory approach based on expert opinion, which was used to assess the environmental, social, economic, and visual value and accessibility benefits of the Güzelcehisar Beach Boardwalk (GBB) application in the province of Bartın in Turkey’s Western Black Sea Region. The questionnaire was administered face-to-face and online to 120 professionals from various subject area fields. According to field specialists, the benefits of the GBB are as follows: social benefit, visual value and accessibility, economic benefit, and environmental benefit. The GBB was evaluated as an example of infrastructure within the scope of effective solutions for tourism and recreation activities and resilience within sustainable development of rural coastal landscapes using a participatory approach, so the results will guide Integrated Coastal Zone Management planning for the area.
