In order to operate the Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) in the real world, the system needs to be structured to have people in the real world incorporated as a part of its process: Human-in-the-Loop CPS (HITLCPS). With people in the real world incorporated as a part of its process, the system must have a secure structure to be able to continue operating normally. With sensors, actuators and other devices connected in a network, it becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks; hence, its framework must be resilient and secure in order to ensure its safety in the face of any disturbances. In this paper, we describe a safety-based secure system structure, using a STAMP model and a covariance structure.
