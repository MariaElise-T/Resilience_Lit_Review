This paper describes the collaborative application of three theoretical models for supporting service planning (Hunter, 2006), programme planning (Chorpita et al, 2005a), and implementation (Meyers et al, 2012) to develop and implement a Resilience Practice Framework (RPF). Specifically, we (1) describe a theory of change framework (Hunter, 2006) to clarify the target for intervention and outcomes to be achieved; (2) describe a common elements approach (Chorpita et al, 2005a) to select evidence-informed practices; (3) describe the application of the Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) (Meyers et al, 2012) to implement an RPF; and lastly (4) present preliminary findings for early implementation efforts and future directions.
