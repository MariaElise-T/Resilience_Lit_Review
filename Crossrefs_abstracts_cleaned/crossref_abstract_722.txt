Resilience has been recognized as an important concept, especially for nurses who face many risk factors in their professional lives, provide professional care to patients with difficulties and needs in all circumstances, and have to comfort the patients. Prevention efforts and support and skill development interventions to improve the well-being and coping skills of nurses lead to sustainable changes for nurses. For this reason, this study aims to develop a resilience program for nurses, examine the effect of the program on nurses’ resilience, and report the related process. In the study, a randomized controlled experimental design was created to determine the resilience levels of nurses. The study sample consisted of nurses who met the inclusion criteria of the study. The G*power 3.1 program was used to determine the number of nurses in the experimental and control groups and the minimum sample size was calculated as 58. However, the sample size was defined as 72 (36 in the experimental, 36 in the control group) considering the possibility of dropouts (the number of those who did not continue the study) during the research period. In the study, measurements were made three times (pre-test, repeated post-test, and 3rd-month follow-up test). Within the scope of the study, a “Personal Information Form” and the “Resilience Scale for Adults” was applied to the nurses. After data collection and analysis, the findings were explained. The effectiveness of the positive psychotherapy-based resilience program on the resilience of nurses was evaluated.
