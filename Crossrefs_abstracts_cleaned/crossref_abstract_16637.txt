 This manuscript describes the development of the Suicide Resilience Inventoryâ€“25, used to assess factors that help defend against suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We used multiple sources to generate and evaluate initial items (Study 1), then conducted an iterated principal-axis factor analysis with data from a combined sample of 540 adolescents and young adults. This identified three correlated factors, named Internal Protective, Emotional Stability, and External Protective. Estimated alpha for the total inventory and scales was high (.90 to .95). In Study 1, scores on the inventory significantly differentiated between the responses of adolescents and young adults. In Study 2, the inventory scores significantly differentiated between participants who reported (a) no prior suicide thoughts or attempts (145 men and 153 women), (b) brief suicidal thoughts (55 men and 110 women), and (c) prior suicide plans or attempts (22 men and 55 women). Results of the two studies suggest the inventory is useful for assessing the construct of suicide resilience in terms of these three operationally defined dimensions.
