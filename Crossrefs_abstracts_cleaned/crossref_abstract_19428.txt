Many LGBTQ+ people face significant physical and mental health, social, and economic disparities, disparities that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent qualitative and quantitative research has explored some of the specific ways that LGBTQ+ people have been developing and using resilience strategies during the pandemic, but little is currently known regarding specific pandemic-related stressors unique to LGBTQ+ individuals, social support networks and community resilience developed by LGBTQ+ individuals, and accessibility of both LGBTQ+-specific and general health care needs. The present study was conducted to help address these gaps in the current research literature. As part of a larger online survey on LGBTQ+ people and the impacts of COVID-19, participants (N= 220) were asked a series of open-ended questions about their general and identity-specific concerns, forms of coping, and forms of social support accessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the consensual qualitative research modified method (CQR-M), 31 subdomains grouped under seven main domains were revealed: (1)societal orientation; (2)personal worries; (3)personal maintenance and planning; (4)concerns for close others; (5)source of connection; (6)connection format; and (7)LGBTQ+ affirmative care. The findings in the present study expand research and health provider understanding of unique forms of distress, coping, social support, and community resilience experienced and engaged in by LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These qualitative findings can help inform more targeted interventions at individual, community, and public policy levels.
