This research aimed to systematically review the development studies pertaining to forest biomass and bioenergy supply chain resilience (SCR). In this regard, a mixed procedure was implemented in order to explore and analyze the relevant publications, and to answer the research questions. First, the databases and journals working on forest biomass and bioenergy supply chains (SCs) were identified based on the indices of the review process and the indices of the barriers and enablers. Next, data refinement was employed to filter the publications into four levels and determine the semifinal cases. Moreover, the references of the semifinal publications were tracked in order to achieve the final cases. Consequently, 88 papers were determined as the final cases through which the barriers and enablers were explored and analyzed. Furthermore, in order to meet the research gap in this area and prove the connections of those barriers and enablers with the resilience capability, their relationships with the main resilience factors were investigated. According to the assessment, the findings of this research on the definition, barriers and enablers of forest biomass and bioenergy SCR can be applied as a basis for the comprehension and optimization of the structure of SCs in the forest biomass and bioenergy industries.
