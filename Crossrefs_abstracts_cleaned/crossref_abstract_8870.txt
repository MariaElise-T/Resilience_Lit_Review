In order to meet the design requirement of maintainability in equipment’s battlefield guarantee process, substance-field analysis model based on the TRIZ theory is introduced in this paper. It can improve system’s maintainability design efficiency to predict the evolution direction of technical system and analysis the ideal solution by the model. Taking the design of combat resilience of radar feed transmission system as an example, this paper analyzed the application of substance-field model in equipment’s combat resilience design. The result shows that TRIZ substance-field analysis model can effectively guide the combat resilience design, specify the design direction, and improve the design efficiency.
