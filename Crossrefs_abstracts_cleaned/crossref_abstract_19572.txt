The goal of the article is to examine the relationship between supply chain risk, Supply chain integration, Supply chain risk resilience and Firm performance in the global supply chain of the Vietnamese pharmaceutical industry. Data was collected for 3 months with 389 satisfied pharmaceutical enterprises for analysis on Smart PLS software. The results show that Supply chain risk has a statistically significant negative impact on supply chain integration. Moreover, Supply chain Integration has a statistically significant positive impact on Supply chain risk Resilience and firm performance. Finally, we find that Firm performance is a good foundation for business operations and supply chain risk resilience. Therefore, we make recommendations to Vietnamese pharmaceutical enterprises that: Supply chain Integration is extremely necessary to ensure performance and Supply chain risk resilience in the context of the current covid-19 pandemic.
