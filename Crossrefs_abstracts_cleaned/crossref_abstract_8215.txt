 Successful adaptation among immigrant youths is a highly important issue for multiple stakeholders in many countries because of its potential long-term significance for the well-being of migrants and the prosperity and social cohesion of the receiving societies. In this article, I examine immigrant-youth adaptation through the lens of a recently developed resilience model. What are the risks that threaten immigrant youths’ adaptation? What are the promotive or protective influences that support their positive adaptation? These questions are addressed using scientific evidence drawn from the Athena Studies of Resilient Adaptation project, a two-cohort, three-wave longitudinal project on immigrant-youth adaptation conducted in Greece, as well as from the international literature. Risks and resources for immigrant youths’ concurrent and long-term adaptation are examined in societal, developmental, and acculturative contexts. The integrative model and related scientific findings may inform public policy, as well as guide future research.
