Inspired by the opportunities provided by the Industry 4.0 technologies for smarter, risk‐informed, safer, and resilient operation, control, and management of the lifeline critical networks, this study investigates mobility‐as‐a‐service for resilience delivery during natural disasters. Focusing on effective service restoration in power distribution systems, we introduce mobile power sources (MPSs) as the restoration technology of the future, the mobility of which can be harnessed for spatiotemporal flexibility exchange and effective response and recovery during disasters. We present automated decision‐making solutions that coordinate the MPSs utilization with repair crew (RC) schedules taking into account constraints in both energy and transportation networks. When integrated, the suggested technology aided by the proposed optimization models will have the potential to disrupt the current practice in boosting the resilience and operational endurance of the mission‐critical systems and services during disasters, ultimately resulting in an enriched social welfare and national security.
