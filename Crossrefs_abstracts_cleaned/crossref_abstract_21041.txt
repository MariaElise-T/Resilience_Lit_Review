AbstractThe study assessed the mediating role of green organizational capabilities (green technology development, green operations, and green transactions), in the relationship between green value co‐creation and organizational resilience among Chinese manufacturing firms, that is, firms' ability to build strong organizational resilience in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. It focused on manufacturing firms operating within Shenzhen, a coastal city located within the Guangdong province in southeastern China. The sample comprised 234 firms. Data were analysed using a covariance‐based structural equation modeling. Findings revealed that green value co‐creation had no direct effect on organizational resilience, rather, its effect was realized indirectly through green organizational capabilities. The study concludes that manufacturing companies can augment their organizational capabilities by leveraging the knowledge of their customers through green value co‐creation to build strong organizational resilience. Theoretical and managerial implications have been provided.
