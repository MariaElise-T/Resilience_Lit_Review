Recently, climate change has caused serious natural disasters at the vulnerable areas with many mountainous regions. This study analyzes the behavior of debris flow with respect to time elapse by applying various precipitation, mountain slope change, and the categories of vegetation loosened in mountainous areas. The behavior of debris flow is debris flow discharge and water depth. In addition, the runout length of debris flow passed through the channel and reached the downstream according to the change of the water supply and slope was measured. The larger the supply flow, the higher the debris flow discharge, and the second peak value became faster as the supply flow increased, and the slope became steeper. In the category where the multiplier of vegetation for debris flow is large, the fluctuation period was made long, and the amplitude of the fluctuation was also made large. As for the debris flow runout length, the supply flow was large and it was spread in a considerable range on steep slopes. This study will provide various information such as establishing measures for debris flow occurring in vulnerable areas to natural disasters due to climate change, or establishing a plan for strengthening resilience.
