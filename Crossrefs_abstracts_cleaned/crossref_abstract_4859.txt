Mental Health is a determinant of reproductive mortality and morbidity especially in the developing regions of the world with reproductive health problems. The right to sexual and reproductive health has been enunciated by the United Nations as a goal to be achieved by 2030. However, indigenous women are the most vulnerable population because of the conditions that surround them. A cross-sectional quantitative study was done in the indigenous communities of Mexico to know the resilience and reproductive health diagnosis. A Mexican Resilience Scale, gynaeco-obstetrical clinical history and a reproductive health survey were applied. A total of 180 women participated from which 34.6% and 61.4% of the women used a form of birth control method in their first and last sexual intercourse, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the three attitudes among reproductive health and the highest levels of resilience (p<0.05). Resilience was seen to have a positive influence on the attitude of indigenous women, reducing the vulnerability among reproductive health.
