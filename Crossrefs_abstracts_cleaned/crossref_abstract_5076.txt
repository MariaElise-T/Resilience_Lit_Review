Among the three online landslide databases introduced here, we focus on Japanâ€™s large-scale online landslide topography distribution mapping as a gratis Software as a Service (SaaS) application that has proven effective in hazard mapping because many large new landslides have recurred at old landslide sites. Google Earth is an effective SaaS hazardmapping tool for extracting local community landslide microtopography. Combining these maps and handwritten landslide site drawings provides economical, reliable hazard maps for community residents in developing and developed countries. Author proposed a possibility of undergraduate students volunteer acitivties for promoting hazard mapping. The early warning system based on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and the Japanese soil-water index (SWI) may contribute to making society more resilient against landslide disasters.
