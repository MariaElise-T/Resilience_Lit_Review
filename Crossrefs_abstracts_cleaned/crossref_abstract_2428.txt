This article explores the role resilience processes play in education and well-being outcomes for street-connected children. It draws on research and practice undertaken as part of the Building with Bamboo Programme (BwB) on resilience. BwB investigated the forms a resilience-based approach might usefully take in practice, the effect this has on promoting resilience in children, and how this resilience leads to improved outcomes in their lives. Our article draws specifically on the experiences of street-connected children who were involved in such approaches as part of programmes at S.A.L.V.E. International, Uganda between 2016 and 2018. Drawing on individual street-connected childrenâ€™s resilience pathways through BwB and beyond, the article unpacks the connections between resilience processes and improved educational and well-being outcomes. It outlines how programme activities were developed and nurtured through cycles of learning and innovation to continually evolve existing strength-based programme practice with street-connected children whilst extending this work into the wider systems around children including peer networks, organisations, families and communities.
