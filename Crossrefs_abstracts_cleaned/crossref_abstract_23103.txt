Menopausal transition (MT) is a natural process in women from reproductive decline to aging. During this period, women present with an increased prevalence of psychological distress. The aim of this study was to investigate how resilience and family support interact to influence psychological distress among women during MT. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 858 women during MT from Shandong Province. All participants completed the 10-item Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale, the family care degree questionnaire, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 24.0. Response surface analysis was used for polynomial regression and response surface analysis. The results of response surface analysis show that in the case of agreement between resilience and family support, the joint effect manifested as a negative curve (inverted U shape) related to the psychological distress of women during MT. In the case of disagreement, the joint effect manifested as a negative curve (inverted U shaped) related to psychological distress. Specifically, with increased variance in the degree of resilience and family support, women experienced less psychological distress. Both resilience and family support play an important role in protecting women from psychological distress, either alone or in combination. Future intervention studies targeting women during MT should consider the coordinated actions of resilience and family support.
