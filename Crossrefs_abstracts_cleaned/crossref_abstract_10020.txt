Abstract
In this work, we investigate and compare propagation of Laguerreâ€“Gaussian (LG) and the recently introduced radial carpet (RC) beams through an indoor convective air turbulence under weak to strong turbulence conditions. By determining the radial displacement of the intensity maxima over the donut ring of the LG beam, and tracing the radial coordinates of the main intensity spots of the RC beam, when the beams are propagating through the turbulence, we estimate the variance of the local displacements for both of the beams in the radial direction. It is shown that, under the same turbulence conditions, the RC beam experiences less disturbance and is more resilient to turbulence, especially when it has a complicated structure. The measured values of the image displacement variance for the RC beam are almost one order of magnitude smaller than the same parameter for the LG beam. In addition, for the LG beam, the symmetry of the beam is broken and in many places the intensity ring is even cut off. Although there are slight changes in the RC beams transverse intensity distribution, the number of the main intensity spots rarely changes. This feature makes the RC beam a good candidate for the transmission of information. We also show that a set of RC beams having different values of the main intensity spots (generated with different radial gratings having different spoke numbers) can be used as an orthogonal bases for free-space optical communication.
