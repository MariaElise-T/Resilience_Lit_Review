Lessons learned from the crisis in Indonesia prove that the concept of community resilience, together with community-based development, significantly affects the ability to fight against the crisis at the local and community levels.  In addition to improving urban livability, today’s urban development in Indonesia must also struggle to overcome various pressures due to natural disasters. Community resilience is considered a bottom-up solution to address these problems. This study aims to see how community resilience affects settlements’ livability in Malang City, one of Indonesia’s medium-sized cities. This research also analyses the relationship between resilience and livability variables to formulate prescriptive development strategies. The research used quantitative analysis by compiling and selecting data from secondary and primary sources to formulate indicators  and variables of the proposed model. Descriptive analysis and structural equation modelling were conducted using SEM-PLS. The model built from this research shows that community resilience is the main factor that shapes livability in Malang City, indicated by social life, urban environment, and economy. Important variables forming community resilience are population vulnerability, physical infrastructure, and environmental infrastructure.
