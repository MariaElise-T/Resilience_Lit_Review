Psychosocial and mental health supports for war-affected children frequently are limited by a deficits focus. Current research and practice indicate the value of a strengths-based approach that supports children's resilience and supports a positive environment for children and builds on existing strengths. This paper analyzes how community-based child protection mechanisms are a cornerstone of prevention efforts, and views community-based action as a particularly valuable source for strengths-based support for war-affected children. It shows how collective planning and action on behalf of vulnerable children create high levels of community ownership and effective, sustainable supports for children. It suggests that significant work lies ahead in strengthening the evidence base regarding the effectiveness of strengths-based approaches and in transforming practice away from expert-driven approaches toward community-driven action.
