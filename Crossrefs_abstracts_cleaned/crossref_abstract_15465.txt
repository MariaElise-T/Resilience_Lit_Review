In today's rapidly changing economic landscape, financial resilience has become increasingly important especially for public sector organizations. This study investigates the impact of e-government adoption and social support on individuals' financial resilience in Indonesia, with a focus on the mediating role of financial management skills. A quantitative research methodology was employed, and 348 complete and suitable questionnaires from individuals in the financial department in local government in Indonesia were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 software. The results indicate a significant relationship between e-government adoption and financial management skills, suggesting that digitizing government services contributes to improved financial resilience. Additionally, social support was found to have a positive impact on financial management skills, supporting the notion that social networks provide resources and support for financial well-being. Financial management skills were also found to be significantly associated with financial resilience, indicating that individuals with strong financial management skills are better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. While the mediating effect of financial management skills between e-government adoption and financial resilience was not significant, it was significant in the relationship between social support and financial resilience. These findings provide insights into the factors that enhance financial resilience in an increasingly digitized society and inform strategies to promote financial well-being in Indonesia.
