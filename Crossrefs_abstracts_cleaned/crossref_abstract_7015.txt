 This paper discusses the resilience factors of industrial sectors under lifeline (electricity, water, and gas) system disruptions. The resilience factor is one of the quantitative measurements of lifeline impacts, which focuses on the production output of some industrial sectors during lifeline disruptions. Recent studies have provided the detailed structure of business resilience that includes multiple resilience options, such as production rescheduling, inventories, and back-up generators. However, the impacts of these options on resilience factor are not thoroughly investigated due to the lack of data. In addition, resilience factor in previous study is assumed to be applied only to the single-lifeline disruption case, which is a limited case in large-scale disasters. In this study, the resilience factors for 27 industrial sectors are estimated based on the empirical surveys conducted in the Aichi and Shizuoka Prefectures, Japan, focusing on more rigorous characteristics of resilience. One particular contribution of this paper is introducing the resilience factor that considers individual and compound effects of available resilience options along with multiple lifeline disruptions.
