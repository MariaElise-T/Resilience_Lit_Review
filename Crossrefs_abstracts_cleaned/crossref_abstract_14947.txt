 Retaining workers in high stress occupations and preparing undergraduates to enter these occupations continues to intensify along with mental health and wellbeing challenges. The veterinary profession is particularly vulnerable to poor psychological health which contributes negatively to the retention of veterinarians in the profession. Employing the positive psychology theoretical model rationale, and the andragogy philosophies and approaches, a veterinary career development (VCD) program was scaffolded across a five year Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc) degree. Thematic analysis of participants’ feedback with a focus on what they think, feel and do provided valuable insights into participants’ developing skill-strength and tacit knowledge, and their resilience-building. The authors believe this is the first report on the creation and outcomes of a veterinary career development program that fosters the building of resilience through the attainment of tacit knowledge and practical skills required for successful employment and wellbeing.
