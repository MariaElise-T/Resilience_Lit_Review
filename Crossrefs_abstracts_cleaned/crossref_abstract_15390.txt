Today, with the gradual improvement of material living standards, basketball is becoming more and more popular, and the pursuit of sports protection and shoes performance is also getting higher and higher. A good pair of basketball shoe soles can help athletes solve these problems. This article is aimed at studying the preparation of basketball shoe soles made of high resilience and nonslip composite materials. Under this research topic, this paper proposes a method for the design of shoe sole antislip pattern and the measurement method of composite materialâ€™s resilience performance and a 3D printing method based on FDM technology to print the shoe sole. At the same time, an experiment was designed to explore the high resilience and antislip performance of the sole. And the stability of printing technology is analyzed to ensure the quality of sneaker printing. The experimental results in this article show that the antislip performance of the sole printed by the above method design has been improved by 31%, and the rebound capacity has been improved by 44%. At the same time, the rebound time is significantly shorter than that of several common basketball shoes on the market.
