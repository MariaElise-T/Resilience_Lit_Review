Aim: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of reality-based and emotionally focused couple therapy (EFCT) interventions on the happiness and resilience of couples.
Methods: The method of the present study was a single case experimental design of multiple simultaneous baselines. The statistical population of the study were maladapted couples referred to Talieh Mehr Couple Therapy Center in Tehran (149 couples), in which 6 couples were selected as a sample by purposive and voluntary sampling method. Then, the approaches were performed in pairs for reality therapy and EFT for each couple with a two-month follow-up. The standard Oxford happiness (Argyle, Martin, Crossland, 1989) and Conor-Davidson resilience (Conor-Davidson, 2003) questionnaires were completed as data collection tools. Data were analyzed by visual mapping, stable change index, and recovery percentage formula.
Results: The results showed that reality therapy-based couple therapy increased the happiness and resilience of couples (61.06% and 49.31% recovery, respectively) and its effect was maintained until the end of the two-month follow-up period (60.05% and 51.88% recovery). Also, EFCT increased the happiness and resilience of couples, respectively (28.06% and 28.87% recovery) and its effect was maintained until the end of the two-month follow-up period (26.81% and 29.73%, recovery). The index of their change in reliability also indicated that these changes were significant (p <0.05).
Conclusion: The results showed the effectiveness of couple therapy interventions based on reality therapy and EFT on increasing the happiness and resilience of incompatible couples and the mentioned approaches can explain the desirable degree of variability of happiness and resilience of incompatible couples.
