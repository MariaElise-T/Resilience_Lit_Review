In recent decades, low-yielding seismic devices based on the use of friction dampers have emerged as an excellent solution for the development of building structures with improved reparability and resilience. Achieving an optimal design for such low-yielding seismic devices requires precise control of bolt preloading levels and predictability of the friction coefficient (CoF) between the damper interfaces. While various types of friction devices exist that are capable of providing significant energy dissipation, ongoing research is focused on the development of novel friction materials that exhibit a stable hysteretic response, high CoF values, minimal differences between static and dynamic CoF, and predictable slip resistance. In this context, an experimental campaign was conducted at the STRENGTH Laboratory of the University of Salerno to evaluate the behaviour of new friction shims employing specially developed metal alloys. Specifically, the influence of the characteristics of the contact surfaces in the sliding area on the behaviour and performance of the friction device was analysed. The tests followed the loading protocol recommended by EN12159 for seismic device qualification. Monitored parameters included preloading force values and the evolution of slip resistance. The friction value was determined, along with its degradation over time. Finally, the materialâ€™s performance in terms of hysteretic behaviour was assessed, providing a comparison of the tested specimens in terms of slip force degradation and energy dissipation capacity.
