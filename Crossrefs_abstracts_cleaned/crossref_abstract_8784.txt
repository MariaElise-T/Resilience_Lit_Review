Introduction:Hospitals are fundamental infrastructure, and when well-designed can provide a trusted place of refuge and a central point for health and wellbeing services in the aftermath of disasters. The ability of hospitals to continue functioning is dependent on location, the resilience of buildings, critical systems, equipment, supplies, and resources as well as people. Working towards ensuring that the local hospital is resilient is essential in any disaster management system and the level of hospital resilience can be used as an indicator in measuring community resilience. The most popular measure of hospital resilience is the World Health Organisation’s Hospital Safety Index (HSI) used in over 100 countries to assess and guide improvements to achieve structurally and functionally disaster resilient hospitals. Its purpose is to promote safe hospitals where services “remain accessible and functioning at maximum capacity, and with the same infrastructure, before, during and immediately after the impact of emergencies and disasters.” It identifies likely high impact hazards, vulnerabilities, and mitigation/improvement actions.Aim:The HSI can be a valuable tool as part of the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. However, to date, it has been used infrequently in developed countries. This project pilots the application of the HSI across seven facilities in a North Queensland health service (an area prone to cyclones and flooding), centered on a tertiary referral center, each providing 24-hour emergency health services.Results:Key indicators of resilience and the result of the audit will be discussed within geographical and cultural contexts, including the benefits of the HSI in augmenting existing hospital assessment and accreditation processes to identify vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.Discussion:The research outcomes are to be used by the health service to improve infrastructure and provide anticipated community benefits, especially through the continuation of health services post disasters.
