The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) rely heavily on the participation of the public sector as a major player in its successful implementation. A sound public administrative system is a standalone goal for sustainable SDG-16 that seeks to develop effective, responsible, and inclusive institutions at all levels for the development of mankind. However, the prevalent perception of public sector organizations is that they are overly large, inefficient, wasteful, untruthful, and lack transparency. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the pillar(s) of organizational sustainability and antecedents of organizational resilience that are frequently studied, highlighting current problems. This study analyzed 53 articles (published between 2008 and 2022) on organizational resilience in relation to sustainability. We review studies published in international journals. The findings show that organizational resilience and sustainability research has advanced significantly during this time and is still a promising field for scholarly investigation. The SLR reveals that most studies were conducted in developed nations, followed by some Asian countries, and there are adequate studies in the private sector, while the public sector has received limited attention from the research community and practitioners. This research gap is presented and discussed.
