Objective:Many of those who experience the trauma and abuse of sex trafficking also struggle with a variety of physical and mental health issues, a major one of those issues being posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, we explored the relationship between verbal comprehension and a PTSD diagnosis to see if this aspect of intelligence might be stronger for individuals without a diagnosis of PTSD.Participants and Methods:Participants included 22 adolescent girls between the ages of 14 and 18 who had experienced sex trafficking. Participants were referred to Fuller Psychological and Family Services for learning difficulties, where they were given comprehensive clinical neuropsychological evaluations, including a Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC or WAIS) and a screening for PTSD. WISC or WAIS Full Scale IQ ranged from 75 to 115 (M = 85.1, SD = 11.2).Results:Contrary to the hypothesis that those without PTSD would have higher verbal comprehension scores than those with PTSD, the results indicated no difference between the two groups, t(23) = -.86 , p = .40. However, verbal comprehension scores across both groups were significantly below the normal range, suggesting a relationship between trauma and verbal comprehension.Conclusions:The diagnosis of PTSD may impact intelligence in ways not anticipated for this population, or perhaps our method of diagnosing PTSD did not adequately nuance the varying responses to trauma. By further exploring the relationships between Verbal Comprehension Indexes and markers of resilience, we may be able to better understand the characteristics of resilience demonstrated by those who become involved in prostitution.
