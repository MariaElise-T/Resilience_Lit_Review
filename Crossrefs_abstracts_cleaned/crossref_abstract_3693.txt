Abstract
The world’s population is aging while the Earth’s climate is warming. The climate change crisis poses threats to our aging population and requires concerted action. Steps to address these threats present opportunities for improving livability for people of all ages while addressing the underlying drivers of climate change. Yet prominent action frameworks such as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities do not explicitly include climate resilience and sustainability as essential elements of age-friendly communities. In this essay, we argue for the creation of a cross-cutting and interdependent sustainability and climate resilience domain to complement the existing interconnected WHO age-friendly domains of community and healthcare, communication and information, housing, civic participation and employment, outdoor spaces and buildings, social participation, respect and social inclusion, and transportation. These domains drive the community engagement, planning, action, and evaluation required by the communities who join the Global Network for Age-Friendly Cities and Communities. The age-friendly network currently includes 1,445 communities, across 51 countries. We discuss how the alignment of age-friendly and climate resilience networks strengthens local action and global advocacy through a shared vision for an age-friendly and climate resilient future.
