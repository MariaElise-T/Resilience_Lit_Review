Over the years, population growth resulted from urban sprawl in meeting the needs and demands of the future generation globally and locally.Â  Consequently, excessive anthropogenic activities on the environment cause environmental degradation, which affects cities' resilience. Therefore, this paper introduces the study to develop an Environmental Resilience Index (ERI) designed to measure the level of environmental resilience in Malaysia by selecting Selangor as a case study because of the difference in economic activities that could result in a different level of resilience. This paper also explains the general framework and indicator selected for this study by a literature review of environmental systems and reviews of past research and established indicators. Though this study uses secondary data as the basis of data collection, data from authorised departments and agencies are gathered to verify the reliability and validity of data that is important in analysation. Lastly, this paper elaborates on the methodology of data analysis with an example by measuring the ERI level for the component of environmental resources for the State of Selangor.
