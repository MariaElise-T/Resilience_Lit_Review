The new design of a resilient element for application in drilling devices of vibration protection is presented. A cylindrical shell with a cut along its generatrix is the peculiarity of the proposed design. The presented resilient element has high loaded and damping properties upon cross dimension hard restriction condition. Besides, the design is simple, technological and low cost. The drilling shock absorber is tested, which is manufactured on the base of several slotted shell resilient elements, operating in parallel manner. A calculation method for slotted shell resilient elements for drilling devices vibration protection is given. This work presents results of slotted cylindrical shell study in conditions of contact interaction with a resilient filler. To provide the research, the authors have developed a verified numerical model of the shell resilient element with a slit and used iterative algorithms for contact problem solving, considering contact surface friction. The stress-strain state of the shell resilient element of the drilling shock absorber was analyzed. Strength of the structure is evaluated by the energy criterion. Hysteresis loops were developed and analyzed for some histories of resilient element cyclic loading. The obtained results make possible rather accurately to take into account effect of the shell and the filler material resilient characteristics, their geometrical parameters and tribological properties on operational characteristics of drilling devices for vibration protection. In its turn, this makes possible to use efficient drilling vibration protection devices, develop vibroinsulator shell designs by the criteria of maximum compliance and required damping level.
