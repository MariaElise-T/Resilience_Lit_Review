AbstractThis paper proposes a two‐stage stochastic scheduling model for urban distribution network resilience enhancement against ice storms, which coordinates mobile deicing equipment routing and distributed energy resources dispatching. An improved line ice thickness prediction model and a photovoltaic power generation prediction method in accordance with conditional generative adversarial networks are proposed to provide data boundaries for scheduling strategy. Facing the uncertainty of line failure, a two‐stage scenario‐based distribution network optimization model is established. At first stage, the mobile deicing equipment routing strategy is decided to mitigate the impact caused by ice storms. The Monte‐Carlo simulation method is introduced to describe the uncertainty of line failure due to ice acceleration. For the second stage, based on the results of photovoltaic forecasting and possible distribution line failure scenario generated by Monte‐Carlo simulation method, the optimal distributed energy resources dispatching strategy can be obtained through the mixed integer programming. The proposed model is simplified to a mixed integer linear programming model that can be solved by a commercial solver. The test results on the modified IEEE 33‐node system and modified 69‐node system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the resilience performance of urban distribution network under ice storms.
