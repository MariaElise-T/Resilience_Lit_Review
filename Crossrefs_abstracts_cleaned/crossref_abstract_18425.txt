AbstractThe growing interest in mimicry of biological skins greatly promotes the birth of high‐performance artificial skins. Chameleon skins can actively transform environmental information into bioelectrical and color‐change signals simultaneously through manipulating ion transduction and photonic nanostructures. Here, inspired by chameleon skins, a novel biomimetic chromotropic photonic‐ionic skin (PI‐skin) capable of outputting synergistic electrical and optical signals under strain with robust adhesion, stability, and resilience is ingeniously constructed. The PI‐skin exhibits sensitive structural color change synchronized with electrical response via adjusting the lattice spacing of the photonic crystal (mechanochromic sensitivity: 1.89 nm per %, Δλ > 150 nm). Notably, the polyzwitterionic network provides abundant electrostatic interactions, endowing the PI‐skin with excellent adhesion, environmental tolerance, and outstanding mechanical stability (>10 000 continuous cycles). Meanwhile, the high loading of ionic liquid (IL) weakens the electrostatic interaction between the polyzwitterionic molecular chains, leading to high resilience. The PI‐skin is finally applied to construct a visually interactive wearable device, realizing precise human motion monitoring, remote communication, and visual localization of pressure distribution. This work not only expands design ideas for the construction of advanced biomimetic I‐skins but also provides a general optical platform for high‐level visual interactive devices and smart wearable electronics.
