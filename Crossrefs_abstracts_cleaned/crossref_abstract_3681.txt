Developing climate-resilient wheat is a priority for South Asia since the effect of climate
change will be pronounced on the major crops that are staple to the region. South Asia must
produce >400 million metric tons (MMT) of wheat by 2050 to meet the demand. However, the current
average yield <3 t/ha is not sufficient to meet the requirement. In this review, we are addressing
how pre-breeding methods in wheat can address the gap in grain yield as well as reduce the
bottleneck of genetic diversity. Physiological pre-breeding which incorporates screening of diverse
germplasm from gene banks for physiological and agronomic traits, the strategic crossing of complementary
traits, high throughput phenotyping, molecular markers-based generation advancement,
genomic prediction, and validation of high-value heat and drought tolerant lines to South Asia can
help to alleviate the drastic effect of climate change on wheat production. There are several gene
banks, if utilized well, can play a major role in breeding for climate-resilient wheat. CIMMYTâ€™s
wheat physiological pre-breeding has delivered several hundred lines via the Stress Adapted Trait
Yield Nursery (SATYN) to the NARS in many South Asian countries; India, Pakistan, Nepal,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Iran. Some of these improved germplasms have resulted in varieties
for farmer's field. We conclude the review by pointing out the importance of collaborative interdisciplinary
translational research to alleviate the effects of climate change on wheat production in
South Asia.
