An overview of a research‐informed family resilience framework, developed as a conceptual map to guide clinical intervention and prevention efforts with vulnerable families is presented. Building on studies of individual and family resilience and developments in strength‐based approaches to family therapy, this practice approach is distinguished by its focus on strengthening family functioning in the context of adversity. Key processes that foster resilience are outlined, as are several innovative family systems training and service applications.
