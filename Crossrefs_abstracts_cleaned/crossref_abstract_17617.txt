In This study was designed to verify whether grit mediates the effect of mindset on resilience in writing liberal arts classes for college students and to verify the moderating effect of academic efficacy on the mediating model. In order to achieve this purpose, a research model was derived by considering previous studies. The results of the study are summarized as follows. First, it has been verified that grit mediates the effect of the growth mindset on resilience. Second, it was found that some pathways were controlled by academic efficacy. This shows that in order to increase the satisfaction of writing liberal arts classes, efforts should be made to support learners' mindsets and grits together with academic efficacy. The implications of this study are meaningful in that they consider the theoretical basis for teaching and learning support in writing classes.
