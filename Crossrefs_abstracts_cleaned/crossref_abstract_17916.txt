Abstract
This article analyzes the challenges and opportunities of Community-Based Tourism (CBT) in Pasir Eurih Village, which is the oldest village in Bogor Regency that has a lot of cultural tourism potentials. to improve social resilience. Moreover, this research incorporated qualitative methods using interviews and document analysis by integrating the Quadruple Helix concept. In addition, the Quadruple Helix concept is an approach comprising four elements, namely academic, government, industry, and local community, which need to be synergized with each other. As a result, the local communities in Pasir Eurih village were the most involved party in developing communal welfare through their tourism programs. It was also found that the governmentâ€™s guidance is not yet in accordance with the necessity of the village community and the program assistance is more top-down. Therefore, this study recommends all the four stakeholders to play their own parts without disregarding the internal communication among the actors to make the villages independent and resilient.
