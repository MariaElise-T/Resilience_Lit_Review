The current study aims to investigate the impact of floods in the rural areas of Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab, Pakistan. Floods are a natural disaster that wreak havoc across the country but have disproportionate consequences for different genders.  Flooding is a constant threat to the community resilience, especially in the remote areas. Lack of awareness and poverty makes the situation even more deplorable and triggers certain gendered issues in flood-affected areas. The prime concern of the current study is to highlight gendered issues, as an impact of floods in D.G. Khan Floods are a major natural disaster with greater impact on women rather than men due to work routine of the males. Floods have a major effect on the physical, social, and psychological aspects of a community which directly impact the lives of both men and women and increases their vulnerability. The current study has highlighted serious gender issues experienced by the inhabitants of D.G. Khan, further causing vulnerability for both genders, especially for women. Thereby, they become a more vulnerable part of the community.  The feeling of suffering and helplessness that follows a natural disaster has a devastating impact on the population. As a result, the current case study has concentrated on the vulnerability of both genders, as there is a need to instill community resilience in both.
