AbstractObjectiveSickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders. The central feature of this chronic condition is pain. Several identified risk factors exacerbate the impact of pain on quality of life (QOL) in SCD; however, there are relatively fewer investigations of strengths-based resilience variables that might buffer the influence of pain on living with SCD. The purpose of this study was to examine strength-based resilience processes in youth with SCD and their parents. Grounded in an ecological resilience-risk model, we evaluated whether adolescent and parent protective factors (pain acceptance, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility) moderated the relation between adolescent-reported pain burden and QOL.MethodsNinety-three 12- to 18-year-old adolescents with SCD and their parents participated. Adolescents completed assessments of pain characteristics, pain acceptance, mindfulness, and QOL. Parents completed instruments measuring demographic and disease variables and parent psychological flexibility.ResultsPain variables were associated with protective factors in predicted directions. Adolescent acceptance and mindfulness were positively correlated with QOL. Parent psychological flexibility and adolescent QOL were not related. After controlling for demographic, pain, and disease variables, moderation analyses indicated that adolescent pain acceptance buffered the relation between SCD pain burden and QOL. Moderation analyses were not significant for adolescent mindfulness or parent psychological flexibility.ConclusionsResults suggest that strengths-based factors may play an important role for adolescents’ QOL within the context of SCD pain. Interventions that enhance teenagers’ ability to accept pain might be particularly useful to improve QOL in adolescents living with SCD pain.
