Background:
Lack of resiliency contributes to growing dissatisfaction among newly licensed nurses (NLNs) and often leads to clinical errors and job resignations.


Method:
An integrative review synthesized current research investigating NLNs' resiliency within their first year of hire and interventions that may affect their resiliency.


Results:
Key database searches (2008 to 2018) yielded 16 studies. Insufficient resiliency among NLNs has been correlated with intentions to leave current jobs and decreased job satisfaction. Residency programs, well-prepared preceptors, and peer support promoted NLN resilience and enhanced patient safety. Lack of coworker support has led to NLNs' intentions to leave their current jobs or the profession entirely.


Conclusion:

              NLN turnover has been interpreted to be an outcome of poor NLN resilience. The first year of practice is stressful and affects NLNs' mental health and cognitive reasoning, thereby risking patient safety. Resiliency should be measured using a resiliency scale rather than turnover rates.
