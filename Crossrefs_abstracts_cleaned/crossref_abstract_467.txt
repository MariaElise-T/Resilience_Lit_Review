We evaluated the effect of three self-regulatory processes on the relationship between affect and counterproductive workplace behaviour intentions (CWBi) in the context of employees receiving performance feedback using a moderated mediation approach. Using vignettes, participants were given job performance feedback and completed measures of affect, workplace resiliency, and CWBi. Using 292 employed participants, we found that two self-regulatory components of workplace resiliency moderated the relationship between feedback type and CWBi, as mediated by negative affect. This suggests that the more one engages in self-regulation, the less likely they are to engage in counterproductive workplace behaviours following an adverse workplace experience.
