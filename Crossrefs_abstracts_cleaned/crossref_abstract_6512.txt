The incessant social, cultural and economic changes in which society is immersed, does require developing coping skills towards change that allow teenagers to successfully develop as active subjects of society.  Within this framework, the school environment is considered an ideal scenario to work resilience in the adolescent stage.  Based on these considerations, the objective of this research is the approach to the reality of adolescents and their resilience.  For this, a descriptive analysis is carried out with 193 teenagers from various schools in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (CAPV).  The results show significant differences in resilient capacities related to the age and sex of the participating adolescents.
