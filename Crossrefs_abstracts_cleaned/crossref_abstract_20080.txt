 The integration of automation into clinical workflows has increased since 2004. As the next healthcare era (i.e., Health Care 4.0) approaches, it is important to understand how human-automation interaction has evolved. The objective of this research was to perform a scoping literature review on trust in automation in healthcare systems focused on: (1) Understanding the extent to which responsivity and resiliency are studied in trust in automation and (2) Understanding the extent to which automation is studied from a systems thinking perspective. This review evaluated published works between 2004 and early 2022 to determine gaps in the current literature related to evaluating trust in automation in healthcare. Over 5,000 articles were identified during the literature review process using three databases. Twenty-four articles matched the inclusion criteria of being empirical research conducted within hospital environments. The findings of this scoping literature review identify future research opportunities for investigating trust in automation.
