Natural disasters, wars, economic collapses, or some combination of these stretch far back in history. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic downturn is the latest example of a globally unsettling event. However, while the crisis is global not every region will react, and most
 importantly, recover in the same way. Examples of resilience to such events can be found and studied at local levels, such as municipalities, all the way up to the differences in responses by nations. Learning the lessons from previous challenges is key to mitigating future ones. Focusing
 locally on cities and their resiliency in the face of economic and social upheaval is an important foundation for this type of research. In Japan, Professors Takashi Yamamoto, Masaaki Takemura and Mayuri Ishida are now collaborating to investigate how to increase the economic resilience of
 regional cities within the country. Together they developed and have been conducting a series of research projects, which ultimately intend to increase the number and strength of economically resilient regional cities in Japan.
