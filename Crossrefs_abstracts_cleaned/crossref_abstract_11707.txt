 Change is a central feature of the early care and education landscape today. Much of the research on educational change focuses on the negative or challenging aspects of change. This study employed a critical theory framework from the organizational sciences field, positive organizational scholarship, to offer a new way of thinking about change in the early care and education field. This article examines the positive dynamics of change and collective resilience in the implementation of a new early care and education professional development system in one US state. Data sources included 60 in-depth interviews with professional development providers and state education agency staff, meeting observations, and document review. This positive organizational scholarship lens revealed multiple positive processes, including compassion, mutual support, and participantsâ€™ ability to make sense of, adapt to, and positively contribute to change. Furthermore, results show how specific communication structures fostered relationships among participants that enabled these positive change dynamics. The article suggests ways that change efforts can be designed to intentionally enable positive change and strengthen collective resilience in the early care and education field.
