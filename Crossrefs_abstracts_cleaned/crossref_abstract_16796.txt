AbstractThis article reports a multicity 1‐year long study on the effect of a customized spiritual education programme (SEP) on parenting and in turn its mediated effect on resilience building for children with acute anxiety symptoms. The treatment group comprised 3,689 primary caregiver parents who participated in the SEP and their children clinically diagnosed with acute anxiety symptoms, from 180 schools across 15 cities. Equal number of primary caregiver parents and children were assigned to the control group. Results showed that post‐test scores of treatment group primary caregiver parents were higher on the parenting style questionnaires, indicating an improved and authoritative parenting style. This positive effect of the SEP on parenting in turn had a mediating effect on resilience of their children, who scored higher on the outcome measures in the post‐treatment phase. Parenting and resilience outcome measures varied due to socio‐economic and SEP‐related variables. Children's perception of post‐treatment parenting influenced their resilience. Findings suggest that SEP could aid positive parenting and hence positive behavioural outcomes in children.
