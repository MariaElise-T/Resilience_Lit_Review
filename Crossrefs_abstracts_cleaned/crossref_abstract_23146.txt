AbstractResilience is the ability to cope with critical situations through the use of personal and socially mediated resources. Since a lack of resilience increases the risk of developing stress‐related psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), a better understanding of the biological background is of great value to provide better prevention and treatment options. Resilience is undeniably influenced by genetic factors, but very little is known about the exact underlying mechanisms. A recently published genome‐wide association study (GWAS) on resilience has identified three new susceptibility loci, DCLK2, KLHL36, and SLC15A5. Further interesting results can be found in association analyses of gene variants of the stress response system, which is closely related to resilience, and PTSD and MDD. Several promising genes, such as the COMT (catechol‐O‐methyltransferase) gene, the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) suggest gene × environment interaction between genetic variants, childhood adversity, and the occurrence of PTSD and MDD, indicating an impact of these genes on resilience. GWAS on PTSD and MDD provide another approach to identifying new disease‐associated loci and, although the functional significance for disease development for most of these risk genes is still unknown, they are potential candidates due to the overlap of stress‐related psychiatric disorders and resilience. In the future, it will be important for genetic studies to focus more on resilience than on pathological phenotypes, to develop reasonable concepts for measuring resilience, and to establish international cooperations to generate sufficiently large samples.
