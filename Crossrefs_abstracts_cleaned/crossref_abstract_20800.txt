Potatoes have emerged as a key non-grain crop for food security worldwide. However, the looming threat of climate change poses significant risks to this vital food source, particularly through the projected reduction in crop yields under warmer temperatures. To mitigate potential crises, the development of potato varieties through genome editing holds great promise. In this study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis to investigate microtuber development and identified several differentially expressed genes, with a particular focus on ribosomal proteins—RPL11, RPL29, RPL40 and RPL17. Our results reveal, by protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses, performed with the highest confidence in the STRING database platform (v11.5), the critical involvement of these ribosomal proteins in microtuber development, and highlighted their interaction with PEBP family members as potential microtuber activators. The elucidation of the molecular biological mechanisms governing ribosomal proteins will help improve the resilience of potato crops in the face of today’s changing climatic conditions.
