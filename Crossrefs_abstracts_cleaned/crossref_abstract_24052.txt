Microenterprises continue to hold the promise of economic success for many
            countries, but many of these businesses are thought to be the most vulnerable to failure
            following the economic shock caused by COVID-19. This study looked into how resilience
            helped microenterprise owner-managers succeed after an economic shock. The study
            specifically looked at the role of self-directed learning as a mediator in the link
            between resilience and success of microenterprises in North Central Nigeria. Our
            research discovered a strong and significant link between success, self-directed
            learning, and resilience. It should be emphasised that while resilient owner-managers
            can have a positive and significant impact on the success of microenterprises, the
            impact of self-directed learning further supports and enriches their businesses in times
            of challenging business circumstances.
