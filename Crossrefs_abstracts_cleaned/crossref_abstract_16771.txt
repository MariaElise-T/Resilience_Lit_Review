            The purpose of the current study was to explore resilience in senior-level baccalaureate nursing students. Twenty-seven participants completed an online questionnaire assessing three stressors that pertained to marriage or divorce, death or loss of family members or close friends, and extreme financial hardship in the past 1 year. Resilience was measured using the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) and one open-ended question about the experience of resilience. Mean CD-RISC-25 score was 73.26 (

            = 10.7; range = 45 to 96); only 33.3% of the sample was considered resilient (score >80). Qualitative data described academic stressors and support resources for resilience. Study findings underscore the relevance of resilience in nursing students. Nurse educators must help nursing students develop resilience to better prepare them for academic success and ensure a smooth transition into their professional nursing role. [
