This study examines the factors that can enhance student's academic resilience rom positive psychological perspective. The findings of the study show that protective factors such as relationships, high expectations and significant involvement are the dimensions that can improve the resilience of students who have divorced parents. Distance is not a barrier to parents who do not stay with their children if the communication mediums such as phones and the internet are used to show care, convey parents’ expectations and build strong bonding with the children. The problem of divorce may never be totally dismissed from our society.  However, the least we can do is to provide a conducive and functional environment which can make students from the divorced parents more resilient.
