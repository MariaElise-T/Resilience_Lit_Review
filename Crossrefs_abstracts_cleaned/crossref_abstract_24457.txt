Significance
The rate at which ecosystems recover from disturbance can greatly influence their resilience to environmental change. We used more than a decade of satellite data to model how the extraordinarily biodiverse shrublands of South Africa recover following fire and how recovery rates vary with temperature and precipitation across the region. We found that climate strongly affects how quickly plant communities can recover after fire. We also used global climate models to project ecosystem recovery into the future and found that warmer winter temperatures will likely speed up postfire recovery unless precipitation declines as temperature increases (as some models project).
