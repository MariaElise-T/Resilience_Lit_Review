The aim of the research is to examine the predictive effects of self-efficacy and psychological resilience on sportsmanship behavior in high school students. The study group consisted of 605 students who were studying in two state secondary schools in Turkey. In the study, the "Physical Education Course Sportsmanship Behavior Scale", the "Selfefficacy Scale for Children", the "Child and Youth Resilience Measure‚Äù and a personal information form created by the researcher were used. The effect of students' self-efficacy and psychological resilience levels on their sportsmanship behaviors was examined by Path Analysis. The analysis results also showed that social self-efficacy significantly affected positive sportsmanship behaviors, and academic self-efficacy affected negative sportsmanship behaviors. When the Squared Multiple Correlations value of the model is considered, it is seen that 5% of positive sportsmanship behaviors and 4% of negative sportsmanship behaviors are explained by the model. As a result, it was found that the social self-efficacy level of the students was a significant predictor of positive sportsmanship behaviors, and the academic self-efficacy level was a significant predictor of negative sportsmanship behaviors. It was determined that the model designed in the research explained the sportsmanship behavior of the students at a low level.
