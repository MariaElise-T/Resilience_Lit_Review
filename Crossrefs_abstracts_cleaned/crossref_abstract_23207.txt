Background: Recent life events may be significant risk factors for depression during pregnancy. However, its association with the individual’s resilience and social support is not clear. Aims: To understand the association between life events and depression during pregnancy and whether the association is moderated by resilience and social support. Methods: This study is part of a prospective cohort study on perinatal mental health in an urban antenatal clinic, which included 589 women recruited in the first and early second trimester. Participants were administered the Life Events Checklist adapted from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale by the authors to assess life events; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale-10 to assess depression and resilience, respectively. The relationship between life events (12 months prior to the time of assessment) and antenatal depression and the moderating role of resilience and social support was analysed. Results: Thirty-eight women (6.5%) who had depression (EPDS score ⩾ 11) had significantly higher number of life events (i.e. on average three; U = 3,826; p < .01), lower resilience scores ( U = 4,053; p < .01) and lower perceived social support ( U = 2,423; p < .01) as compared to those who were negative for depression on EPDS. Life events predicted depression during pregnancy; however, the relationship was moderated by social support but not by resilience. Conclusion: The pregnant women who experienced life events may experience depression during the first trimester of pregnancy, but the effect could possibly be reduced by enhancing the social support.
