Resilience and working environment are variables that affect turnover. However, how these two variables impact each other is unclear. This study is a descriptive correlation study to identify the factors of the nursing working environment affecting the resilience of new nurses in general tertiary hospitals. This study was conducted by convenience sampling of 233 new nurses with less than 1 year of working experience. Data were collected through questionnaires from 20 to 27 October 2019, and analyzed using correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results show that the work environment impacts the resilience of new nurses by 30.2%. Specifically, the following qualities of a work environment were found to affect new nurses’ resilience, including “nursing foundation for quality of care”, “nurse participation in hospital affairs”, “nurse manager ability, leadership, and support of nurses”, “collegial nurse–physician relations”, and “staffing and resource adequacy”. These findings imply that a satisfactory working environment improves new nurses’ resilience and reduces their intent to leave their workplace. Further studies are needed to elucidate this relationship, especially considering the ever-changing work environments.
