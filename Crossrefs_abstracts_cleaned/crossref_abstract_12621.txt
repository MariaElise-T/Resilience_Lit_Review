Recently, aromatic oil (AO) is one of the substances that is typically used as a processing aid especially for high filler loadings in formulating rubber compound. Aromatic oil has disadvantages in that, it is hazardous to environment, toxic and has been labeled as carcinogenic. In this research, an epoxidised oil (EO) and aromatic oil were used to investigate the effect incorporation of oil onto the SBR/NR natural rubber vulcanizates (NR). From the result obtained, EO showed shorter cure time and scorch time as the oil loading were increased up to 20 pphr of EO. Physical properties such as hardness and rebound resilience of NR/EO vulcanisate were also investigated upon exposure to different humidity level in humidity chamber. At room temperature, the hardness of EO loading onto the SBR/NR vulcanisate is lower than AO loadings. Hardness was slightly decreased with increasing rate of humidity. There is great difference in hardness and rebound resilience values between AO and EO. Both hardness and rebound resilience were not affected by humidity. This implies the existence of good filler interaction with EO and rubber which do not impart changes in the hardness and resilience properties of rubber compound. Epoxidised oil has great promising potential to replace the carcinogenic aromatic oil as it has good overall performance and renewable in nature .
