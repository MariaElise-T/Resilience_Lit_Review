Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been gaining a major interest for use in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for Disaster Response and Tactical applications. These CPS generate a very large amount of mission-critical and personal data that require resilient and secure storage and sharing. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a framework for resilient data storage and sharing for MEC in CPS targeting the aforementioned applications. Our framework is built on the resiliency of three main components: EdgeKeeper, which ensures resilient coordination of the framework’s components; RSock, which provides resilient communication among CPS’s nodes; and R-Drive/R-Share which, leveraging EdgeKeeper and RSock, provides resilient data storage and sharing. EdgeKeeper employs a set of replicas and a consensus protocol for storing critical meta-data and ensuring fast reorganization of the CPS; RSock decides an optimal degree for replicating data that is communicated over lossy links. R-Drive employs an adaptive erasure-coded and encrypted resilient data storage; R-Share, leveraging RSock provides resilient peer-to-peer data sharing. We implemented our proposed framework on rapidly deployable systems (e.g. manpacks, testMobile Edge Clouds) and on Android devices, and integrated it with existing MEC applications. Performance evaluation results from three real-world deployments show that our framework provides resilient data storage and sharing in MEC for CPS.
