Abstract
In this article, we study how declining rural communities build political resilience in Finland. Community resilience is an adaptive process through which rural communities try to maintain their viability in changed circumstances. This process does not entail a submissive attitude, but rather active agency and an effort to influence matters concerning the communityâ€™s well-being. We focus on the political dimension of resilience by identifying different local tactics that rural communities adopt to promote their own development following municipal mergers. We classify these tactics into three categories: cooperation, conflict and community-led development. The significant differences between them lie in how the community relates to the new municipality and communicates with its officials and decision-makers. However, none of the three tactics identified in our study are sufficient to ensure the viability of rural communities in the context of municipal mergers.
