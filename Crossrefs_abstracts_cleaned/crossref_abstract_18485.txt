Introduction. High turnover of nurses in rural healthcare settings contributes to challenges in healthcare delivery. Various incentive packages have been introduced in rural healthcare settings to curb this phenomenon, but the canker still exists. The study aimed at assessing the predictive role of job satisfaction, rural fit, and resilience on nurses’ retention in rural Ghana. Materials and Methods. A multicentre cross-sectional design was adopted to collect data from 462 nurses. Analysis through descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, Pearson moment product correlation, and multiple regression was done. Results. There was low resilience and rural fit among nurses with higher turnover intention, which was predicted by average daily attendance (β = 0.108), rural fit (β = −0.144), resilience (β = −0.350), satisfaction with prospects (β = −0.187), and satisfaction with prospect and pay (β = −0.171) at the significance of 0.05. Conclusion. Policymakers can be assured that not just improving financial incentives to nurses, but the integration of nurses to rural settings, commensurate workload and improving pay and prospects for professional growth and resilience are needed for rural retention. Implications for nursing management, nurse managers, and policymakers have a role to develop sustainable strategies to integrate rural fit, resilience, and job satisfaction to help reduce turnover among nurses.
