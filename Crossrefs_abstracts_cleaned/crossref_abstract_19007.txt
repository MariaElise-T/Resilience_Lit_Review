Natural and man-made disasters are becoming more frequent and intense causing cascade effects hindering the sustainable progress of humanity and countries. For better protection of people, disaster risk forecasting, disaster planning and disaster risk reduction are essential. The purpose of the article is to assess the readiness of medical institutions of Irkutsk for emergency situations. The studies were conducted on the basis of Irkutsk regional blood transfusion station. A field survey of the facility by employees and recommendations of security service experts were used. The method for assessing the security of educational and medical institutions includes three stages: filling out an evaluation card; rationing of indicators; getting total sustainability values. Resilience indicators were grouped by disaster types into four groups: resistance to earthquakes, strong wind and hurricanes, floods, and fires. The results indicate that the institution is not properly protected from emergency situations. The data allowed us to calculate a stability index for the institution and draw conclusions about the need for additional measures to ensure sustainable operation in case of emergency situations.
