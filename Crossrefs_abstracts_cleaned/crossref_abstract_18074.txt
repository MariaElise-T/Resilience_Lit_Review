This study explores the impact of the digital economy on the resilience of the food system, employing data from 190 towns in China and a difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results indicate that, between 2011 and 2020, the progress of the digital economy was instrumental in driving continuous improvements in the food system’s resilience in China. This conclusion stands firm after accounting for endogenous issues and conducting comprehensive robustness tests. According to a mechanism test, the digital economy can impact the resilience of the food system through three avenues: digital technology, digital finance, and human capital. Further research indicates that the influence of the digital economy on the resilience of the food system varies across regions and different food functional zones. These findings offer fresh insights and empirical evidence into the linkages between the digital economy and food system resilience. Such insights may bolster the food system’s resilience in developing countries and promote sustainable food development.
