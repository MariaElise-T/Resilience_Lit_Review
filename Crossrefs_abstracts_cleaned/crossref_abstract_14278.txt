Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of Video conferencing (VC) applications towards building institutional resilience and facilitate educational continuity in Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs). Through our study, we aimed to uncover mental reflections of faculty based on their experiences in using VC platforms for handling online classes.


Design/methodology/approach
Data were collected primarily through semi structured interviews with 25 Business school faculty from India, supplemented with data from observation and secondary sources. Following the Gioia approach, a conceptual framework was developed using the identified themes and dimensions.


Findings
The study revealed that low self-regulation, learner disengagement, need for top management support and instructor challenges were the aggregate dimensions that required focused attention while using tools such as VC applications towards designing effective institutional resilience interventions for educational continuity.


Practical implications
Findings of this study may help the policy-makers of HEIs in developing an effective plan to increase the effectiveness of educational resilience interventions in the digital learning environments. The implications are much wider than the scope of higher education landscape and may be extended to the corporate learning and development lexicon.


Originality/value
This study is an early attempt that employed a systematic qualitative approach to explore and capture mental reflections of faculty on the use of VC applications towards building institutional resilience for educational continuity during crisis situations.
