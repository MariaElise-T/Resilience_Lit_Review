Highlights

Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs) may be mitigated by trauma‐informed social environments.
However, there is little empirical evidence that show how community approaches can address ACEs.
A participatory change process was implemented by a community coalition in response to ACEs.
Data was used to track implementation, generate hypotheses and guide a community response to ACEs.
Results show how one community initiated steps to build a resilient, trauma‐informed community.
