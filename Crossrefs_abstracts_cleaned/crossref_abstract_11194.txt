PurposeThis study aims to examine the interrelationship between resilience, robustness and bullwhip effect using an inventory- and order-based production control system being subjected to operational disruption in the customer demand process.Design/methodology/approachControl engineering techniques and simulation are employed for the supply chain dynamics study.FindingsThe results show that resilience and robustness are two conflicting performance characteristics and therefore, a tradeoff can be established between them. It is also observed that improvement in resilience and reduction of bullwhip effect can be achieved simultaneously through a proper selection of control parameters.Originality/valueThe work establishes a relationship between the resilient behavior of a supply chain and bullwhip effect.
