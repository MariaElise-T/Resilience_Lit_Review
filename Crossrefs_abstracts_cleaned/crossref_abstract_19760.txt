AbstractAimThere have been few studies done looking at the relationship between resilience, Type D personality, and self‐care behavior in patients with heart failure. The purpose of this study was to identify the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between Type D personality and self‐care behavior in patients with heart failure.MethodsThe subjects consisted of a sample of 90 heart failure patients aged ≥20 years who visited the cardiology outpatient clinic in the Chungbuk area of South Korea.ResultsAmong 90 patients, 49 subjects (54.0%) were classified as Type D personality, who exhibited statistically significant differences in resilience and self‐care behavior (p < .001). A statistically significant correlation was also observed between self‐care behavior score and resilience score (p < .01). The resilience had full mediation effects on the relationship between Type D personality and self‐care behavior. In other words, the higher their resilience, the better their self‐care behavior.ConclusionsThe study showed that resilience and Type D personality have important effects on self‐care behavior.
