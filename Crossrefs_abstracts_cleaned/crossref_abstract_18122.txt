PurposeThe aim of this article is to shed light on the impact of intangible resources, such as organizational learning (OL), organizational agility (OA) and organizational innovativeness (OI), on supply chain resilience (SCR). For this, a theoretical model is developed to analyze the development of relationships between chosen resource variables.Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on a cross-sectional questionnaire. Survey data were collected from 180 businesses including only medium to senior level managers to ensure a thorough understanding about the company's inner workings and supply chain (SC). The validity of the model is determined using structural equation modeling (SEM) and tested using lavaan package in R.FindingsThe findings indicate a statistically significant relationship between OL and SCR. Two organizational resource constructs, OI and OA, are found to have a strong mediating effect on this relationship. OL ability mediated by OA and OI results in increased SCR.Research limitations/implicationsThe data cover multiple sectors but are collected from one country. The dataset is also limited in that it is collected from mid- to high-level managers working on manufacturing and supply chain-related departments.Practical implicationsThe authors believe that the results of this study will guide both managers and academics in developing effective measures to avoid SC disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic or other comparable risks.Originality/valueThis is the first study that examines the relationship between OL and SCR. Prior studies have examined the relationship between OA and SCR. However, OL and OI, in particular, have not featured frequently in SCR-related studies. In this regard, this research is also unique in that it examines the mediating role of OA and OI in the relationship between OL and SCR.
