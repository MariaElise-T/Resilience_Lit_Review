This paper proposes an optimization model of supply chain resilience strategy for large passenger aircraft. A quality function deployment (QFD) framework is conducted to analyze the resilience of the large passenger aircraft supply chain, and the key parameters are characterized based on the probabilistic linguistic term. Then based on the output of the QFD framework an optimization model of the resilience strategy considering the stochastic disturbance faced by the supply chain is constructed. Taking the supply chain for large aircraft cockpit control display module as an example to illustrate the application steps and feasibility of the model, the results demonstrate that change of supply chain management responsibilities, implementing hierarchical management of suppliers, seeking coordinated implementation of inventory management mode, and improving the pre-risk identification system, play prominent roles in enhancing supply chain resilience, and the combination of different strategies can indeed enhance the supply chain resilience under the budget constraint.
