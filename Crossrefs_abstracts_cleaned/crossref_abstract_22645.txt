Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results.  Participants described their experiences of mental health well‐being in relation to: social isolation and loneliness; social worth; self‐determination; and security. Strategies utilised include promoting resilience by maintaining community connections and relationships, keeping active, and emotional, practical and spiritual coping.Conclusion.  The findings highlight the importance of maintaining mental health well‐being through resilience. Although there were some variations between countries, these strategies for maintaining well‐being transcended culture and nation.Relevance to clinical practice.  Listening to older people through research such as the current study will help to determine what help is needed and how healthcare and policy makers can assist.
