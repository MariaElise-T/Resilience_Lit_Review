 Although shame is one of the most primitive and universal of human emotions, it is often still considered a taboo topic among researchers, practitioners, and clients. This paper presents the empirical foundation for shame resilience theory–-a new theory for understanding shame and its impact on women. Using grounded theory methodology, 215 women were interviewed to determine why and how women experience shame and to identify the various processes and strategies women use to develop shame resilience. The article describes the major theoretical categories, including acknowledged vulnerability, critical awareness, and mutually empathic relationships, and introduces the concept of “speaking shame.” Practice implications are explored, including the importance of psychoeducational group work in building shame resilience.
