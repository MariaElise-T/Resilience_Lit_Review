Social entrepreneurship (SE) has gained recognition as a key driver of the economy significantly contributing to innovation and inclusive growth. It is increasingly seen as a practical and effective solution to address a range of physical, social, economic and environmental challenges. Its role has also been critical in groundbreaking innovations toward sustainable development. Disaster risk management (DRM) planning is crucial for building resilience in the entrepreneurial ecosystem as SEs are highly vulnerable to the impacts of disasters, particularly in absence of DRM planning. This study explores the impact of disasters on SE and argues for the need for integrating DRM approaches to enhance the resilience of SE in line with the priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.  Despite India's strong performance in terms of supportive business start-up ecosystems, vulnerability to natural disasters and poor preparedness pose significant challenges to its development efforts. There is a need for greater attention to be paid to DRM planning in the SE sector in order to build resilience and ensure the long-term sustainability of SE initiatives.
