AbstractIntroductionOccupational stress and burnout are well‐recognised experiences reported by cancer care workers. The aim was to describe the frequency and severity of potential stressors as well as the effectiveness of coping skills of radiation therapists (RTs) and oncology nurses (ONs), which make up the two largest occupational groups in cancer care.MethodsA questionnaire was distributed to RTs and ONs in two large tertiary hospitals in Queensland. Descriptive data regarding severity of potential stressors at home and work as well as the perceived effectiveness of preferred coping styles for each stressor was compared for each professional group. Respondents were asked questions about their personal circumstances and to also complete five standardised questionnaires measuring resilience, mental well‐being, depression, anxiety and burnout.ResultsThere were 71 respondents representing a response rate of 26%. The types of stressors differed between the two groups but both reported that heavy workload was the most severe workplace stressor. RTs reported higher stressor and coping strategy frequency than ONs. There were no identifiable differences between RTs and ONs in the types or effectiveness of coping strategies employed at home or work. Mental well‐being for both groups was inversely correlated with depression, anxiety and burnout and positively correlated with resilience.ConclusionsRTs experienced higher mean scores for stressors and coping than ONs. There were no significant between‐group differences for anxiety, depression, burnout, mental well‐being or resilience.
