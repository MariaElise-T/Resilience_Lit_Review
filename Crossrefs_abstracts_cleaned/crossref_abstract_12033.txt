Entering college is a challenging phase as students have to experience adjustment problems which in turns significantly influence psychological wellbeing and educational attainment. The study intended to explore the mediational function of resilience within adjustment problems, academic achievement and depression. Sample (N = 880) was selected with age ranged from 16-26 years through purposive sampling from four universities of Lahore. Adjustment Problems Scale (Kazmi & Muazzam, 2017), Psychological Resilience Scale (Jawahir, 2013) and Siddiqui Shah Depression Scale (Siddiqui & Shah, 1992) were used to assess major constructs of the study. Results demonstrated a positive relation between adjustment problems and depression while inverse relation existed between adjustment problems and academic achievement. Likewise, depression positively predicted adjustment problems while adjustment problems inversely predicted academic achievement. Additionally, resilience mediated the relationship between adjustment problems and depression as well as between adjustment problems and academic achievement. The present findings would be useful for clinical psychologists/ counselors for the initial screening and managing adjustment problems in students.
