PurposeResilient route selection for oversized cargoes, one of the general bulk cargoes, has not been adequately optimized in terms of using the Arctic route. This study solves the problem of selecting the optimal shipping routes for oversized cargoes from Busan (South Korea) to Balkhash (Kazakhstan).Design/methodology/approachThe study used the consistent fuzzy preference relation (CFPR) method, which is used to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and uncertainty problems, to tackle the route selection. This method involves three procedures: first, the critical factors and alternative routes were obtained by the previous literature and an in-depth interview of experts of oversized cargo-handling with more than 20 years of working experience; second, the weightings for each critical factor were identified using the CFPR calculation process and third, alternative routes were evaluated using weighted critical factors.FindingsThe Northern Sea Route (NSR) combined with the inland waterways of Russia and Kazakhstan was first suggested for bulk carriers that handle oversized cargoes. The NSR could be a suitable route from Busan to Cape Kamenny of the Russian transshipment seaport, where oversized cargoes will be transferred to the river barge at Cape Kamenny, covering 4,913 km from the latter to Balkhash of Kazakhstan via the Ob/Irtysh River.Practical implicationsThis study equips stakeholders in route selection for cargoes with strategies and methods to improve transportation efficiently and enhance shipping routes between Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In addition to oversized cargoes, coal and timber from Russia can be transported to Asia using inland waterways and the NSR, which can also be used to transport plant equipment for petroleum refineries among Asian countries.Originality/valueThis is the first study to evaluate the suitability of the Artic route for oversized cargoes from South Korea to Kazakhstan. It provides a comprehensive evaluation framework of multimodal shipping routes and offers references for decision-makers when dealing with similar problems.
