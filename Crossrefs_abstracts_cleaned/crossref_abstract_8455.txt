Civilian protection mandates in United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations have become increasingly common since 1999.

This leaves some UN peacekeeping operations in the perilous position of working to protect civilians at the operational level without addressing some of the key structural conditions that give rise to violence against civilians.
