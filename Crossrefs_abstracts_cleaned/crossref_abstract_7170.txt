Sustainable agriculture and food system resilience are two interrelated things where the assessment of the sustainability of social, ecological, economic and consumption aspects is the main consideration in assessing the resilience of a food system. Kampong Cireundeu is an area that has a group of people who choose staple foods made from cassava instead of rice. Food systems are exposed to natural environmental resources that can be utilized (ecological conditions), political policies and structures, consumption culture and social safety nets that exist in society. This study aims to analyze the conditions of the resilience of the existing food system in Kampong Cireundeu. The food system in Kampong Cireundeu also implements sustainable agriculture. There are four dimensions that are used to explain the resilience of the food system in Kampong Cireundeu, where all three aspects are also included in the indication of sustainable agriculture. The four dimensions are (1) Ecological Dimensions; (2) Economic Dimensions; (3) Consumption Dimensions; (4) Social Dimensions. All of these dimensions are analyzed and the authors conclude that the food system in Kampong Cireundeu is in a vulnerable condition but the choice of cassava staple food could increase the resilience of the food system.
