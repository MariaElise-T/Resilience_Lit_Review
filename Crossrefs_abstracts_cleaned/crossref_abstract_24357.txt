AbstractUnderstanding the physiological basis of physical resilience to clinical stressors is crucial for the well‐being of older adults. This article presents a novel framework to discover the biological underpinnings of physical resilience in older adults as part of the “Characterizing Resiliencies to Physical Stressors in Older Adults: A Dynamical Physiological Systems Approach” study, also known as The Study of Physical Resilience and Aging (SPRING). Physical resilience, defined as the capacity of a person to withstand clinical stressors and quickly recover or improve upon a baseline functional level, is examined in adults aged 55 years and older by studying the dynamics of stress response systems. The hypothesis is that well‐regulated stress response systems promote physical resilience. The study employs dynamic stimulation tests to assess energy metabolism, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the innate immune system. Baseline characteristics influencing resilience outcomes are identified through deep phenotyping of physical and cognitive function, as well as of biological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics. SPRING aims to study participants undergoing knee replacement surgery (n = 100), bone and marrow transplantation (n = 100), or anticipating dialysis initiation (n = 60). Phenotypic and functional measures are collected pre‐stressor and at multiple times after stressor for up to 12 months to examine resilience trajectories. By improving our understanding of physical resilience in older adults, SPRING has the potential to enhance resilient outcomes to major clinical stressors. The article provides an overview of the study's background, rationale, design, pilot phase, implementation, and implications for improving the health and well‐being of older adults.
