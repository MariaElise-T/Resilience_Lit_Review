Abstract

Purpose
This study generated an understanding of familial resiliency following an adolescent’s stroke and what resiliency-related outcomes were important to this family.


Design and Methods
A qualitative case study design was used to collect data during an in-person interview. The interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis.


Findings
Participants’ narratives revealed that reengaging and establishing new activities, reconstructing identities, and changing perceptions regarding health and life itself were important resiliency-related outcomes.


Conclusions
The findings from this case study highlight innovative strategies that can be used to facilitate resiliency during strenuous times in a family’s life, such as following an adolescent’s stroke.


Clinical Relevance
Clinicians and service providers have the opportunity to help facilitate resiliency by identifying which protective factors and positive outcomes are most important to a family following an adolescent’s stroke, allowing clinicians to assist in achieving these outcomes. This research illustrates ways for families to convert resources into personally meaningful resiliency-related outcomes. Further research is needed to study familial resiliency as a part of an intervention to promote occupational engagement.
