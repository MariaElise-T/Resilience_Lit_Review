AbstractThis study aimed to evaluate a mentoring programme embedded in a work‐based personal resilience enhancement intervention for forensic nurses. This qualitative study formed part of a wider mixed‐methods study that aimed to implement and evaluate the intervention. Twenty‐four semistructured interviews were carried out with forensic nurse mentees and senior nurse mentors; these explored their experiences of the mentoring programme and any benefits and challenges involved in constructing and maintaining a mentor–mentee relationship. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using the Framework Method. Four key themes relating to the initiation and maintenance of mentor–mentee relationships were identified: finding time and space to arrange mentoring sessions; building rapport and developing the relationship; setting expectations of the mentoring relationship and the commitment required; and the impact of the mentoring relationship for both mentees and mentors. Study findings highlight the benefits of senior nurses mentoring junior staff and provide evidence to support the integration of mentoring programmes within wider work‐based resilience enhancement interventions. Effective mentoring can lead to the expansion of professional networks, career development opportunities, increased confidence and competence at problem‐solving, and higher levels of resilience, well‐being, and self‐confidence.
