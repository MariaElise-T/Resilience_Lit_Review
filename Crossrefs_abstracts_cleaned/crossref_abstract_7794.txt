Chickpea, an important legume crop high in protein mostly grown under rainfed circumstances in arid and semi-arid climates, where it is extremely subject to abiotic stresses like drought, terminal stress, temperature, water logging at different growth stages throughout the season linked to severe yield losses, particularly when the crop is subjected to unfavorable conditions during the reproductive period, leading to instability in chickpea production around the world. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the strategies employed for ameliorating abiotic stress and enhancing climate change resilience in chickpea. It examines the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of chickpea plants to abiotic stress and explores the underlying mechanisms involved in stress tolerance. The review highlights the importance of understanding the genetic basis of stress tolerance traits and emphasizes the potential for genetic improvement through breeding and genetic engineering approaches. It examines the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of chickpea plants to abiotic stress and explores the underlying mechanisms involved in stress tolerance. It discusses the identification of stress-responsive genes, proteins, and metabolites, which can serve as potential targets for crop improvement and the development of stress-tolerant chickpea varieties. In conclusion, this comprehensive review provides valuable insights into the amelioration of abiotic stress and climate change resilience in chickpea. It synthesizes current knowledge, identifies research gaps, and offers practical recommendations for sustainable chickpea production under challenging environmental conditions.
