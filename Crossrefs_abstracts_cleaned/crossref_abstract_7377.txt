ABSTRACT Objectives: To analyze and reflect on the potential applicability of the contribution of the physical resilience conceptual model of Whitson et al. in the care for older adults. Method: The present article of reflection was structured based on the consultation of articles and definition of inherent concepts, with analysis and reason of the potentialities of its application in geriatric nursing care. Results: Physical resilience is influenced by diverse stimuli. The identification of stressors and early intervention enable the delay of the functional capacity decline. In practice, the planning of interventions that depend on the innate capacity of older adults is of utmost importance. Conclusion: The trajectory outlined over a debilitating event is relevant to understand the factors that contribute to the development of frailty or pre-frailty conditions. This knowledge allows nurses to adjust their practice and contribute to the effectiveness of interventions and a better prevention of the frailty syndrome.
