AbstractAim and objectivesTo assess intensive care nurses' resilience and identify associated personal factors and physical activity behaviours using a job demands–recovery framework.BackgroundCurrently, there is inconsistent evidence as to whether nurse resilience is associated with personal factors or with physical activity at work or during leisure time.DesignA cross‐sectional study was conducted with nurses from four intensive care units in Auckland, New Zealand.MethodsAn online survey was conducted to collect nurses' personal information and assess their resilience levels using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale 25. Participants were nurses working at least 32 hr fortnightly and providing direct patient care. Physical activity was objectively measured using a pair of accelerometers worn on the back and thigh over four consecutive days (two workdays followed by two nonworkdays). Bivariable and multivariable regression were used to identify personal factors and physical activity behaviours associated with resilience (followed the STROBE checklist).ResultsA total of 93 nurses were included in the study. The participants' average resilience level was low. Resilience was positively associated with the objectively measured physical job demands factors: occupational physical activity, moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity at work and dynamic standing at work. Resilience was negatively associated with one objectively measured recovery factor: sleep during leisure time. In multivariable modelling, being married and moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity at work were positively associated with resilience, while not having religious beliefs and sleep during leisure time were negatively associated with resilience.ConclusionsResilient nurses have a greater tolerance to high physical activity at work and lower sleep duration during leisure time. Strategies are needed to improve intensive care nurses' resilience levels.Relevance to clinical practiceResults may help managers gain a better understanding of the ICU nurses' characteristics associated with resilience, leading them to develop strategies for improving ICU nurse resilience.
