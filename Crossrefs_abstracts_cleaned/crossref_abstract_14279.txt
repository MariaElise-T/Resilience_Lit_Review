Bangladeshâ€™s deltaic geography makes it highly subject to natural disasters, with the southwest region being especially vulnerable to cyclones, storm surges, waterlogging during the monsoon, and soil salinity during the dry season. Despite being primarily an agricultural country, frequent natural disasters have severely impacted crop production and biodiversity, making it difficult for small coastal farmers to earn a livelihood. This study sought to identify the various income-generating activities and effective strategies that could help the waterlogged community become more resilient to the challenges posed by climate change. A mixed method, including a household survey, field visit, in-depth interview, and key informant interview, was used to collect data based on the purposive sampling technique. The collected quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using percentage measures and narrative processes, respectively, and interpreted in the socio-cultural context to give a specific form and basis to the study. The study revealed that marginal farmers in Malopara village are particularly vulnerable to biodiversity losses that threaten their lives and livelihoods. To address these challenges, the study also found multiple income-generating activities as a way of community-based adaptation. This approach would help reduce food insecurity and provide alternative sources of income for small farmers, who are most affected by the changing climate.
