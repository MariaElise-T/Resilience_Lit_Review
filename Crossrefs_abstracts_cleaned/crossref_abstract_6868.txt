AbstractThe resilience of a network is the expected number of pairs of nodes that can communicate. Computing the resilience of a network is a #P‐complete problem even for planar networks with fail‐safe nodes. We generalize an O(n2) time algorithm to compute the resilience of n‐node k‐tree networks with fail‐safe nodes to obtain an O(n) time algorithm that computes the resilience of n‐node partial k‐tree networks with edge and node failures (given a fixed k and an embedding of the partial k‐tree in a k‐tree).
