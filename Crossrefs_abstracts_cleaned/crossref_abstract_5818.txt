Clarence and Elise Stolte farm the family Masterton property as 50:50 sharemilkers. They have made the 285 ha dairy farming business resilient to environmental and milk price volatility by remaining focussed on sustainable results and not productivity. Evidenced through the Dairy Systems Monitoring (DSM) and the Dairy Farm Business of the Year competition they stand in the top 10% of elite groups for financial results in both high payout in a high pasture yield season, and then in the following low payout, low pasture yield season. Being able to demonstrate consistent results comes from a deliberately well considered farm policy, skilled on-farm management, maximising home grown feed yields and strong discipline around the farm budget.
