IntroductionPrevious studies have yet to reach a consensus on the construct of resilience perception, and how to enhance the effect of resilience intervention remains an urgent issue. In this consideration, this study examines the fundamental construct of resilience. It provides insight into the critical prevention goal for resilience intervention by utilizing the latest methods of psychological network analysis.MethodsThe sample is the graduate students enrolled in September 2021. Participants completed (1) the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, (2) the University of Washington Resilience Scale-8 Item, (3) the Brief Resilience Scale, and (4) the Resilience Scale for Adults, each representing different orientations of resilience.ResultsThe network analysis grants greater clarity to the resilience perception as a dynamic system that interacts between an individual's tendency to intrinsic capacity and response to external resources. This study has shown that a positive perception of external social resources is the most important for individuals' resilience cognition; the effect of resilience intervention can be achieved more quickly by changing the individual's sense of hope.DiscussionBased on the results, a psychometric instrument that integrates different orientations of resilience concepts and is based on time-varying needs to be developed.
