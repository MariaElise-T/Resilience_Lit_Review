Purpose This study assesses disruption risk management and resilience capabilities from the perspective of top-level operations and supply chain managers when faced with COVID-19 disruptions.Design/methodology/approach The study involves qualitative research via a triple-phase, interview-based method, following an interpretivist philosophy embodying an empathetic, subjective view to interpret the perspective of top-level managers. The data has been coded and analysed thematically.Findings Based on the ability to adapt to changing and uncertain environments using quick decision-making, technology and access to resources, the findings show a level of resilience adequate to withstand risk disruptions. The data do not expose differences between disruption management and traditional risk management but do display potential for businesses to adopt a disruption-oriented supply network that is flexible.Research limitations/implications Currently, there are little data concerning COVID-19 disruption risk, and the propagation of these impacts throughout the supply chain. This study is limited to the perspective of top, senior-level managers in supply chain and operations.Practical implications The research signifies that by adopting a disruption-oriented, flexible network, business may have the means to overcome and surpass impacts from disruption risks. The study offers knowledge on supply chain resilience and flexibility in times of crisis. Managers and practitioners might adopt the evidence to support in developing strategies towards building resilient supply chains.Originality/value The findings and conclusions of this paper are the product of the authorsâ€™ own work, and the research has been supported appropriately through academic contributions in the study area.
