Objective: This study aimed to find the association among body image focused social media usage (BSMU), resilience, attachment, and eating-related problems among Thai adolescents.
Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive research was conducted with a sample of 495 high school students from three schools in Bangkok. The participants answered an online questionnaire comprised of age, sex, height/weight, BSMU, Body-esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults, Eating Attitudes Test, Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment for Children, and the Thai Resilience Quotient. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic information, body satisfaction, resilience, attachment, and eating-related problems. T-tests, chi-square, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the associations between these variables.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 17.06 (0.805), with 307 female participants (62%). Time spent on social media was found to be associated with increased risk of binging (AOR (CI) = 1.71 (1.14-2.56)). BSMU was associated with increased risk of inappropriate eating attitudes, binging, purging and using laxative (AOR (CI) = 1.14 (1.03-1.27), 1.14 (1.06-1.22), 1.20 (1.04-1.40), and 1.21 (1.09-1.34) respectively). Higher resilience was found to associated with lower risk in binging (AOR (CI) = 0.45 (0.21-0.97)). However, attachment is not associated with any of eating-related problems.
Conclusion: BSMU usage was associated with inappropriate eating attitudes and behavior. Findings also suggest that higher resilience and stronger attachment were Â associated with lower risk of eating-related problems. The effectiveness of resilience and attachment improvement programs should be explored to help protect against eating problems.
