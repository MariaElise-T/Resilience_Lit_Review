Enterprise resilience is a key capacity to guarantee enterprisesâ€™ long-term continuity. This paper proposes a quantitative approach to enhance enterprise resilience by selecting optimal preventive actions to be activated to cushion the impact of disruptive events and to improve preparedness capability, one of the pillars of the enterprise resilience capacity. The proposed algorithms combine the dynamic programming approach with attenuation formulas to model real improvements when a combined set of preventive actions is activated for the same disruptive event. A numerical example is presented that shows remarkable reductions in the expected annual cost due to potential disruptive events.
