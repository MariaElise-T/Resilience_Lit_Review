With the large-scale wind power integration, power systems have to address not only the conventional power demand fluctuations but also the wind uncertainty. To improve the economical effectiveness, resilience, and environmental protection of power systems in the source-load uncertainty, a real-time low-carbon scheduling for the wind–thermal–hydro-storage integrated system is proposed. The power imbalance caused by the uncertainty is neutralized by the synergetic linear decision of multiple resources. To address the source-load uncertainty, a stochastic robust optimization is introduced, which establishes the system constraints by robust optimization for the resilience operation, while optimizing the expected operation cost in the empirical uncertainty distribution for economic efficiency. Moreover, a multi-point estimation is applied to formulate the expected operation cost precisely and quickly. By using the dual theory, the proposed real-time power scheduling is derived as a mixed integer bilinear constrained programming. A multi-step sequential convexified solution is developed to solve the complex scheduling problem, which linearizes the bilinear constraints with alternate optimization and relaxes the state variables of energy storages with an “estimation–correction” strategy. Finally, case studies show the superiority of the proposed scheduling method and convexified solution.
