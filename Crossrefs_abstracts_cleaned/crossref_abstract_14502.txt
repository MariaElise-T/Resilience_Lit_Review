Resilient, stable, and productive forage systems are needed to endure increasingly frequent climatic extremes. Resilience is the ability of a forage system to withstand a climatic crisis with high yields, stability is the minimal variability of yields across normal years, and productivity is the average yield across normal years. The goal of this research was to quantify resilience, stability, and productivity of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars to identify superior ones. Forage yield means from alfalfa cultivar trials from 11 US states and one Canadian province over 19 yr (1995â€“2013) were analyzed using linear mixed models. Locations with an extreme crisis year were identified, and quantitative measures for resilience and stability for each cultivar were calculated. Productivity, stability, and resilience were different among cultivars across locations, showing that some cultivars were consistently superior for each variable. Cultivar stability was not associated with productivity, and it was negatively associated with disease resistance. Cultivar resilience was negatively associated with productivity, and not associated with other traits. Cultivar productivity has increased with year of release of cultivar, stability has not changed, and resilience has decreased. Therefore, stability and resilience are different dimensions, explained by different traits. A coordinated evaluation effort across locations is needed to test and improve cultivar resilience in the future, and develop alfalfa cultivars more profitable for the long term.
