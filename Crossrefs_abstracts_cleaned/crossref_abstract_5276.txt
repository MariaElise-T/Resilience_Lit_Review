Urban floods can threaten citizens’ quality of life, produce socioeconomic losses, and act as an urban degradation driver. Restoring urban rivers, however, is not simple and its results are usually limited. It would be desirable to enhance urban fluvial systems, control flood risks, and increase city resilience while improving the city itself. This work suggests that river restoration, when applied to an urban watershed, should be supported by sustainable urban drainage measures to compensate for the negative effects induced by city growth in the water cycle, in a systemic approach to the entire watershed. A methodological framework is proposed to verify this hypothesis intending to assess urban flooding projects in a wide sense. This framework uses a hydrodynamic mathematical model and a set of multicriteria indices. A case study in Dona Eugênia Watershed, in Brazil, was developed. Two different design concepts were considered: the usual drainage design and the river restoration combined with sustainable urban drainage. Both solutions were designed to completely solve the problems, leading to virtually zero flooding in the present situation; however, environmental and urban gains were greater when using the proposed combination. Besides, when testing resilience behavior, it was also shown to be more consistent over time.
