Severe natural events leading to wide and intense impacts on power systems are becoming more and more frequent due to climate changes. Operators are urged to set up plans to assess the possible consequences of such events, in view of counteracting them. To this aim, the application of the resilience concept can be beneficial. The paper describes a methodology for power system resilience assessment and enhancement, aimed at quantifying both system resilience indicators evaluated for severe threats, and the benefits to resilience brought by operational and grid hardening measures. The capabilities of the methodology are demonstrated on real study cases.
