 Resilience in women older than age 85 is defined as the response of rebound and improvement in function after devastating illness. Using a snowball recruitment method, 7 women from a midwestern U.S. city participated (mean age = 88.625 years), representing various ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Responses from these women related to resilience after illness late in life included their experiences with frailty, determination to overcome adversity, previous experience with hardship, ability to access care, cultural influences, family support, caring for self, caring for others, and descriptions of functioning similar to an efficient machine. Further research is needed to explore resilience in older women; however, specific nursing interventions are suggested related to these themes.
