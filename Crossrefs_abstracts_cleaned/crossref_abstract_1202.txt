 Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a pilot mindfulness intervention program, the Emergency Resiliency Initiative (ERI), as well as to investigate changes in burnout scores and key drivers to burnout among registered nurses (RNs) and patient care technicians (PCTs) in a Level 1 trauma center emergency department (ED). Design: A mixed methods pre/post study with data collection points before and after the 3-month intervention. Method: Three mindfulness educational/experiential sessions were delivered once a month at staff meetings with topic themes of Introduction to Mindfulness, Practical Applications of Mindfulness, and Cultivating Compassion. Participants were asked to complete a minimum of two weekly 5-minute meditations. Burnout scores were assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory at preintervention (baseline) and postintervention. Findings: From the pre- ( n = 35) to post- ( n = 26) intervention period there was a significant increase in personal accomplishment scores ( p = .01) and decrease in emotional exhaustion scores ( p = .03) for RNs and PCTs combined. Qualitative interviews revealed five burnout-related themes: (a) prioritization distress, (b) change fatigue, (c) self-protection through superficiality, (d) intentional response, and (e) community amid chaos. Conclusion: The ERI was a feasible and acceptable program associated with improvements in burnout scores. Qualitative interviews revealed the positive impacts of mindfulness on ED clinician resiliency and identified future opportunities to address burnout from a holistic perspective.
