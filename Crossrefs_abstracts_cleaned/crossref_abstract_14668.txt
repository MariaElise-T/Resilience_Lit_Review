The results of this study identified 15 customer needs and obtained 3 priority customer needs, namely no errors on invoices and B/L, professional shipping services and easy and realtime tracking of goods shipments. 18 risks have been identified and 3 risk priorities have been obtained, namely damage to communication devices, handling errors and delays in handling documents or goods by EMKL. 26 causes of risk have been identified and 3 priority causes of risk have been identified, namely lack of skill and accuracy of employees, server disruption and lack of work motivation in employees. Based on the analysis that has been carried out in the previous sections, there are 18 resilience measures as risk mitigation that can be carried out by companies. The following are the top-ranked resilience measures, including providing training on sending and receiving goods, establishing good communication with customers and providing training on how to communicate well.
