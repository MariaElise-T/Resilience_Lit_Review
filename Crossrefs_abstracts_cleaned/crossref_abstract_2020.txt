The term “resilience” originated in environmental studies and describes the biological capacity to adapt and thrive under adverse environmental conditions. Regional economic resilience is defined as the capacity of a territory’s economy to resist and/or recover quickly from external shocks, even improving its situation from the pre-shock status. This editorial introduction provides a summary of the eleven contributions included in the special issue on regions and economic resilience. These eleven articles focus on different channels related to processes of mitigation (resistance-recovery) and adaptive resilience (reorientation-renewal) in a wide variety of geographical settings and scales. They include methodological advances and also relevant results from a policy perspective. The editorial concludes by providing some directions for future research.
