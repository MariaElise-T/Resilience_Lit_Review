AbstractIn this paper, the finite‐time adaptive resilient control problem for a class of switched nonlinear systems with deception attacks by using the dynamic surface control (DSC) strategy is addressed. A more general class of uncertain nonstrict‐feedback switched nonlinear systems with the sensor and actuator deception attacks are considered. Deception attacks can damage sensor, control and switching data, which results in the switching signal and the finite‐time control gains unknown, meanwhile the conventional dynamic surface errors inacessible. To overcome the difficulty, first, the approximation technique of neural networks (NNs) is used to deal with the unknown nonlinear terms and compensate the sensor and actuator deception attacks. Secondly, a new coordinate transformation and a novel switched adaptive finite‐time filter are designed to mitigate the effects caused by the sensor attacks and avoid the problem of “explosion of complexity”. Thirdly, Nussbaum technology is exploited to handle the unknown finite‐time control gains problem caused by deception attacks. Then, by the proposed control strategy, the practical finite‐time stability analysis is presented. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed control method.
