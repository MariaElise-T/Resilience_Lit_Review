We present a simple, robust, ad hoc forwarding scheme for small-footprint, low-cost wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and discuss some of its features from the viewpoint of resilience. The class of applications shaping the resilience requirements for our discussion covers temporary, and possibly disposable deployments of potentially massive populations of sensing nodes to assist in the management of emergency missions, including the management of the effects from natural or man-made disasters. Our goal is to make the network resistant to failures of any of its fragments, which may result from the networkâ€™s intended modus operandi or from intentional malicious attempts at crippling its function, while keeping the cost and footprint of the devices at the absolute minimum.
