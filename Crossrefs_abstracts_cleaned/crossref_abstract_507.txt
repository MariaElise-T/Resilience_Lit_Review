Nurse residents are at greater risk of compassion fatigue compared to more experienced nurses.Â  The amended 2015 Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education Standards of Entry-To-Practice Accreditation of Nurse Residency Programs require that residency programs include approaches to prevent compassion fatigue in their education experiences. This manuscript reports 6-month follow-up results of a longitudinal study in new graduate nurses that evaluated the influence of a four-hour resiliency intervention for compassion fatigue in two hospitals with nurse residency programs within an academic medical center system. We previously reported a statistically significant decrease in mean STS from baseline to 2-months (p < .001). Using a paired t-test, compassion satisfaction (CS) and the two elements of compassion fatigue (CF), secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout (BO), were measured against 6-month post-intervention. Prevalence and changes in mean scores were reported, suggesting that the results found at 2-month follow-up (n = 94) were sustained at 6-month follow-up (n = 34). The mean STS showed a statistically significant decrease from 2-months and 6-months (p < .001). A decrease in BO and mean increase in CS were not statistically significant, but were trending in a positive direction. As theorized, both STS and BO decreased from baseline to 2-months and 6-months after the-intervention, and CS increased. These results indicate that early compassion fatigue resiliency education may be helpful in increasing CS and lowering the symptoms of CF in nurse residents.
