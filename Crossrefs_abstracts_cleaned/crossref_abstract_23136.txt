 Balloon-type cross-laminated timber coupled-wall (CLT-CW) structure is an emerging and sustainable option for constructing tall timber buildings. The structure features buckling restrained brace (BRB) hold-downs, balloon-type CLT walls, and coupling beams with replaceable shear links. This study investigates the probabilistic seismic performance (including economic loss, downtime, and resilience index) of a 20-story CLT-CW building. A three-dimensional (3D) structural model is developed to perform incremental dynamic analysis using 30 pairs of ground motion records that represent the seismicity of Vancouver, Canada. Intensity- and time-based loss assessments are conducted to estimate probability distributions of seismic losses according to the FEMA P-58 methodology. Post-earthquake recovery trajectories of the housing function are also presented to calculate the seismic resilience indices under different intensities. The results reveal that the coupling beams contribute the most to repair cost among all structural components. In light of the replaceability and energy dissipating role of coupling beams, the efficiency and resiliency of the CLT-CW building are validated.
