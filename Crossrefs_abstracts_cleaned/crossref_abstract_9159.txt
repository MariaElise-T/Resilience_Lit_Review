Research on technology-assisted crisis management have been centered on tools to assist the response phase of a disaster. Through a semantic network analysis of concept relations in the titles of the publications, the authors found that many theoretical tools exist for disaster management but have not been operationalized to take a holistic approach toward technology for resilience. There is a lack of emphasis on the design of information and communication technologies, besides geographical information systems, to assist other phases of the crisis management cycle, particularly the preparedness and mitigation phases for resilience. By operationalizing the MOVE framework in a case study, the authors discover factors critical to the design of informatics and visualization tools to support resilience. This study concludes with a conceptual design framework “Digital Crow's Nest” to show feasibility of technology design for disaster resilience analytics using open data sources.
