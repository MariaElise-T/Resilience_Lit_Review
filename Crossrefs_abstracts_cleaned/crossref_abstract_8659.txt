AbstractResilience states an individual’s ability to survive and can adapt to stressful situations. The growth of mathematical resilience in each requires minimal intelligence at an average level; this is because mathematical resilience is closely related to the ability to understand and convey something through the right language, reading ability, and non-verbal communication. This study aims to analyze differences in learning outcomes between students who are lecturing using blended learning models and conventional, analyzing students’ mathematical resilience abilities both as a whole and based on high and low ability levels in the Linear Program subject. The population of this research activity includes fourth-semester students, Mathematics Education Study Program, Unswagati Cirebon Teaching Education Faculty 2017-2018 academic year. The sample of the study is class A and B of 46 students. The study design used a quasi-experimental type with a non-equivalent control group. The research design chosen was a static group comparison experimental design involving two groups. The results showed that the ability of mathematical resilience by using blended learning, both overall and upper and lower groups had a significant increase.
