AbstractProgrammed cell death (PCD) is one of the most intensively researched fields in modern mammalian biology with roles in cancer, aging, diabetes and numerous neurodegenerative diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that PCD also plays significant roles in plant defence and responses to the environment. Given their unique ability to tolerate desiccation (cells remain viable even after theyâ€™ve lost 95% of their water), resurrection plants make ideal models to study the regulation of plant PCD pathways. Previously, we showed that the Australian resurrection plant, Tripogon loliiformis, suppresses plant PCD, via trehalose-mediated activation of autophagy pathways, during drying. In the present study, we created a full-length T. loliiformis cDNA library, performed a large-scale Agrobacterium screen for improved salinity tolerance and identified Stachyose synthase (TlStach) as a potential candidate for improving stress tolerance. Tripogon loliiformis shoots accumulate stachyose synthase transcripts and stachyose during drying. Attempts to generate transgenic plants expressing TlStach failed and were consistent with previous reports in mammals that demonstrated stachyose-mediated induction of apoptosis. Using a combination of transcriptomics, metabolomics and cell death assays (TUNNEL and DNA laddering), we investigated whether stachyose induces apoptotic-like cell death in T. loliiformis. We show that stachyose triggers the formation of the hallmarks of plant apoptotic-like cell death in the desiccation sensitive Nicotiana benthamiana but not the resilient T. loliiformis. These findings suggest that T. loliiformis suppresses stachyose-mediated apoptotic-like cell death and provides insights on the role of sugar metabolism and plant PCD pathways. A better understanding of how resilient plants regulate sugar metabolism and PCD pathways may facilitate future targeting of plant metabolic pathways for increased stress tolerance.
