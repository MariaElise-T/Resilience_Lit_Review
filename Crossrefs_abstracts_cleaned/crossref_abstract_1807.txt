This study investigated self‐regulation and resiliency in one's search for reemployment. Although trait‐based approaches are central to many resiliency conceptualizations, recent research has found that self‐regulation (affective, behavioral, and cognitive) contributes to predicting resiliency‐related outcomes. We hypothesized that self‐regulation would incrementally predict reemployment process outcomes, specifically the job search outcomes of psychological well‐being, job search self‐efficacy, and job search clarity. Results indicated that, over and above resiliency traits, behavioral and cognitive self‐regulation incrementally predicted well‐being and job search clarity, and cognitive self‐regulation incrementally predicted job search self‐efficacy. Implications for theory and continued research on resiliency in reemployment are discussed.
