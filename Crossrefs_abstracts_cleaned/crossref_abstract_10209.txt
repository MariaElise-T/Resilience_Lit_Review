AbstractAusterity policies have affected local government for over a decade challenging their financial resilience to cope with further financial shocks. Using a financial resilience framework, this paper examines whether lower tier authorities behave in the same way as their higher tier counterparts when it comes to financial resilience to shocks. From a detailed field study of three lower tier (district) authorities in English local government, it is concluded that they do not have the capacity to ‘Bounce Forwards’. They can only ‘Bounce Back’ in the short term and even that is becoming increasingly difficult.
