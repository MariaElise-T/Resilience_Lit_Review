AbstractThe recent increase in the frequency and intensity of disasters has damaged and disrupted transportation infrastructures, thereby significantly increasing the economic losses and slowing the pace of recovery. Resilient infrastructures ensure functionality with minimal discontinuity, but there currently exists rarely a tool for assessing the resilience level of existing transportation infrastructures so that the information can be used to make future constructions more resilient. This study aims to identify the significant dimensions for measuring the resilience of transportation infrastructures and to utilize the dimensions to develop a decision-making tool that can be used to assess the level of resilience. A survey supported by a comprehensive literature review was conducted, and statistical tests were performed on the collected data. It was found that network characteristics (length of the link, number of lanes, number of optional routes, etc.), organizational characteristics (time to start reconstruction work, knowledge of the employee, resilience measurement experience, etc.), and information related to data (previous data availability and data accessibility, etc.) have major impacts on the resilience of transportation infrastructures. Based on the impact of statistically significant indicators, a resilience measurement tool was developed that provides a relative resilience score for projects and reveals how each statistically significant dimension affects the resilience. The outcome of this study will help decision-makers and practitioners prioritize their projects for resilience enhancement activities and provide funding accordingly.
