AbstractObjectiveThere is a growing demand for interpreters in the cancer setting. Interpreters, the link to quality care for limited English proficiency patients, face many psychosocial stressors in their work. This project assessed interpreters' experiences of stress and piloted a resiliency program to help interpreters cope with stressors.MethodsFrom 2013 to 2014, we pilot tested a targeted resiliency program with interpreters from three Boston‐based hospitals. In Phase 1, we conducted five focus groups (n = 31) to identify interpreters' psychosocial needs. In Phase 2, we developed and tested a 4‐h group program with 29 interpreters (response rate = 90%; 69% female, 54% Hispanic, 85% born outside of the U.S.).ResultsPhase 1. Stressors were patient‐based (seeing young patients decline), interactions with medical team (unsure of role), and systems‐based (appointment unpredictability). Phase 2. At baseline interpreters reported low abilities to cope with stress (measured by the Measure of Current Status (MOCS‐A)). At 4‐week follow‐up we found improvements in job satisfaction (p = .02; Cohen's d = .41) and declines in sick days (p = .08; Cohen's d = .38). Stress reactivity (MOCS‐A) improved; specifically participants reported feeling more assertive about their needs (p = .10; Cohen's d = .30) and more able to relax at will (p = .10; Cohen's d = .35)—important mechanisms to lower distress.ConclusionsWe piloted a resiliency program for medical interpreters in cancer care. We found that interpreters experience distress and have low coping skills. This program resulted in improved work factors and stress reactivity. Future research should include further implementation and testing in a larger, randomized trial.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
