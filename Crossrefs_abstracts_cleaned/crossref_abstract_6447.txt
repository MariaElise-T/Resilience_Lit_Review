 Cities, particularly in the global south, face numerous challenges in responding to a rapidly growing population. Ensuring the wellbeing of urban dwellers, particularly in the face of known natural hazards and an increasingly unpredictable climate, is leading cities to take resilience-based approaches to meet these challenges. Arup and Engineers Without Borders UK hosted a competition to unearth perspectives from the next generation of urban professionals on what resilient cities might look like. From the top ten shortlisted posters, the key messages emerging were: (a) building urban resilience requires action and systemic change across all four key components of an urban system – infrastructure, institutions, knowledge, and ecosystems; (b) resilient cities are the result of multiple interventions including transport and energy, food security, urban planning and waste management; (c) resilience is not location specific and is distinct from disaster risk reduction; and (d) building resilience is a progressive and evolving process of urban development – more practical examples are needed to help visualise it.
