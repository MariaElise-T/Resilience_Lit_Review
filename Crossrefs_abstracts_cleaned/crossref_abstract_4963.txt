Decision support systems provide vital benefits supplying additional information before planning in disaster management. To improve a city's resilience against disasters such organization and maintenance must be conducted during the city planning stage. In this work, an improvement suggestion mechanism is built using risk value estimation through availability of emergency centers and road network redundancy is provided. This approach investigates the study area to determine possible risk zones within the city using routing and road network analysis. Upon investigation of the necessary parameters, a risk value is calculated for each administrative division within a city. These risk values are then passed to the decision support stage in which the system can pick one or several items from a list of improvements to reduce overall riskiness of these divisions. This work combines several ideas of emergency management domain in a formula to provide a quantitative meaning to possible risk within administrative divisions. Decision support aspect can be customized further to help planners have a preliminary analysis by showing the optimal locations to place new emergency management facilities.
