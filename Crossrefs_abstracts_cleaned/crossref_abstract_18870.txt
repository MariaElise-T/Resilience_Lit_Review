 Resilience is a multidisciplinary concept that deals with rapid response and recovery of a system experiencing a disruption. Despite extensive research on this topic, there is a need to clarify resilience concepts in the context of road freight transportation systems (FTSs) from a three-dimensional perspective (i.e., physical infrastructure, users, and managing organizations) and to identify persistent knowledge gaps concerning the characterization and measurement of FTS resilience vis-Ã -vis disruptive events. This paper addresses these shortcomings through a systematic review of 149 research studies. The synthesis of findings clarifies inconsistencies associated with the characteristics of FTS resilience and in so doing, establishes a unified framework for measuring FTS resilience through the life cycle of disruptive events. Critical data gaps, methodological shortcomings, and a lack of empirical evidence concerning FTS resilience to disruptive events remain. More robust analytical approaches are required to incorporate interdependencies among FTS dimensions into resilience assessments.
