Background and Objectives: Emergency medical technicians (EMTs), as the front line of dealing with patients with COVID-19, are exposed to the intensification of stress caused by these conditions, and it is essential to identify related factors, such as resilience and spiritual intelligence in this context. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between perceived stress, spiritual intelligence, and resilience of EMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 108 EMTs in Shahroud in 2021. Data collection tools included the demographic checklist, Cohen’s perceived stress questionnaire, King’s spiritual intelligence questionnaire, and Conrad Davidson’s questionnaire (CD-RISC). To analyze the data, descriptive and inferential (independent t-test, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression) statistics were used. Results: The mean scores of perceived stress and resilience of employees were at medium and high levels, respectively. There was no significant relationship between perceived stress and spiritual intelligence (r=-0.49, P=0.24), but there was a meaningful negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience (r=-0.31, P=0.002). A positive and significant relationship was observed between perceived stress score and age and work experience. Conclusion: Considering the significant relationship between perceived stress and resilience in the present study, it is suggested that the administrators provide solutions such as creating training courses to manage stress and increase resilience in EMTs.
