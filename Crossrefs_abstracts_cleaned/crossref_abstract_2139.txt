Purpose of the article: development of tools for building the cyber resilient platform for Internet of things (IIoT/IoT). The urgency of development the cyber resilient platform for Internet of things (IIoT/IoT) is to provide the required security and resilience of critical information infrastructure of the Russian Federation in the face of rising security threats, and imperfection of the known models, methods and means for data collection and processing in IIoT/IoT networks, based on the wireless technology Sigfox, LoRaWaN, “Strij/”Vaviot” (XNB/Nb-Fi), NBIoT. Research methods: It uses the author’s models and methods of similarity and dimensions theory of the distributed computing, as well as the domestic technology of wireless communication Logic Inter Node Connection (LINC) (http:// aura360.ru/), as well as the domestic FenixOS operating system (https://fenix.link/kontakty/), designed for collecting and processing the telemetry data. Results: Developed tools for building the cyber resilient platform for Internet of things (IIoT/IoT). The article presents the main scientific and technical results of solving this problem. The research was carried out within the framework of the Federal project “Information security” of the national program “Digital economy of the Russian Federation”. It is important to note that the results allowed designing a prototype of the domestic Internet of things (IIoT/IoT) platform with self-healing data reception and transmission paths between smart devices
