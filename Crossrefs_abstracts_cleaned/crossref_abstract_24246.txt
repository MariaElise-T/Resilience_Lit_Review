The objective of this study is to determine family functionality and resilience in adolescents from a vulnerable educational institution in Lima. It is a quantitative, descriptive, correlational study, with a population of 571 adolescents who answered a questionnaire of sociodemographic data, and the family APGAR scales and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) that will allow observing family functionality and resilience. In the results, we observe that in adolescents with severe family dysfunction, 157 (51.8%) have low resilience, in moderate family dysfunction, 155 (100%) have medium resilience, in mild family dysfunction, 5 (100%) have high resilience and with good family function, 108 (100%) have high resilience. Therefore, it is concluded that the family should be intervened to identify possible risk factors that harm the adolescent in the development of their capacities.
