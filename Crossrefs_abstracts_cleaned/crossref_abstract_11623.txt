Abstract
Resilience building commonly focuses on attributes such as redundancy. Whilst this may be effective in some cases, provision of specific attributes does not guarantee resilient performance and research is required to determine the suitability of such approaches. This study uses 250 combined sewer system virtual case studies to explore the effects of two attribute-based interventions (increasing distributed storage and reducing imperviousness) on performance-based resilience measures. These are found to provide improvement in performance under system failure in the majority of case studies, but it is also shown that attribute-based intervention development can result in reduced resilience.
