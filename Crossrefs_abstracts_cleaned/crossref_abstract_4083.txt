AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic, caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2, has presented itself as a wicked problem where both the disease and its containment measures have caused significant human suffering. The pandemic has also affected every aspect of aquaculture and capture fisheries. Zoonotic origin of the SARS‐CoV‐2 and its containment measures, such as restrictions on the mobility of people, social distancing and ban on public gathering, have disrupted fish production, supply chain, consumer behaviour and perception for fish as a food item. The debilitating effect of COVID‐19 on the global economy has also left people with less dispensable income, which can translate to poor fish sales in the upcoming years. Therefore, the effects of COVID‐19 on society are not only a medical issue but have more profound and long‐lasting socioeconomic consequences. The current article reviews the existing literature across multiple disciplines to determine the effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic on multiple aspects of the aquaculture and fishing industry; aquaculture and capture fishery, post‐harvest processing of fish, supply chain and consumer behaviour. The article also provides recommendations for making different aspects of aquaculture and fisheries resilient to a future pandemic‐like situation. The recommendations are inspired by the principles of One Health that range from biological to socioeconomic aspects of the sector. A One Health approach is a collaborative effort from professionals belonging, but not limited, to the disciplines of medicine, veterinary, environment, economics, education and social sciences to make policy‐level interventions for problems that can be difficult to address using conventional approach.
