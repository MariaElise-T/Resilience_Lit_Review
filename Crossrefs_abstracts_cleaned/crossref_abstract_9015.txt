The United Nations Agenda 2030 for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires a concrete approach for effective implementation of SDGs as these global goals provide a blueprint to achieve a prosperous, better, and more sustainable future. However, SDG-11 – sustainable cities and communities – holds an imperative place among all the seventeen goals as it targets social, economic, and ecological sustainability and development, and this can be achieved through building community resilience. Resilience is the capacity to prevent, mitigate, absorb, and adapt in pre and post-disaster or crises, and a resilient community – having all the said capacities and capabilities – can sustain any kind of uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to highlight the significance of resilience in making cities and communities sustainable and to identify the possible outcomes of embedding the four indicators of resilience – healthy and active community resources, elevated priority to lifeline functions, resilience measurement and risk management, and partnership and executive management – in the development framework and policy structure of Pakistan. The findings and results have been supported through past pieces of literature such as research papers, annual reports, project documents, journal articles, websites, policy frameworks, and other documents on SDGs, resilience building, community resilience, and the importance of resilience in achieving SDG-11. The findings reveal that integrating the four indicators of resilience can increase risk knowledge at the local level to make the public well-prepared, enhance connectedness and cohesion to make healthy community networks, ensure availability and fair distribution of community resources and lifeline functions, and create an appropriate governing structure for effective and expeditious execution of policies and strategies.
