 Emotional resilience may be seen as the ability of an individual to cope with adversities and bounce back from failures. Emotional resilience requires a high degree of self-awareness, strong self-regulation and a host of other attributes. Factors like stress, burnout, lack of social support and negative thinking are enemies of emotional resilience. Most of the existing models of emotional resilience deal with children, adolescents, the armed forces or patients. They do not take into account factors affecting emotional resilience of an adult in general. This article aims to study the concept of emotional resilience in adults, analyse key factors affecting the same and propose a new theoretical model of emotional resilience for adults. In addition, based on the literature and experiential knowledge of the authors, this article seeks to develop 12 propositions based on the antecedents of emotional resilience in adults.
