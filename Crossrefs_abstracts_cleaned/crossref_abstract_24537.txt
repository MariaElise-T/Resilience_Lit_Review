Significance
Depression is the most common and debilitating psychiatric disorder in the world. However, the precise mechanisms underlying depression remain largely unknown. Recent evidence suggests that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) plays a key role in inflammation, which is involved in depression. The sEH inhibitor, TPPU, showed antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. Expression of sEH protein was increased in the brain of chronically stressed (susceptible) mice and depressed patients. Prophylactic sEH inhibition or sEH-KO resulted in resilience to repeated social defeat stress, associated with increased BDNF-TrkB signaling in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of KO mice. This study shows that sEH plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression, and that its inhibitors could be potential therapeutic drugs for depression.
