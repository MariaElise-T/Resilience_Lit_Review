AbstractThis article addresses the data‐driven resilient platooning control problem for nonlinear vehicular platooning systems with denial‐of‐service attacks. First, the dynamic linearization technique is used for transforming the nonlinear vehicular platooning systems into an equivalent linear data model with robustness. Then, an observer is designed to present the estimation of the pseudo‐partial derivative parameter and a novel model‐free adaptive platooning control (MFAPC) framework is presented by defining a novel vehicular platooning system output. Based on this framework, a novel MFAPC algorithm is designed with an attack compensation mechanism to achieve vehicular platooning control objectives. At last, the effectiveness of the MFAPC algorithm is proved by an example with comparisons.
