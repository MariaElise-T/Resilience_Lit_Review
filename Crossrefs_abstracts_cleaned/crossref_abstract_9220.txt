Objective: The study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and resilience of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Materials and Methods: The data of this descriptive and correlational study are based on the findings of an online survey link created and shared with nurses and nurses’ groups by the researchers between May 22 and 29, 2020, through social media accounts. A personal information form, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Brief Resilience Scale were used to collect data. A total of 401 nurses participated in the study. 
Results: Nurses who have many years of experience and long weekly working hours, who do not have protective equipment, and who provide care for patients with COVID-19, and do not know the precautions to be taken during the care period were found to have high levels of anxiety and low resilience (p < 0.05). There was a low-level significant negative correlation between the nurses’ anxiety and resilience levels (p < 0.05). 
Conclusions: The study proves that the levels of anxiety and resilience in nurses working during the pandemic are affected.
