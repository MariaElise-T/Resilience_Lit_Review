Coordinated fault recovery is essential for the resilience enhancement of integrated electric and heating systems (IEHS) following natural catastrophes as the linkage of the power distribution system (PDS) and district heating system becomes tighter. DHS reconfiguration is a viable method for service restoration because it could adjust the energy between energy sources and achieve uninterrupted energy supplies. In this paper, a collaborative service restoration model considering DHS reconfiguration is proposed to achieve better recovery after natural disasters. DHS reconfiguration could guarantee interrupted power supply in non-fault regions by shifting electric loads between power sources and accomplish optimal service restoration by adjusting the power output of combined heat and power units. Numerous case studies are undertaken to demonstrate the performance of coordinated reconfiguration on resilience enhancement and to confirm the efficacy of the proposed paradigm.
