Excellent human resource development prioritizes organizational performance development elements. Organizational performance in Malaysia&rsquo;s public sector is a concept that still needs to be explored. To date, improvements to leadership quality in order to enhance employee competence is one of the areas of study that has become the focus of researchers in the field of human resource development. In fact, leadership quality is also influenced by a person&rsquo;s self-resilience to changes &ndash; one such example is police officers&rsquo; competence in order to perform their duties well. This study aims to assess the relationship between self-resilience and the leadership qualities of police officers. The study involved the Royal Malaysia Police of the state of Selangor. The study which used a simple randomized quantitative method involved 105 respondents comprised of police officers and other members of the force. Findings of the study indicate highest positive relationships between leadership and competency, resilience and competency, and resilience and leadership, with r values between 0.791 to 0.864. However, the relationship between leadership quality based on education level and length of service (work experience) was not significant. This study shows that there are several elements in human resource development and performance management that can be improved by emphasizing on the leadership aspect in order to improve the competencies of police officers in Malaysia.
