AbstractWe are constantly exposed to the threat of fungal infection. The outcome—clearance, commensalism or infection—depends largely on the ability of our innate immune defences to clear infecting fungal cells versus the success of the fungus in mounting compensatory adaptive responses. As each seeks to gain advantage during these skirmishes, the interactions between host and fungal pathogen are complex and dynamic. Nevertheless, simply compromising the physiological robustness of fungal pathogens reduces their ability to evade antifungal immunity, their virulence, and their tolerance against antifungal therapy. In this article I argue that this physiological robustness is based on a ‘Resilience Network’ which mechanistically links and controls fungal growth, metabolism, stress resistance and drug tolerance. The elasticity of this network probably underlies the phenotypic variability of fungal isolates and the heterogeneity of individual cells within clonal populations. Consequently, I suggest that the definition of the fungal Resilience Network represents an important goal for the future which offers the clear potential to reveal drug targets that compromise drug tolerance and synergise with current antifungal therapies.
