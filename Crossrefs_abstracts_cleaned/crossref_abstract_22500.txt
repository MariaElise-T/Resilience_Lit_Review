Abstract
This desk research delivers an introductory study of village resilience on the western coastline of the Regency of Serang, Province of Banten, Indonesia. It aims to preliminary characterize the level of village resilience to a tsunami hazard. This study utilizes secondary dataset, retrieved from the authorized institutions (statistical bureau and regional government) and accredited news (government bulletin and news agency). It adopts and modifies the four notable methods on resilience analysis, in order to accommodate the relevancy to study areaâ€™s dataset availability. The reformulated method is developed by taking into account the variables of: vulnerability (physical, social, and economical aspects) and capacity (preparedness and mitigation measures) within a village as its unit analysis. Furthermore, SWOT analysis is conducted to present the appropriate recommendations for strengthening the resilience. The study finds that generally, tsunami resilience in study area is still considered inadequate, where among the eleven villages, seven villages set low for the Resilience Index (RI). In regards to this, SWOT analysis assembles a total of fifteen possible strategies and seventeen desk-based recommendations to promote the tsunami-resilient village.
