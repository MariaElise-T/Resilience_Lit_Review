Guided ultrasonic wave localization systems use spatially distributed sensor arrays and wave propagation models to detect and locate damage across a structure. Environmental and operational conditions, such as temperature or stress variations, introduce uncertainty into guided wave data and reduce the effectiveness of these localization systems. These uncertainties cause the models used by each localization algorithm to fail to match with reality. This paper addresses this challenge with an ensemble deep neural network that is trained solely with simulated data. Relative to delay-and-sum and matched field processing strategies, this approach is demonstrated to be more robust to temperature variations in experimental data. As a result, this approach demonstrates superior accuracy with small numbers of sensors and greater resilience to spatially nonhomogeneous temperature variations over time.
