The perceptions of 123 (11 men and 112 women) teacher-trainees regarding the characteristics of moral resilience and moral courage and the linkage between the two were explored using an online questionnaire designed especially for this study. Four themes emerged from the content analysis. (a) The concepts were perceived as embedded in a comprehensive framework encompassing a multifaceted society. (b) Specific factors contribute to the development of moral fiber, which is viewed as the core of resilience. (c) Three linkage patterns were identified between moral resilience and moral courage. (d) The terms were perceived as buzzwords. A clear conceptualization of the notion of moral resilience could facilitate the construction of a process-building model for developing individuals' resilience (the micro level). Thus, teachers with moral resilience would serve as role models in the schools (the meso level), which could then lead to building community-wide resilience (macro-level).
