Under the background of complex domestic and international environment and the trend of urban population agglomeration, the impact of population agglomeration on urban economic resilience is worthy of attention. This paper uses a sample of 284 cities in China to empirically analyze the impact of population agglomeration on urban economic resilience in the context of the 2008 international financial crisis with the help of spatial econometric models. The results are as follows. First, population agglomeration can enhance the city’s resistance to the economic crisis, is more conducive to improving the city’s economic recovery and adjustment ability, and has a positive spatial spillover effect on surrounding cities. Moreover, population agglomeration enhances the economic resilience of urban secondary and tertiary industries. Secondly, in the population agglomeration context, the situation of the labor force structure affects the resilience of the urban economy. In terms of the labor force’s age structure, the agglomeration of prime-age labor is more conducive to improving urban economic resilience than youth and old labor. In terms of labor quality structure, homogeneous human capital agglomeration enhances cities’ resistance to economic crisis, while heterogeneous human capital agglomeration enhances cities’ ability to recover and adjust their economy.
