Background
Pediatric cancer disrupts the lives of siblings in many ways, including physical separations from family and friends that increase risk for distress. Research suggests that siblings use technology and social media to connect with friends and family and seek social support and interaction. However, this may expose siblings to negative online experiences that can erode self-esteem, reducing resilience.


Objective
This study explored the relationship between online experiences, internet-fostered connection, resilience, and psychosocial health among siblings of children with cancer.


Methods
Participants included adolescent siblings (N = 81; aged 12-17 years) of children with cancer. Most were female (56.8%), and 50.6% represented racially or ethnically minoritized groups. Online experiences, social media use, resilience, and psychosocial health were self-reported and analyzed using structural equation modeling.


Results
A majority of siblings reported moderate to severe posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) (59%) and elevated emotional and behavioral difficulties (EBDs) (53%). Experiencing more positive online experiences was associated with greater perceived connection to family and friends online, but not resilience, PTSSs, or EBDs. In contrast, higher negative online experience scores were significantly associated with more PTSSs and EBDs. In addition, the association between negative online experiences and EBDs was significantly mediated by a negative association between negative online experiences and resilience.


Conclusions
Although social media may be a valuable tool for helping siblings of children with cancer garner social support, negative online experiences may be detrimental to their adjustment.


Implications for Practice
Efforts should be made to preserve and foster resilience among siblings who use social media for support.
