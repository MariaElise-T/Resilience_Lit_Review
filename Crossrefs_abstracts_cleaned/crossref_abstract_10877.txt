Photovoice methodology was used to examine and promote body image resilience. Fourteen female college students participated in a 2‚Äêpart group series. Photovoice projects and other artifacts were analyzed. Three themes related to body image resilience emerged from the data analysis: connection, social gender norms, and self. This study contributes to the growing body of literature by examining photovoice as a creative approach for critically discussing body image resilience. Implications for college counselors are provided.
