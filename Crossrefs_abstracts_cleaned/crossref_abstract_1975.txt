AbstractGame changers in public health are traditionally seen as specific in(ter)ventions, but contemporary public health challenges warrant acknowledging complexity instead. Our game changer is a compass to deal with this complexity. In our vision of 2030, system beliefs, goals, structures and events line up to create a society that balances health, climate, social cohesion and economy. To reach this desired system, a resilient public health sector actively interacts with public discourse, political windows of opportunity are seized for institutionalizing health for all policies, and research is intertwined with the policy process, without the merging of the two.
