Due to the increasingly complex and dynamic features of global supply chain networks, it is challenging to provide high supply availability and network connectivity under unexpected disruptions. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the topology resilience of the supply chain network from its multilayer nature. We firstly conduct the study on the connectedness in the supply chain network from a topological perspective and adopt the t-core method to decompose the network into multiple layers. Then, we propose a layer-based rewiring algorithm to recover the network from disruptions. The experimental results in the real supply chain network show that our design greatly improves the network resilience under both random and targeted disruptions.
