This paper presents the potential benefits of nanopolyacrylate (NPA) for the asphalt mixtures used on pavement. This research evaluates the resilient modulus performance of dense graded Superpave-designed HMA mix. Two different types of dense graded Superpave HMA mix were developed consists of unmodified bitumen mix (UMB) and nanopolyacrylate modified bitumen mix (NPMB). Nanopolyacrylate polymer modified bitumen was prepared from addition of 6 percent of NPA polymer into asphalt bitumen. Resilient modulus results from Resilient Modulus test were determined to evaluate the performance of these mixtures. Results showed that all the mixes passed the Superpave volumetric properties criteria which indicated that these mixtures were good with respect to durability and flexibility. The Resilient modulus result of NPMB demonstrates better resistance to rutting than those prepared using UMB mix. It was estimated that the average resilient modulus values for both UMB and NPMB mixtures are decreased by 80 percent when the test temperature increased from 25ºC to 40ºC.   In conclusion, the addition of NPA to the binder has certainly improved the bitumen properties significantly and hence increase the resistant to rutting of the asphalt mixture.
