 The aim of this systematic integrative review was to examine the early impacts of a breast cancer diagnosis (up to 2 years after diagnosis) in relation to quality of life and personal resilience. The bibliographic databases of Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection were searched using predetermined search criteria. Research studies published up to February 2019 were considered and following appraisal 36 articles were included in the review. Younger age, disease progression at first presentation, personality factors such as optimism, and moderators such as social support, clinical interventions and development of self-management abilities predicted better quality of life and personal resilience. Not recovering from the physical and psychological impacts of a new diagnosis has implications for future mental and physical health. This systematic, integrative review highlighted that building resilience and working with women's strengths should be the focus for contemporary clinical interventions for women in the early period after diagnosis of breast cancer.
