AbstractSince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased interest in identifying ways of protecting the mental well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs). Much of this has been directed towards promoting and enhancing the resilience of those deemed as frontline workers. Based on a review of the extant literature, this paper seeks to problematise aspects of how ‘frontline work’ and ‘resilience’ are currently conceptualised. Firstly, frontline work is arbitrarily defined and often narrowly focused on acute, hospital-based settings, leading to the needs of HCWs in other sectors of the healthcare system being overlooked. Secondly, dominant narratives are often underpinned by a reductionist understanding of the concept of resilience, whereby solutions are built around addressing the perceived deficiencies of (frontline) HCWs rather than the structural antecedents of distress. The paper concludes by considering what interventions are appropriate to minimise the risk of burnout across all sectors of the healthcare system in a post-pandemic environment.
