Taking into consideration the current developments as regards the intensification of the 
irregular movement of third country nationals at the EUâ€™s border with Belarus, this paper 
sets as its main objective to assess the resilience building measures that were taken at the 
level of the affected Member States and that of the EU in order to manage the newly 
emerged border crisis. It is being argued that we are not dealing with an ordinary 
migration crisis, but a deliberate act of the Belarusian regime to instrumentalise migrants 
from the Middle East for political purposes. The research presents the facilitation of 
irregular immigration in a dual nexus, firstly as a hybrid warfare tool, and secondly, as a 
shock/stress factor disturbing the system or the prevalent status quo. After presenting the 
statistics on the modification of the illegal border-crossings between Belarus and the EU 
in the 2021-2022 period, we shall attempt to briefly analyse the resilience building 
measures to the hybrid threat of weaponizing migrants that were taken at both Community 
and Member State level, by grouping them in five resilience building categories: 
political/legal, institutional, inter-institutional, regulatory and societal.
