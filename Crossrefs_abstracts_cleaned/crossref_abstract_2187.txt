Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically explore the influence of supply chain information integration (SCII) on supply chain innovativeness (SCI) and supply chain resilience (SCRE).Design/methodology/approach Data from 403 manufacturing companies in Uganda were analyzed using Analysis of Moments of Structures version 27. Unmeasured common latent factors were used to minimize the bias of common methods.Findings SCII, SCI and SCRE have significant positive relationships. About 41% of SCII and SCRE are partially mediated by SCI.Research limitations/implications Considering variations in perception of SCRE, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits generalizability and transferability. Experiments and interviews are recommended to explore differences between firms in SCRE.Practical implications SCII and SCI capabilities buffer a firmâ€™s SCRE.Originality/value This study establishes SCI as a mediator between SCII and SCRE by studying manufacturing firms in a developing country context.
