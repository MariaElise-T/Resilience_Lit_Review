The COVID-19 pandemic, constant natural disasters, the economic crisis, and other recent global uncertainties have exacerbated the problems of numerous organizations that are currently in decline. Educational institutions, especially smaller ones that lack financial reserves to weather economic storms, are not immune to collapse. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the Philippines, several schools were fighting for survival. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak along with other challenges underlines the importance of organizational resilience. Organizational resilience is the capacity to prepare for, anticipate, respond to, cope with, adapt to, and learn from adverse events. It is influenced by lots of factors, including culture and leadership. It is also an interplay of different dimensions, making this construct multilevel. Each level of resilience may or may not necessarily lead to resilience at one level. Therefore, this study used literature review to investigate how resilience at one level can facilitate the development of resilience at another level. Additionally, it also examined the influences of organizational culture and leadership on each organizational resilience level. The results will benefit Filipino-Chinese school administrators, HR practitioners, researchers, school employees, and other decision makers.
