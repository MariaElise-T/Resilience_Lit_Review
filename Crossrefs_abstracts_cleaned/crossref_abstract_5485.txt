Abstract
The crisis caused by the Covid pandemic is certainly the major disruptive event of this first quarter century, the Russian-Ukrainian military crisis also having the potential (in terms of the global dysfunctions generated) to fit into this typology. Beyond the clear negative effects (social, human, economic, etc.) of the Covid pandemic, however, we must also consider the possible challenges it may pose. The research question of the present article is situated in this thematic register, on a niche topic, urban resilience, re-evaluated, following the materialization of this pandemic context, both in academic research and in terms of contemporary management practice. It is intended, in conjunction with a bibliometric analysis, to highlight possible directions of action within the triple and quadruple helix models for strengthening urban resilience based on the lessons learned from this crisis, directions that are considered useful to a wide range of stakeholders in academia, industry and government. While there is sufficient concern directed towards determining resilience indices, the main thesis considered for this article is that there is a need for synergistic stakeholder action, integrating such elaborations into the proactive framework of a robust yet scalable urban resilience profile in relation to a wide range of events across the urban community security threat spectrum, as was the case with Covid 19.
