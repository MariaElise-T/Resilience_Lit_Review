Teachers’ traits are fundamental factors that determine how teachers can withstand their motivation and commitment in times of change. Researchers consistently provide evidence on the strong correlation concerning a teacher’s performance with two important traits, resilience, and sense of self-efficacy. The 2019 Corona virus pandemic brought a lot of changes and challenges to teachers. Many countries have turned to e-learning to continue education, where in face-to-face interaction with their learners is no longer an option. The purpose of this research is to examine the resilience and sense of self-efficacy among Filipino educators during 2019 Corona virus pandemic throughout the S.Y. 2020 – 2021. For the data gathering, the researcher used Scale Short Form and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, both are descriptive studies of correlation that utilize Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy. The researcher randomly selected respondents that constitutes 126 faculty members from various secondary public schools from three island groups of the Philippines Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Findings suggested that majority of the teacher-respondents has moderately high level of resilience and proximate to having high level of resilience. Close results also revealed high levels from three domains of teachers’ sense of self-efficacy. The results suggested that teachers are capable to perform student engagement, intellectualize and execute instructional strategies and manage online classroom. The Pearson Chi-square statistics revealed that the level of resilience has significant relationship with level of sense of self-efficacy among secondary public-school teachers. Further research could deepen the relationship between resilience, efficacy, work satisfaction and performance.
