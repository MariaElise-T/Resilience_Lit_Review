Abstract

Objective
Cognitive dysfunction is known to occur in many individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is currently known about MS patients without cognitive impairment, including protective factors associated with intact cognition. The present study considered these issues in a sample of MS patients screened for intact subjective and objective cognitive functioning.


Methods
Two MS participant groups from a larger sample were derived: i) participants within 1 standard deviation of controls on measures of objective cognition, subjective cognition, and informant-observed subjective cognition [cognitively resilient MS group (MScr)], and ii) those classified as not cognitively resilient (MSncr). Both groups were compared with age- and gender-matched controls.


Results
Findings indicated that the MScr group was similar to the MSncr group on most disease and demographic variables, and level of fatigue. The MScr group showed higher estimated baseline intellectual ability and reported less anxiety, subclinical depressive symptoms, and pain interference. MScr participants also showed a trend toward more reported compensatory cognitive strategy use than MSncr participants. The MScr group showed comparable reading recognition and pain symptoms to controls.


Conclusions
Our findings provide preliminary information on factors associated with cognitive resilience in MS. Future research should examine resilient individuals with MS to further clarify positive outcomes in this condition.
