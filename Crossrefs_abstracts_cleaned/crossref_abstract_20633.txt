Klotho (KL) is a glycosyl hydrolase and aging-suppressor gene. Stress is a risk factor for depression and anxiety, which are highly comorbid with each other. The aim of this study is to determine whether KL is regulated by estrogen and plays an important role in sex differences in stress resilience. Our results showed that KL is regulated by estrogen in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro and is essential for the estrogen-mediated increase in the number of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1)-positive clusters on the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. The role of KL in sex differences in stress response was examined in rats using 3-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). CUMS produced a deficit in spatial learning and memory, anhedonic-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors in male but not female rats, which was accompanied by a reduction in KL protein levels in the hippocampus of male but not female rats. This demonstrated the resilience of female rats to CUMS. Interestingly, the knockdown of KL protein levels in the rat hippocampus of both sexes caused a decrease in stress resilience in both sexes, especially in female rats. These results suggest that the regulation of KL by estrogen plays an important role in estrogen-mediated synapse formation and that KL plays a critical role in the sex differences in cognitive deficit, anhedonic-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors induced by chronic stress in rats, highlighting an important role of KL in sex differences in stress resilience.
