The severity of the 2007–2008 economic crisis and the spatial heterogeneity of its impact have accelerated the study of regional economic resilience. The economic crisis has affected most parts of the world, and its impact is highly heterogeneous within China. The aim of this study was to explore the determinants of regional economic resilience across 284 Chinese cities from 2003–2018. Both nation-based and province-based regional economic resilience were examined. A multilevel logistic regression model was established, finding a disparity of provincial effects on regional performance during the economic crisis. Regional economic resilience is significantly affected by provincial trajectories, economy size, and resources. There are five significant determinants of economic resilience: income inequality, innovation, government intervention, human capital, and financial development. The results provide evidence for the government to design region-based policies, taking into consideration the size and the resources of the region’s economy to build a resilient wall to defend against external shocks and to form a basis for sustainable development.
