 The effects of several variables that may influence the resilient modulus of fine-grained subgrade soils have been studied using two different soils. The number of load applications, the rest period, and the load sequence are shown to have no significant effect on the measured resilient modulus. It is also demonstrated that confining pressure in the range of 0 to 69 kPa (0 to 10 psi) has less than a 5 percent effect on the measured resilient modulus of the investigated soils. However, the condition of specimen ends is shown to influence the measured resilient modulus. A comparison between the measured resilient modulus for both soils using impact and kneading compaction methods is also presented.
