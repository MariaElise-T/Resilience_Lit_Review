In urgent situations where tensions and conflicts are amplified, emergency room nurses are vulnerable to violence and are exposed to dangerous situations because they are confronted by patients or caregivers. This study sought to examine the relationship between violence experience, resilience, and nursing performance among emergency room nurses in South Korea. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. The study participants included 130 nurses working in the emergency room of a general hospital. Measures included the general characteristics list, the violence experience tool, the resilience tool, and the nursing performance tool. Data were collected from February to March 2021. In this study, among the forms of violence experienced by emergency room nurses, verbal violence was most prevalent. The violence experiences showed significant differences according to age, clinical experience, work experience in the emergency room, position, and job satisfaction. Resilience displayed significant differences according to marital status, clinical experience, position, average monthly salary, and job satisfaction. Nursing performance showed significant differences based on gender, age, marital status, clinical experience, work experience in the emergency room, position, average monthly salary, and job satisfaction. There was a positive correlation between resilience and nursing performance. This study suggests that emergency room nurses in Korea experienced more verbal violence than other types of violence. The violence experiences, resilience, and nursing performance showed significant differences according to the general and job-related characteristics of the study participants. Concrete strategies and interventions to reduce the frequency of experiences of verbal violence among emergency room nurses, increase their resilience, and improve the nursing performance of emergency room nurses are needed.
