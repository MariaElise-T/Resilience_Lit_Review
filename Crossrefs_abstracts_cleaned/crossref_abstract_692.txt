 The Resiliency Scale for Young Adults (RSYA) is presented as an upward extension of the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA). The RSYA is based on the three-factor model of personal resiliency including mastery, relatedness, and emotional reactivity. Several stages of scale development and studies leading to the current RSYA are described that provide construct validity (i.e., internal consistency, confirmatory factor analyses, and convergentâ€“divergent validity) support for the three-factor structure and 10 subscales of this measure for young adults who are attending college. This work is a step in a longer-term project of translating the constructs of personal resiliency for application across the life span.
