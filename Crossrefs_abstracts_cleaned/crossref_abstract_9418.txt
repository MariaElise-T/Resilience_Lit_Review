ABSTRACT
					 A specific psychotherapeutic strategy for increasing psychological well‐being and resilience, well‐being therapy, has been developed and validated in a number of randomized controlled trials. The findings indicate that flourishing and resilience can be promoted by specific interventions leading to a positive evaluation of one's self, a sense of continued growth and development, the belief that life is purposeful and meaningful, the possession of quality relations with others, the capacity to manage effectively one's life, and a sense of self‐determination. A decreased vulnerability to depression and anxiety has been demonstrated after well‐being therapy in high‐risk populations. There are important implications for the state/trait dichotomy in psychological well‐being and for the concept of recovery in mood and anxiety disorders.
