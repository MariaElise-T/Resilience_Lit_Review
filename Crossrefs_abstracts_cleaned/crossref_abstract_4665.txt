Objectives  The Purpose of This study is to verify the moderating effect of ego resilience on the relationship between school stress and depression in high school girl students.
Methods  For this purpose, a questionnaire was conducted targeting first and second graders of humanities high school located in U city Korea, and 303 copies were used for the final statistical analysis. For the collected data, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis were performed for each variable using the SPSS 22.0 statistical program, and the moderating effect was verified using Process Macro for SPSS V3.5 Model 1.
Results  First, school stress (r=.757, p<.001) showed a positive correlation with depression, and between ego resilience (r=-.449, p<.001) and school stress, ego resilience (r=-.415, p<.05) and depression showed a negative correlation. Second, it was confirmed that ego elasticity acts as a moderating variable in the relationship between school stress and depression in high school girls students(Î²=-.245, p<.001). It was found that the regression coefficient of the interaction term by school stress and ego resilience had a negatively significant relationship.
Conclusions  This study is meaningful in that it provided a basis for developing and utilizing counseling and education programs for enhancing self-resilience by examining the moderating effect of ego resilience in the relationship between school stress and depression in high school girl students.
