PurposeThis paper proposes a model composed by macro-competences developed to contribute for the resilience of public organizations.Design/methodology/approachTo propose the model, a literature review in the area of organizations resilience was carried out, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used. The setting used to validate the proposed model was the Brazilian Federal Institutions of Higher Education.FindingsThe results present five dimensions of action seen as macro-competences that contribute for organizationsâ€™ resilience: human resource management, development of individual competencies, risk management, preparedness for response, and responsiveness. The results also point at competences that can be developed in each of those dimensions with a view toward resilience.Practical implicationsCompetences of strategically planning the workforces, of testing the risk hypotheses continuously, and applying the action plans proposed by risk management in response to crises can improve individual and organizational resiliencies.Originality/valueGuided by the proposed model, public organizations will be better prepared to withstand adversities, such as resources cutbacks and staff shortages.
