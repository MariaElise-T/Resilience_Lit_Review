We find the loss of demands caused by a severe fault or even failure of cells in the urban telecommunication network could be compensated by two types of resilience, namely intra-sector resilience and inter-sector resilience. Intra-sector resilience is stemmed from the multi-cell design of base stations. Inter-sector resilience manifests as the partial absorption of the loss of demand by the nearby base stations. In the investigated ToC telecommunication network, the two types of resilience are practically observable. It implies that resilience is an essential factor in preserving the serviceability of telecommunication networks.
