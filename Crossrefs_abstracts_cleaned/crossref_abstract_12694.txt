 This paper analyses relations between the urban city-core of Copenhagen and its peri-urban hinterland in the period after the recession of 2009. The paper demonstrates that there are differences within the functional city-region in resilience and the ability to create new growth paths, and that this ability is dependent on changing relationships between the city and the hinterland. The city-core has been able to sustain its development path, partly, by pushing the recessionary shock to the peri-urban hinterland. Yet, the major development problem for the peri-urban hinterland of Copenhagen is its inability to produce substantial new high-skill employment.
