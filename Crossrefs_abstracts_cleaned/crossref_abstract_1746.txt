The concepts of resilience and entrepreneurship in emergency management can contribute to increasing the ability to cope with threats. However, research and analysis in this area are limited. Research on resilience and entrepreneurship in emergency management has largely focused on the impact of these concepts on emergency management, with limited attempts to find out how they interact together. For this reason, the aim of this article is to systematize the knowledge of the role of resilience and entrepreneurship in emergency management and to establish mutual relations between these concepts. The aim of this article was achieved based on a systematic literature review using the PRISMA Group methodology. As a result, the characteristics and impact of both resilience and entrepreneurship on emergency management were presented, the importance of these concepts in social terms was shown, and the mutual interactions between them were identified. The obtained results indicate that emergencies constitute change accelerators that create opportunities for social and public entrepreneurship development. Resilience and entrepreneurship interact; together they create better abilities to deal with threats.
