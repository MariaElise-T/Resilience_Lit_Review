Background The resilience of nursing students has a positive impact on their wellbeing and completion of courses, especially during pandemics like Covid-19. However, research on resilience factors among nursing students is limited to India. Aim This qualitative study aimed to explore senior nursing studentsâ€™ perceptions of resilience factors in recovery from Covid-19 infection. Methods The virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted among final year undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary care center. We used an interview guide with semi-structured questions to collect the data. Results A narrative content analysis revealed four dominant themes: experiences and concerns while caring for patients with Covid-19 infection (subtheme: lack of adequate knowledge and skills, support by clinical preceptors, inadequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, fear of acquiring and spreading of Covid-19 infection to friends and other patients), reactions to Covid-19 infection (subtheme: anxiety, fear of rejection, academic worries, and uncertainty of illness), resilience (subtheme: support by seniors, teachers, friends, family support, positive self-concept, relaxation techniques, and organization support), and willingness to serve patients with Covid-19 infection (subtheme: professional responsibility, personal experiences, role models, and supportive working environment). Conclusions The findings suggest that it is crucial to prepare nursing students for adversity through resilience training. Further, studies that develop and evaluate effective strategies to promote resilience among nursing students are urgently needed.
