This article draws attention and describes the importance of resilience as a protective factor in both mental and social maturing processes. The topic was inspired by the SPARK Resilience (ISKRA Odporności) pilot prevention programme, whose aim is to support emotional immunity defined as the ability to control reactions to events and to cope with stress. This article presents the programme’s assumptions and the conclusions from the first part of the research that serve to evaluate it. A group of 433 students from 13 schools in Poland from the 5th to 8th grades of primary school and the 1st grade of secondary school were surveyed in the selected procedure. The surveys conducted via the Internet used, among others, the SPP-18 scale developed by N. Ogińska-Bulikand Z. Juczyński. The research demonstrated the respondents’ level of resilience, which turned out to be significantly lower in the surveyed girls than in the boys.
