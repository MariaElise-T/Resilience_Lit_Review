 This paper is concerned with the problem of finite-time H∞ resilient filtering for a class of switch systems. The filtering error dynamics is constructed based on the H∞ resilient filter. The objective is to design a filter such that the finite-time H∞ gain from the unknown input to an estimation error is minimized or guaranteed to be less than or equal to a prescribed value. By selecting the proper multiple Lyapunov function and using the average dwell-time approach, sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence of the desired H∞ resilient filter, which also guarantee the finite-time boundedness of the filtering error dynamic systems. The design criteria are proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities and then described as an optimization algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.
