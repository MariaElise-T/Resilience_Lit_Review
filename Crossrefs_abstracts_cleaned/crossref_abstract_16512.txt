Abstract
Farmers are the vanguard of national food providers. However, they still have not yet received much serious attention and assistance. This condition is exacerbated by unpredictable climate change. Therefore, it is crucial to have an analytics tool to assist farmers in resolving production problems with some variables such as soil condition, season, and plant species. Decision support system (DSS) in agriculture helps farmers in making decisions based on previous research results. However, DSS in some countries are available, but not widely used by the farmers. This study aims to analyze the possibility of developing DSS to increase the resilience capacity of farmers in Indonesia. The method used in this research was a literature study and descriptive analysis. The results showed that there is still a long way to go in achieving the robust DSS, referring to the quality of research results so far. To elaborate on this, it is necessary to make a research roadmap in this field by understanding the current research status. Moreover, DSS will be a form of contribution from researchers in providing reliable and updated public information packages for a better agricultural management.
