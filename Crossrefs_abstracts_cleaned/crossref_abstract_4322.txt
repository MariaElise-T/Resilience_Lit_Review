 The resilient modulus of pavement materials is an important parameter in pavement analysis and design. In recent years the emphasis of research has primarily been concentrated on investigating the resilient modulus of subgrade materials. Information is lacking on the resilient modulus of base materials for determining the properties of pavement layers. The results of field plate bearing load tests and laboratory resilient modulus tests on lime rock base materials are presented. Correlation relationships between the field layer modulus and the laboratory resilient modulus are evaluated. Comparison of the computed resilient modulus of the base layer with the layer modulus from the plate bearing load test under identical moisture and density conditions indicated a trend of increasing laboratory resilient modulus with increasing plate load modulus. The average values of the layer modulus backcalculated from the plate bearing load tests were higher than those of the computed equivalent resilient modulus from the laboratory tests with the averaged applied stresses in the elastic range.
