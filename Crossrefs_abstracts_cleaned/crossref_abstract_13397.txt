This article presents the school resilience profile for seven high schools in Makassar, Indonesia and explains the relationship between school resilience and bullying behavior at the schools. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the status of school resilience, the dynamics of the bullying phenomenon in the schools, and the relationship between school resilience and bullying. The data were obtained using a structured questionnaire administered to 490 high school students (Grade 11, aged 15-17). The results of the analysis suggest that the six main aspects of school resilience have been implemented in the studied high schools. Further, the results indicate that increasing school resilience could reduce the occurrence of bullying cases. The measures the schools have implemented to improve school resilience are expected to continue to lower the occurrence of bullying cases. The results of this study provide valuable data for the development of effective school resilience-based anti-bullying policies.
