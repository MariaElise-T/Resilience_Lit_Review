Introduction: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of narrative therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy on Resilience in women with breast surgery experience.
Methods: This was a semi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest, controlled design with follow-up. The study population consisted of all women with breast cancer who were undergoing postmastectomy radiotherapy in Tabriz in 2018. In total, 30 women were selected by a purposive sampling method, and divided into three groups of narrative therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, and control. The intervention groups received their respective treatments over 8 sessions of 1.5 hours. The groups were assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale before, after, and four months after the treatment.
Results: The mean postintervention resilience scores for the narrative therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy groups (66.4 and 79.9, respectively) were significantly greater compared with the control group (51.9) (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed at the 4-mont follow-up indicating a lasting effect. Also, the effect of rational emotive behavior therapy on resilience was greater than that of narrative therapy both after the intervention and at 4-month follow-up (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Narrative therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy increased resiliency in women with breast surgery experience.
