Introduction:   Globally,  nursing  is  perceived  as  a  demanding  and  stressful  profession.  In  recent  studies,  the  psychological   well-being of employed nurses has been given considerable attention. Considering that nursing students are the future of the  nursing workforce; it is important that we increase our understanding of the importance of resilience in this population. Aim:  This  study  examines  turnover  intention  and  burnout  among  Palestinian  nursing  students  and  how  resilience  and   sociodemographic factors affected these outcomes. Methods:  The study included 409 nursing students from three major institutions in the West Bank-Palestine. The data was  collected using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Burnout scale, as well as key demographic data, including the intention  to leave the nursing profession in the future. Results:  Participants  displayed  moderate  levels  of  resilience  and  burnout,  and  the  analysis  revealed  a  negative  correlation   between resilience and burnout (r = -0.35). The study findings indicated that almost half of the students were not satisfied with  their nursing major and half of them intended to leave the nursing profession in the future. Higher resilience was associated  with intention to stay in the nursing profession, male gender, satisfaction with nursing major, employment, living on campus,  receiving support from friends and family, and studying a week or more before the exam. While intentions to leave nursing,  lack of support from family and friends, higher academic levels lower GPAs, studying an hour or less per day, and studying one  day before an exam were all associated with higher burnout. Conclusion:  Effective measures should be taken to reduce studentsâ€™ burnout and turnover intention.
