 This study aims to understand how people living at the edge of their familial group as marginalized members (i.e., “black sheep”) enact resilience. Inductive analysis of interviews with 30 marginalized family members uncovered five resilience strategies marginalized family members engage in to come to terms with their position in the family, repair family relationships, and/or create a new sense of normalcy: (a) seeking support from communication networks, (b) creating and negotiating boundaries, (c) (re)building while recognizing negative experiences, (d) downplaying the lived experience of marginalization, and (e) living authentically despite disapproval. This research extends the resilience framework by exploring situated resilience strategies engaged in by marginalized family members. Practical implications for marginalized family members, their families, and family counselors are discussed along with avenues for future research examining the marginalization of diverse employees.
