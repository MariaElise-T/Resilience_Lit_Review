 Research suggests that adult women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA) vary on whether and how they experience long-term effects. According to current literature, the variation appears to be due to both risk and protective factors. In addition, the variation also appears to occur in connection with certain factors that function to help buffer the effects of CSA. The purpose of this study is to identify the protective factors that best predict resilience in a sample of 134 female adults who are members of AMAC (Adults Molested as Children). The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
