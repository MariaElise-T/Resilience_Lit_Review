BackgroundAs mobile phone use grows, so it brings benefits and risks. As an important part of adolescents healthy growth, resilience plays an indispensable role. Thus, it is important to identify when mobile phone use of an adolescent becomes an addiction. This study proposed to explore the effects of adolescent resilience on mobile phone addiction, and tested the mediating role of coping style and depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS) on phone addiction among 2,268 adolescents in the Henan province, China.MethodsThe adolescents were surveyed via an online questionnaire, a mobile phone addiction index (MPAI), a depression, anxiety, and stress scale with 21 items (DASS-21), the Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents (RSCA), and the Simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ), and we used structural equation modeling to examine the correlations and moderation effects. All data analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 and Amos 23.0.ResultsThe results show that adolescences resilience were negatively related to negative coping, DASS, and mobile phone addiction; both coping style and DASS could mediate the relationship between adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction among Chinese adolescents. The relationship between adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction in Chinese adolescents was mediated by the chain of coping styles and DASS.ConclusionsThere is a negative relationship which exists between resilience and mobile phone addiction in this population. In addition, stress, anxiety, depression, and coping style significantly influence the risk of adolescent mobile phone addiction and play an intermediary role in Chinese adolescent resilience and mobile phone addiction.
