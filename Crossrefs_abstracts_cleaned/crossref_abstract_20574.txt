Introduction:  The rehabilitation of people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) should encourage resilience, which is a complex issue that involves self-esteem, social support, life meaningfulness and life satisfaction in order to prevent suicidal ideation. Objective: To analyze resilience and its relationship with suicidal ideation, self-esteem, social support, life meaningfulness and life satisfaction in people with SCI. Methods: Quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational and comparative study carried out with 204 Brazilian adults with SCI. Data were collected with previously validated instruments using an online platform. Results: Among the participants, 74% were male, with a mean age of 36.1 years (SP=9.24), 64.7% were retired or receiving benefits, and with an average time of injury of 8.6 (SP=7, 73). Suicidal ideation (p≤0.001), self-esteem (p≤0.001), social support, life satisfaction (p≤0.001) and life meaningfulness (p≤0.001) were strongly associated with resilience. Discussion: The variables related to mental health were shown to be influenced by resilience, indicating that participants with higher levels of resilience have better results in the assessment of emotional factors. Implications for practice: It is recommended that psychological and social factors be considered in the rehabilitation of people with SCI.
