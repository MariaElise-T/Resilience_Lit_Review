 Dynamic resilience is a temporal process that reflects individuals’ capability to overcome task-induced stress and sustain their performance during task-related events. First-order autoregressive (AR(1)) modelling is posited for measuring individuals’ dynamic resilience over time. The current research investigated this by testing 30 adults in a dynamic decision-making task. AR(1) modelling was conducted on the data, and was compared against a modified seismic resilience metric for concurrent validity purposes. Results revealed that AR(1) modeled parameters are applicable in assessing participants’ dynamic resilience, with analyses supporting their use to distinguish between individuals that can overcome task-induced stress and those that cannot, as well as, in the classification of individuals’ dynamic resilience.
