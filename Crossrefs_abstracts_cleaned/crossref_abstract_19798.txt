The resilience of the city of Smederevo in the area of reducing the risk of torrential floods is not at a satisfactory level. About thirty torrents have been recorded on the territory of the city of Smederevo, and their general condition is alarming. With the development of urbanization, some of them have been introduced into sewage systems and rainwater collectors, which are mostly of insufficient dimensions for receiving large waters. In order to reduce the damage caused by floods, it is necessary to envisage and implement certain works every year, the General Urban Plan of Smederevo specifies flood zones, prohibits any type of construction in them and determine areas for future retentions. Torrential floods cause great damage to settlements and the economy, so the degree of threat from flooding must be analyzed as well as the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. The influence of anthropogenic factors on the state of order of torrent watercourses in the area of Smederevo is manifested in two ways - passive and active. The city of Smederevo implements integral flood defense on the entire territory of the city, and the aim of this paper is to point out the basic problems in the current flood protection and the possible directions towards which the local self-government of Smederevo should be directed.
