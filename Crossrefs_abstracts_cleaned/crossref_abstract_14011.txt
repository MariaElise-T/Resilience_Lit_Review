Purpose
The purpose of the current study is to examine organizational crisis and the role of tech-structural interventions in overcoming the crisis to achieve resilience. Developing resilience in organizations has become imperative for managers in the never-ending turbulent environment and concerns toward pleasing the stakeholders. Organizations have begun to rely on techno-structural and human process change interventions to attain resilient organizations. Although such strategies are widely prevalent in organizational change literature and can be traced back to the 1970s, scholarly research on the process that develops resilient organizations is limited and also absent in the context of developing economies.

This study uncovered the process of change interventions (primarily techno-structural interventions) at a wealth management firm in India, adopting a case study approach.


Findings
According to the findings, change interventions through techno-structural interventions aided in the transformation of a precarious organization into a resilient one.


Research limitations/implications
This paper provides vital practical implications about the role of techno-structural change interventions in reshaping an organization into a more viable business, making the organization resilient to deal with untimely disruptions in the environment.


Originality/value
Very limited research has been done to understand the stakeholderâ€™s management and resilience in the context of financial consulting firms in the emerging market context.
