AbstractCaring for their chronically ill or disabled family members is a responsibility that may be assumed by children and adolescents (“young carers”) and may affect young carers’ lives in many ways. Some young carers may experience long‐term adverse health effects related to their early caring responsibilities and others may demonstrate healthy adaptation. Little research applying nonretrospective designs, however, has been done from the perspective of young carers regarding the psychosocial resources that enable them to handle the responsibility of caring for chronically ill or disabled family members. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to identify psychosocial resources used by young carers in Austria. Ten children and adolescents (aged 9–17) took photographs to illustrate their everyday lives. The photographs were then used to guide subsequent interviews. Data were analyzed following the principles of directed qualitative content analysis and using the theoretical lens of resilience. We identified two sets of psychosocial resources: (1) Personal resources comprising (a) being able to spend leisure time and (b) finding distraction from sorrows and problems. (2) Interpersonal resources comprising (a) fostering meaningful friendships, (b) receiving support from the family, and (c) bonding with the ill or disabled family member. Young carers largely have the same repertoire of resources as other children and can use them specifically to respond to the care burden. Interventions to support young carers must focus on promoting peer contact and cohesion within the nuclear family as well as bonding with the ill or disabled relative.
