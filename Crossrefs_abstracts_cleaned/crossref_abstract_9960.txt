The main purpose of this study is to examine the mediation role of personal meaning profile in the relationship between resilience capacity and meaning in life. Data has been collected from 371 college students using Resilience, Personal Meaning Profile and Meaning in Life Scales. Jamovi 1.1.4 statistical program has been used for the analysis of the data. In the study, it has been observed that there exist meaningful relationships between the sub-dimensions of the personal meaning profile and resilience besides meaning in life. Results show that there is a meaningful and positive relation between resilience and meaning in life. It has been also observed that there has been a positive relation between meaning in life and the achievement, relationship, self-transcendence, self-acceptance, intimacy, and fairness sub-dimensions of the personal meaning profile. However, no meaningful relationship between resilience and the religion sub-dimension of the personal meaning profile has been found. Considering the findings of the research, there is a significant mediation role of the personal meaning profile, except for the religion and self-acceptance sub-dimensions, in the relationship between the resilience capacity and the meaning in life. All findings have been discussed in terms of literature and the suggestion for further studies has been made.
