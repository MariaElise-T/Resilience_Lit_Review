 Resilience has not impacted greatly in youth justice to date, yet holds great promise for practice. This article explores salient features of thinking around resilience, in particular Michael Ungar’s research on how young people search for power and identity using whatever resources they can access.

The opportunities and challenges for practice lie in collaborative work to enable young people to use these strengths, skills and capacities to create more positive futures.
