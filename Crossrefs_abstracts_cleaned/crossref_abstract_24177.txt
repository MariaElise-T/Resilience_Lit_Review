AbstractAimsThe present study investigated the association between resilience, stigma, life satisfaction and the intention to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination among Chinese HCWs. It also explored the mediating role of stigma and life satisfaction on the association between resilience and intention to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination.DesignAn anonymous cross‐sectional survey.Methods1733 HCWs from five hospitals in four provinces of mainland China completed a cross‐sectional online survey in October and November 2020.ResultsAmong the HCWs, the rate of intention to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination was 73.1%. Results from structural equation modelling showed that resilience was associated both directly, and indirectly with greater intent to receive a COVID‐19 vaccination through two pathways: first by increasing life satisfaction, and second by reducing stigma and increasing life satisfaction.ConclusionPromoting the resilience of HCWs has the potential to increase the COVID‐19 vaccination uptake rate among HCWs in China.ImpactThis study tested the relationship between several psychological factors and the COVID‐19 vaccination intention of HCWs in China, finding that resilience played a significant role in improving COVID‐19 vaccination intention rates by reducing stigma and increasing life satisfaction.
