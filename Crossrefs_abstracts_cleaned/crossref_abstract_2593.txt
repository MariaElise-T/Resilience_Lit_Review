 This paper reviews current literature to offer a discussion related to burnout, an issue that affects the entire healthcare sector, including nurses and patients. Literature suggests a correlation between moral distress and burnout in nurses. These issues are considered to be current and affect recruitment and retention of nurses. The authors propose supporting nurses by using knowledge of resilient behaviours as a means of transcending burnout and workplace stress. The authors believe that this process can be achieved through existing hospital professional development processes, for example supervision, reflective practice, in-service education and other forms of professional development.
