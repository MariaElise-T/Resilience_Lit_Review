In the face of increasing disturbance factors, resilience has become an important criterion for measuring the sustainable development of cities. Quantitatively describing the development process of urban resilience and identifying key areas and important dimensions of urban resilience are of scientific significance for understanding the evolutionary law of urban resilience, guiding regional risk prevention, and building an environment for urban resilience development. For this study, taking Nanchang City as a case study and dividing the natural water network groups, the resilience index system was constructed from scale, density, morphology, and function by drawing on the theory of landscape ecology on the basis of considering the internal relationship between urban development attributes and disturbance factors. On this basis, the study focuses on the evolution process and development differences of resilience in various dimensions from the water network groups and quantitatively describes the coordinated development status and adaptive phase characteristics of urban resilience. This study not only enriches the research scale and perspective of urban resilience but also provides specific spatial guidance for formulating resilient urban planning and promoting sustainable urban development.
