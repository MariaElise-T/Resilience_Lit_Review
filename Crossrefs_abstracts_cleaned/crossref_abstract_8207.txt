 Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that more than 40 per cent of Australian children moved their place of residence at least once in the Census period from 1996 to 2001 (ABS, 2001a). The literature varies in its assessment of the impact that this has on children. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between residential relocation, resilience and the emotional, behavioural and academic adjustment of children aged 8-12 years who had moved home. Risk factors and the relative impact of resilience were examined. Results highlight the importance of good schooling and suggest that building and enhancing the intellectual functioning of children is a vital component in the development of resilience. Different aspects of resilience may be important for different developmental stages and life stressors. We discuss the distinction between cause and effect when examining resilience factors and suggest that outcomes in one context may be treated as influences on outcomes in another context.
