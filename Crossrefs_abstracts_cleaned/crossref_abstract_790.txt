AbstractThe objective of this article is to describe the Community Resiliency Model (CRM)®, a sensory-focused, self-care modality for mental well-being in diverse communities, and CRM’s emerging evidence base and neurobiological underpinnings as a task-sharing intervention. Frieden’s Health Impact Pyramid (HIP) is used as a lens for mental healthcare interventions and their public health impact, with CRM examples. CRM, a sensory awareness model for self-care and mental well-being in acute and chronic stress states, is supported by neurobiological theory and a growing evidence base. CRM can address mental wellness needs at multiple levels of the HIP and matches the task-sharing concept to increase access to mental health resources globally. CRM has the potential for making a significant population mental health impact as an easily disseminated, mental health, self-care modality; it may be taught by trained professionals, lay persons, and community members. CRM carries task-sharing to a new level: scalable and sustainable, those who learn CRM can share the wellness skills informally with persons in their social networks. CRM may alleviate mental distress and reduce stigma, as well as serve a preventive function for populations facing environmental, political, and social threats.
