The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people's lives, requiring a shift in focus to short‐term survival and management of changes in relationships, academic and work environments, and future career options. Understandably, one of the most seminal aspects of career development—deciding on a future career—can seem overwhelming or even irrelevant in the face of such challenges. Neuroscience research offers a scientifically grounded framework for understanding the impact of chronic acute stressors, such as COVID‐19, on functioning and can provide direction for interventions that foster resilience and support clients' ability to reengage in career decision‐making. We discuss research related to the neuroscience of stress and resilience and ways to apply that information within career counseling.
