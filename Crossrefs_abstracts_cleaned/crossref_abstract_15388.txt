Abstract
This study aims to investigate the relationship between trait anxiety and mental resilience in marathoners and the general population. The study recruited 135 marathoners and 140 members of the general population. Trait anxiety and mental resilience were measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Scale and the Chinese version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. The amount of weekly exercise resulted in significant differences in the trait anxiety (F = 6.358, p < 0.01) and mental resilience (F = 5.996, p < 0.05) levels of the general population and marathoners. Age led to a significant difference in the trait anxiety of marathoners (F = 10.890, p < 0.01). The half marathoners' daily exercise program is most suitable for the general population for reducing trait anxiety level and increasing mental resilience. Furthermore, marathoners showed lower trait anxiety and higher mental resilience. Therefore, long-term marathon adherence can help improve mental health.
