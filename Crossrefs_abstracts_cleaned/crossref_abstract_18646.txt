 The application of high-strength steel has been limited due to stiffness and ductility issues. In tension-only concentrically braced steel beam-through frames (TOCBBTFs), the frame is designed to remain elastic while concentrating damage on the replaceable braces during rare earthquakes, which makes the structure able to recover quickly. Therefore, there is a high potential to apply high-strength steel to the design of the main frames. A design approach is first proposed to achieve seismic resilience for multi-degree-of-freedom TOCBBTFs under rare earthquakes and it is verified by non-linear time history analysis. The main idea is to specify a target drift of the structure within the range between the yielding of braces and the frame. Based on this design approach, different ways to apply high-strength steel to TOCBBTFs are studied. The results show that using high-strength steel can benefit TOCBBTFs in enhancing the seismic resilience performance and reducing the total cost of steel.
