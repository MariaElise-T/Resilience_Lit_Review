 In a unique follow-up study, Hispanic (Dominican American) students identified as resilient 10 years ago were reinterviewed to assess their interim progress, and explore how their educational and professional achievements have evolved over time. By having the students reflect on their beliefs a decade ago and how those beliefs have evolved in light of their academic and professional achievements, the study provides a rare view into the time-sensitive phenomenon of enduring resilience.
