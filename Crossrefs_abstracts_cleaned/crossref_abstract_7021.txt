Abstract
Purpose: It is becoming increasingly well known that higher levels of premorbid psychological resiliency in athletes predict better recovery outcomes from sports-related concussion and other types of injuries. This review addresses the current state of interventions designed to increase resilience in athletes. Methods: A thorough search of the literature was conducted using the keywords “increasing resilience in athletes” and “resilience, interventions, athletes” via Google Scholar, PubMed, and PsycINFO. Papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2017–2022 that focused on an intervention or set of skills that increased resilience in an athlete population were included. 33 studies were initially identified and 18 fit the criteria for this review. Results: There are many promising interventions for increasing resilience in athletes. Treatments fell into three general categories, including increasing positive thoughts and feelings, increasing interoceptive awareness/connection, and increasing quality of social support. All studies implemented pre- and post- intervention assessments to measure change over time, and some included randomization to treatment or control groups. Importantly, many resilience interventions encouraged athletes to reframe help-seeking behaviors as a resilient act rather than one of weakness and focused on increasing the quality of social support from teammates, athletic trainers, friends, and family. Conclusions: Interventions covering a variety of strategies show promise in increasing athletes’ resilience across many sports. Successful treatments ranged from one 30-minute workshop to season-long training sessions. Future directions for resilience interventions should examine the use of technology to administer and/or monitor resilience change, as well as novel approaches including gamifying interventions to make them more palatable.
