The purpose of this study was to verify whether the type of national disaster management organization affects resilience capability and organizational effectiveness. In the present study, we analyzed a previous study conducted by Hollnagel on the inter-relationship between resilience capability and organizational effectiveness. Our results confirmed that public officers who are in charge of disaster management need to increase their resilience capability in order to improve organizational effectiveness. However, we cannot conclude that disaster management efficiency is improved only by increasing public officers' resilience capability. This study suggests that a dedicated organization for disaster management should be created to ensure effective handling of disasters. The influence of the type of organization should be considered, based on the results of this study.
