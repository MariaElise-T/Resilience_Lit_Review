Survivors of the 921 Earthquake in the Tung Shih areas were the target population for this study. The researchers used purposive sampling strategies to select information-rich participants for study in depth. A total of 15 interviewees and 8 focus group members participated in this study. Qualitative data analysis software, ATLAS.ti 5.5, was used for cross-case and content analyses. The results indicate that acceptance, preparedness, self-reliance, spirituality, Hakka spirit, resource availability, social support networks, and serving others have positive impacts on disaster resilience. Participants from the in-depth interviews group affirm the importance of government involvement. Participants from the focus group pay special attentions on re-establishing social support networks. Furthermore, they reinforce the importance of understanding culture and meanings for the local people.
