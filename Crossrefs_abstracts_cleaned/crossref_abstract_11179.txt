Despite the increased effort to understand resilience processes in the lives of youth, the homogeneity of a largely westernized concept needs to be challenged in studies by incorporating meanings of resilience more relevant to youth around the globe. This requires a reconsideration of the methods used to study youth resilience. This article outlines the interactive dialogical process involved in visual elicitation methods that combine moving and still images, resulting in a broader reflective exploration of research questions. Consideration is given specifically to how the combination of these methods better facilitates exploration of previously unarticulated experiences of marginalized youth populations and the processes they engage in to nurture and sustain resilience.
