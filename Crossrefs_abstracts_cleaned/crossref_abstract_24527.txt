Background and Objectives: Chronic kidney disease is a debilitating disease that can also affect the family caregivers of patients. Increasing awareness and empowering caregivers can improve the physical and mental condition of patients and the resilience of caregivers. This study aims to evaluate the effect of an intervention based on the family-centered empowerment model (FCEM) on the resilience of family caregivers of hemodialysis patients. Methods: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty family caregivers of patients in the hemodialysis department of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran were selected by a random sampling method using a random number table. Then, they were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n=30) and control (n=30). The assessment tools were a demographic form and the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data in SPSS software, version 18. Results: The results of independent t-test showed that the mean resilience score at baseline was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.29). After the intervention, it was significantly increased in the intervention group compared to the control group (P<0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-intervention scores of  resilience in the intervention group (P<0.001), but no significant difference was found in the control group (P=0.17). Conclusion: The FCEM-based intervention increases the resilience of family caregivers of hemodialysis patients. Therefore, it is recommended that the planners in nursing education should make nurses aware of the importance of providing family-centered care to hemodialysis patientsâ€™ families for increasing their resilience.
