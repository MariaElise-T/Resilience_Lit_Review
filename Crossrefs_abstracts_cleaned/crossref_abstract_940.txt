The energy sector is clearly operating in challenging times with uncertainty due to COVID starting in 2020, global economic collapse and the evolution of acceptability of different energy sources locally and globally. Stuart Taylor, CEO of resilience consulting firm Springfox will discuss the critical role of resilient leadership as a pathway to growth and success for shareholders, leaders and staff in the energy sector. Resilience can be defined as the learned ability to bounce back and also how to bounce forward through courage, connection and creativity. In exploring the concept of resilient leadership, Stuart Taylor will build on the foundation of resilience required by all leaders to be calm, energised, positive, optimistic and spiritually aligned. Taking this further, he will discuss the evidence and benefit of having leaders lead with empathy, trust and compassion as enablers for resilient leadership, and organisational agility and growth. Using global research undertaken by Springfox, and parent company the Resilience Institute, Stuart will provide key benchmarking results for the energy sector from the study of over 21000 staff to demonstrate a tangible return on resilience, as opposed to a return on intensity. As part of this study, a case study from an Australian energy manufacturer will be discussed that undertook to build a resilient culture using the principles outlined in this study.
