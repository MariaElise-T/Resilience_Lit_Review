SummaryIn this article, we consider the resilience analysis of the even‐based consensus control of networked Lagrangian systems under denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks, which are usually implemented by the attackers to block the communication channels. Comparing with the linear cyber‐physical systems, the secure control of the networked Lagrangian systems is more complex and challenging, especially under the conditions of asymmetry communication and discontinuous control. To this end, an event‐based controller is first designed for consensus control of networked Lagrangian systems in the absence of DoS attacks. Sufficient conditions are given to stabilize the closed‐loop systems. Then the resilience analysis is presented for the event‐based controller under DoS attacks. Some conditions associated with the DoS duration and frequency are proposed for the control parameters against the attacks. Then Zeno behaviors are proved to be nonexistent in the proposed control scheme. An algorithm is also given to guide the control design.
