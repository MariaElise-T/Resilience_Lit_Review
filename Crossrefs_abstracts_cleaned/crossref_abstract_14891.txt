Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is related to personality functioning and risk of subsequent objective cognitive impairment. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether lower neuroticism and higher conscientiousness—resilient personality traits—protect against conversion from SCD to objective cognitive impairment in two longitudinal community-based cohorts. Methods: Data from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 1,741, Mean age = 68.64 years, Follow-up mean = 7.34 years) and the National Health and Aging Trends Survey (N = 258, Mean age = 79.34 years, Follow-up mean = 4.31 years) were analyzed using Cox regression analysis, controlling for sociodemographic covariates, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and apolipoprotein ɛ4. Results: The pooled results showed that lower neuroticism and higher conscientiousness were associated with decreased risk of conversion from SCD to objective cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Among individuals with SCD, those with a resilient personality may have more cognitive and psychological reserve to maintain cognitive functioning and delay conversion to objective cognitive impairment. The findings further contribute to a better understanding of personality along the cognitive continuum: The observed effect sizes were smaller than those reported in cognitively normal individuals but larger than in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Personality could provide useful information to identify individuals with SCD who may develop objective cognitive impairment—namely those who hold a vulnerable personality (higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness).
