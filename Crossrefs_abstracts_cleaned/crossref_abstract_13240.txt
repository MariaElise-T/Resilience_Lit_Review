AbstractSocial connectedness can have a significant impact on improving individuals' mental well-being by serving as a pathway through which psychological resilience is enhanced. The objective of this study was to investigate the mediating influence of psychological resilience on the association between social connectedness and mental wellbeing among adults in Azerbaijan. A total of 519 adults, ranging from 18 to 66 years old and representing various regions in Azerbaijan, participated in the research. They completed measures including the Social Connectedness Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings from the SEM demonstrated that psychological resilience played a significant mediating role in the relationship between social connectedness and mental wellbeing among Azerbaijani adults. Specifically, when accounting for age and gender, it was observed that psychological resilience partially mediated the link between social connectedness and mental wellbeing. Thus, social connectedness emerges as a crucial factor in promoting individuals' mental well-being by fostering psychological resilience.
