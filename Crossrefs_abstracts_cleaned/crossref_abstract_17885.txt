AbstractPurpose/objectivesThis study explored key mental health measures as self‐reported by pre‐doctoral dental students enrolled in all four years of dental school and their relationships with a year in school and resilience.MethodsThis study utilized archival data from the National Collegiate Health Assessment (NCHA) survey administered in Fall 2020. This instrument is a compilation of validated measures assessing a broad spectrum of health‐related behaviors, including nutrition, substance use, social relationships, and mental health. The mental health measures explored in this study included validated scales assessing mental distress, suicide behavior risk, psychological well‐being, and resilience.ResultsStudents in all 4 years of dental school completed the survey (62% response rate). Most students reported high resilience, positive psychological well‐being, and moderate mental distress, with mental health challenges spiking in the D2 and D3 years. Resilience emerged as a protective factor for student mental health. Years in school did not retain a significant impact on mental health when controlling for resilience.ConclusionsResilience is important in bolstering dental students' mental health. Dental students’ mental health challenges increased during the D2 and D3 years. Dental educators may positively influence student well‐being by taking measures that foster resilience at the beginning of and midway through dental school.
