Summary
Background
Parental bereavement during childhood is associated with an elevated risk for the development of psychiatric problems. This paper seeks to provide insight into the adjustment process of trizygotic triplets dealing with their father’s death, thus, trying to give an impression of the individual nature of grief and resilience.

Methods
We examined 11-year-old trizygotic triplets (2 boys and 1 girl) concerning behavioral problems (CBCL/6-18R, YSR/11-18R), posttraumatic stress disorder (UCLA PTSD Index for DSM‑5, UPID), depression (“Depressionsinventar für Kinder und Jugendliche,” DIKJ), and fear (“Phobiefragebogen für Kinder und Jugendliche,” PHOKI) shortly after their father’s death and 6 months later. The girl was developmentally delayed and had moderate intellectual disability, while her brothers’ development was age-appropriate.

Results
The triplets showed very different adjustment to the traumatic event. While the boys showed less psychopathological response to their loss shortly after their father’s death and adjusted physiologically during the following 6 months, their sister scored high in almost all dimensions and still presented with notable psychopathological symptoms at the 6‑month follow-up.

Conclusion
Outcomes differ distinctly despite objectively equal risk and protective factors. While it is known that above average intellectual abilities represent a protective factor for posttraumatic stress, these results show that intellectual retardation might be a prominent yet understudied risk factor in dealing with postbereavement psychopathology in children.
