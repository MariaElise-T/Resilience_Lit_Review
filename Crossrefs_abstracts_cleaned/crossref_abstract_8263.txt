AbstractThis study compares resilience‐based organizing with efficiency‐based organizing and argues that the former can significantly improve the sustainability of firms in the midst of environmental changes. Based on the comparison, I claim that resilience‐based organizing exhibits paradoxical properties of change and stability and suggest that balancing this paradox pushes firms to self‐organize during environmental changes while protecting their core business functioning. Specifically, drawing upon systems ecologist's perspective on resilience, this study describes the self‐adaptive process that helps firms manage the trade‐off between change and stability. I then elaborate how resilience‐based organizing ensures the establishment of processes that are integral to the achievement of long‐term outcomes and adaptability, which is relatively obscured in efficiency‐based organizing.
