 A literature review was conducted to examine the role of spirituality with resiliency in the pediatric workplace. Two themes emerged from the literature review: healthcare practitioners desire to have a sense of belonging at work and the utilization of chaplains is helpful. This study aims to discover how practitioners experience spiritual health in the workplace and identify interventions that enhance resiliency with the challenges of pediatrics. Implications from this study are applied to chaplaincy and research.
