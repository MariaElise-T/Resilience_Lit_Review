Resilient underlayments are commonly utilized as a primary method of reducing footfall noise in architectural acoustics. Although resiliency is a large component of a partition’s footfall performance, as well its ability to achieve higher AIIC ratings through ASTM E1007 AIIC testing, adding resiliency alone does not always address all of the frequencies which cause disturbances due to footfall. Particularly in lightweight construction, the density of the configuration is also a critical component of a successful solution. Due to the lack of sufficient mass in lightweight construction materials, successful treatment for impact noise disturbances in lightweight conditions becomes more difficult to achieve. This paper compares data with different flooring configurations in mock-up ASTM AIIC testing conditions in order to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of ANISPL (Absorption Normalized Impact Sound Pressure Level) performance in different frequencies. Resiliency and density are added in varying combinations in a wood frame construction in order to better understand their relationship to AIIC ratings and a partition’s success in impact noise insulation.
