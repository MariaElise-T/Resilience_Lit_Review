AbstractAimDisturbance of urinary function is a common complication after rectal cancer surgery, and it may affect patients' psychological well‐being, consequently may develop post‐traumatic stress disorder. Personal resilience might increase people's ability to manage life's challenges. However, limited study to explore their relationships. This study examined the relationships among lower urinary symptoms, resilience, and post‐traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in post‐surgery patients with rectal cancer.MethodsA cross‐sectional study design was used and included 188 patients with diagnosed rectal cancer who had undergone surgery over 24 months and were recruited from a hospital in southern Taiwan. The outcome measurements included a resilience scale, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the Chinese Davidson Trauma Scale, personal characteristics, and disease‐related variables.ResultsThere were significant relationships among age at diagnosed, self‐reported physical status, perceived satisfied with recovery, urinary tract symptoms, resilience, and overall PTSS. The stepwise regression demonstrated that five factors, self‐reported physical status, resilience, urinary tract symptoms, age at diagnosed and gender, and together explained 27.7% of overall PTSS variance (10.7, 6.7, 3.7, 4.8 and 1.8% of variance, respectively).ConclusionThe study demonstrates that patients with diagnosed rectal cancers long‐term outcomes of PTSS, urinary tract symptoms, and resilience after surgery; in addition, self‐reported physical status, resilience, urinary tract symptoms, age at diagnosed and gender are the major predictors of PTSS. A better understanding of the long‐term outcomes of post‐surgery in rectal cancer patients and its related factors may help to decreasing the PTSS after surviving cancer.
