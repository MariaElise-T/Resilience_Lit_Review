 Difficult social circumstances contribute to numerous problems among Latino youth, which can include risky behaviors, school disengagement, health disparities, and relatively high rates of unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS. To promote health and healthy development in spite of exposure to substantial social challenge, it is important to identify factors that contribute to resilience among Latino youth. We examine focus group data from the ¡Encuentro! study (10 youth groups, four parent groups) to learn elements identified by Latino youth and parents that support adolescents in reaching their goals. Honoring principles of community-based participatory research, a community–university analysis team coded data for emerging themes and identified protective factors within Masten’s resilience framework. All individual, social, and sociocultural protective factors in Masten’s framework were evident, including positive cultural standards, rituals, relationships, and supports. Challenges to resilience specific to Latino youth included prejudice and discrimination related to race/ethnicity and immigration.
