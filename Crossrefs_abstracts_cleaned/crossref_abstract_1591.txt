 The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented stress and uncertainty, particularly among vulnerable populations such as healthcare workers who are facing a multitude of current and looming economic and psychosocial stressors. As clinician-scientists delivering mind-body interventions in our hospital, we suggest applying evidence-based mind-body techniques that promote resiliency and adaptive coping during these difficult times. Interventions that package a variety of mind-body skills into one cohesive program, such as the Stress Management and Resiliency Training â€“ Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP), offer promise for meeting the variety of stress management needs (e.g., health concerns, isolation) present during the COVID-19 pandemic. From our work with frontline healthcare clinicians and other caregiver populations, we offer recommendations for adapting the delivery, modality, and content of mind-body practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest key skills for promoting resiliency and buffering against the future stressors that lie ahead for everyone.
