Abstract
Over a year into the war in Ukraine, BCS spoke to experts from IT Ukraine Association and the UK about what we have learned about IT resilience, what Ukraine is still able to offer, and the implications for the role of IT technology in society. The webinar was chaired by Brian Runciman MBCS, BCS' Head of Content and Insight.
