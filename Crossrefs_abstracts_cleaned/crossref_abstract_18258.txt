Cultural awareness in peacekeeping operations is gaining traction, particularly among academics, to eradicate the resulting conflict through ideas, points of view, or policies. These policies can identify specific strategies to help each operation succeed. Culture awareness applies not only to peacekeepers but also to their families. This study employs a qualitative approach with data and literature sources on The Importance of Peacekeeper Training and Family Resilience in Conflict Resolution. Peacekeepers use a variety of strategies to reduce the likelihood of cultural clashes. The author approaches pre-deployment training with tolerance and objectivity in all decisions, inter-group coordination, inter-group communication, and inter-group planning. These materials can help people understand UN peacekeeping operationsâ€™ fundamental principles, values, and protocols. These principles can guide peacekeepers and their families as they assist countries in transitioning from war to peace. The impact of culture on the success or failure of conflict resolution processes utilized in peacekeeping deployments has been substantial. To preserve their effectiveness as a tool for resolving modern conflicts, peacekeeping operations must make extraordinary efforts to address cultural challenges at all levels of interpersonal interaction and throughout the implementation process
