The purpose of this study is to examine the psychological resilience of athletes who are dealing with different sports teams. 300 hundred male athletes ( football; 80, volleyball 80, basketball; 80, and handball; 60) who involved in different sports teams with at least five years of regular training history were included in the study. The psychological resilience scale developed by Friborget al. (2003) was used to determine the psychological resilience of the subjects. SPSS 22.0 program was used in the statistical analysis of the study. When the results of the study were examined, no statistically significant difference was found in the psychologic durability levels of the athletes dealing with the fields of football, basketball, volleyball, and handball (p>0.05). As a result, it was observed that male athletes dealing with different kinds of team sports had similar psychological resilience levels. It is thought that this is due to the fact that all athletes adapt themselves to the needs of their branches with extra motivation for success and for proving their talents within the team for success.
