Background:
Resilience is important for undergraduate nursing students. However, little is known about resilience for postqualification nursing students who return for graduate studies. The purpose of this study was to explore the process of resilience for nursing students in graduate programs.


Method:
Postqualification nursing students were interviewed once to learn about their experiences in graduate education in this grounded theory study. Ten participants formed a convenience sample that was voluntarily recruited through a research course.


Results:
Participants described their process of resilience as one of managing challenges that was facilitated by passion and support. Participants applied several metacognitive and practical strategies. In addition, participants reported that they enjoyed or struggled through their studies (often both in varying degrees). The participants' resilience strategies reflected the application of prior learning.


Conclusion:

              The process of resilience for postqualification students can be outlined in a theoretical process centered on managing challenges. Educators can support resilience by providing support and enabling resilience strategies. [
