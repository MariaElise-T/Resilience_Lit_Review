The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the educational system worldwide because of the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic for the purpose of impeding the fast spread of the virus. Educational institutions and people around the world worked intensively to create contingency plans that ensured the quality and continuity of the educational system. The ability to cope with the new changes in the educational environment varied since it depended on the available technologies and level of social restrictions, among other factors. This paper aims to investigate the literature on the educational system during the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on (1) the challenges faced by students and educators during the learning process, (2) the strategies used to overcome such challenges, and (3) the roles of educational institutions and parents. Two databases were selected in this review: Scopus and Web of Science. There were five stages in the identification, screening, and assessment of the eligibility of papers, whereby 87papers were selected to be analyzed. Opportunities to ensure the continuity and quality of learning are highlighted, and a framework is derived from the literature to achieve enhanced and more resilient online educational systems. By including multiple educational levels, potential research gaps can be identified, highlighting the need for further investigation and exploration in specific educational domainsâ€”e.g., addressing behavioral, procedural, and technological challenges requires a thorough examination to achieve optimal solutions and implement reforms.
