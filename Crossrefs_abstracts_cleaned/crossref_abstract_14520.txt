 Resilient railpads in a variety of materials and with different surface profiling have been tested in the laboratory and in track. A laboratory impact test based on that initially developed at the Battelle Columbus Laboratories provides a reliable ranking of the extent to which railpads attenuate dynamic strain in concrete sleepers in track. The test is also a good indication of the average attenuation provided by a pad in track. If dynamic loads in track are particularly severe the fractional attenuation provided by a pad is greater than that indicated by the laboratory impact test.  Laboratory resonance apparatus, in which the pad is the principal resilient element in a simple dynamic system, has been made to find the railpad's effective dynamic stiffness. There is good correlation between the stiffness measured in track and that measured in this apparatus.  A pad's dynamic stiffness is consistently at least as great as its tangent stiffness found from the static load/deflection curve. The load/deflection behaviour of a pad in track can be found from measurements in an assembly of rail and sleeper in the laboratory.
