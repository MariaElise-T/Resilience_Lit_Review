BACKGROUND: Recent studies concerning supply chain management have shown that topics such as supply chain risk management (SCRM) and supply chain resilience (SCRes) are the new trends in supply chain management. Initial studies in the early 2000s developed frameworks to identify, measure and mitigate risks and assess/evaluate the degree of resilience of a company or supply chain. Recently, a large variety of studies has emerged, including more conceptual and review studies as well as more sophisticated, quantitative studies. However, studies on human-related factors are still lacking, and there is no systematic method to answer questions such as “What literature is available concerning human factors related to SCRM and SCRes?”, “Which human factors contribute to SCRes?” and “Which human factor can amplify SC Risks?” OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to identify human factors that impact supply chain resilience and supply chain risk management. METHOD: This study was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. The objective of using this review protocol is to ensure that the review has the minimum amount of bias due to research expectations. RESULTS: This study highlighted a summary of human-related risk and resilience factors as well as a discussion about these preliminary findings. CONCLUSIONS: As our main conclusion, we highlight that human factors may generate significant risks in the supply chain, nevertheless, there are other human factors that must be nourished to obtain SCRes.
