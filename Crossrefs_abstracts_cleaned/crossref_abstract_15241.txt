Abstract
Background
This study aimed to determine the effect of telephone counseling based on Orem’s Self-Care Model on adherence to treatment and resilience of patients with coronary angioplasty.

Methods
This randomized clinical trial was performed on 80 patients in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 40 (intervention and control). Questionnaires on adherence to treatment of chronic patients and resilience for patients with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were filled out before and 8 weeks after the intervention. In the intervention group, the telephone call schedule consisted of three calls per week for 8 weeks.

Results
Before the intervention, no significant difference was found between the groups about adherence to treatment and resilience. However, after the intervention, a significant difference was found between the groups as to adherence to treatment and resilience (P < 0.001).

Conclusion
Nursing consultation using telephone calls based on Orem’s model increases the adherence to treatment and resilience of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Telephone counseling can help the patients adhere to their treatment plans and develop resilience skills.
