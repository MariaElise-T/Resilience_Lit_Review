Abstract
In view of the current situation that the resilience of information systems cannot be accurately assessed, the key metrics that affect the resilience of information systems—the overall system capability, the system’s maximum absorptive capacity, the system recovery ability and the system recovery ratio, are established. And the paper shows data calculation model of the key metrics. Finally, the information system resilience analysis method is proposed, and an aerospace simulation system is taken as an example, combined with its dual redundancy and non-redundancy mechanism to test and verify, which provides strong support for the analysis of system resilience ability.
