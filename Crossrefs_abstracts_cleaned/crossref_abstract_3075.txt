Background:The recently described optimized Oxford skeletal maturity system utilizes anteroposterior (AP) hip radiographs to accurately, rapidly, and reliably estimate skeletal maturity. However, in the real-world setting, significant positional variation in AP hip radiographs may influence the accuracy of optimized Oxford skeletal age estimates. We sought to evaluate the consistency of skeletal age estimations using the optimized Oxford system between differently rotated radiographs.Methods:Thirty normal computerized tomography scans of males (15 children, 9 to 15 y) and females (15 children, 8 to 14 y) were obtained retrospectively, converted into 3D reconstructions, and then used to produce simulated hip radiographs in five different rotational positions. The optimized Oxford system was applied to the 150 simulated AP hip radiographs (5 differently rotated views of 30 hips) to produce a skeletal age estimate for each.Results:Rotational position did not have a statistically significant effect on the skeletal age (P=0.84) using 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Of the 5 radiographic parameters in the optimized Oxford system, only greater trochanter height showed significant rotational variation after Greenhouse-Geisser correction (F2.58, 74.68=5.98,P<0.001). However, post hoc analyses showed that the greater trochanter height obtained at the most centered position was not different from the other 4 rotational positions (P>0.05 for all).Conclusion:The optimized Oxford skeletal maturity system is resilient to rotational variation. Mildly to moderately rotated radiographs obtained in the modern clinical setting can be used for skeletal age estimation by this method, broadening the clinical usage of this system.Level of Evidence:Level III—diagnostic study.
