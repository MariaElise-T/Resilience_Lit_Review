 The Clergy Resilience Model is a theoretical framework with a systemic perspective that is useful to denominations, individual clerics, and therapists in supporting clergy resilience and well-being. This article describes the development of this framework specific to clergy. As there is limited literature on the nature of clergy resilience or the specific variables that enable clergy to positively adapt to the challenges and adversity they face, the Clergy Resilience Model provides a useful framework to begin to understand clergy resilience as a dynamic process. The Clergy Resilience Model highlights the balance between adversity clergy encounter and supportive resources they have access to, as well as the overarching influence of key spiritual factors on clergy resilience. The Clergy Resilience Model was developed as a tool that may help clergy resilience both on an individual and systemic level by creating awareness of critical factors.
