AbstractThis study aims to investigate the sources of resilience for logistics operations as it relates to food supply chains and their responses during natural disasters and other disruptions. The literature tends to treat inherent and adaptive resilience as somewhat separate constructs. Thus, this study also aims to provide some insights into the relatively underexamined area of how inherent resilience synergistically works with adaptive resilience to maintain flows for food supply chains in a developing economy context. To address the research aim, two supply chain wide case studies were used to investigate the contribution of logistic activities toward the resilience of foods supply chains in two different South Asian regions. This context was selected as these regions are prone to frequent natural disruptions and other disruptions, and these food supply chains also play a crucial role in economy and providing relief supplies to their communities. Logistics operations play a key role in achieving overall supply chain resilience. The sources of inherent resilience are the network structure, buffer capacity, and strong social connections among the actors. Adaptive resilience is derived from transportation flows, storage, information sharing, and demand management processes. Surprisingly, resilience in this context is achieved despite the relatively low level of integration, an unsophisticated technological landscape and compromised logistics infrastructure. Still, resilience can be enhanced further. This study contributes to the sparse literature that examines logistics activities that influence the resilience of food supply chains in the context of natural disasters and other disruptions. Furthermore, uncovering the substructure of logistics resilience activities, and surprisingly, the synergies between inherent and adaptive resilience, adds to the emerging body of literature.
