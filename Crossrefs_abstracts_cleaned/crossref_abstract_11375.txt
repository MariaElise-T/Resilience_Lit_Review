The wavering nature of environmental conditions caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and agricultural practices has resulted in global warming, a significant increase in average temperature, deepened by increasingly intensive agriculture, deforestation and increased use of fossil fuels. This often-unsafe anthropogenic interference with the environment has resulted in climate change with many negative impacts, such as, extreme weather phenomena, drought, fires, death of animal and plant species, and disruptions of food chain and destruction of agricultural resources. Therefore, there is a need to embrace environmentally sound crop management innovations to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture in the post-pandemic era. To sustain food security propelled by crop management innovations, climate smart agriculture (CSA) and climate resilient sustainable agriculture (CRSA) have to be employed. There is a need for agriculturists to develop crop management innovations that will tackle climate change negative impacts on man, animal and environment by leveraging more on technological innovations through scientific research. Access to good and affordable food products is important to boost herd immune and combat this COVID-19 virus spread within the population. This could only be realized by ensuring proper adaptation of agricultural production to the impacts of the prevailing and imminent climate change scenarios in the post-pandemic era.
