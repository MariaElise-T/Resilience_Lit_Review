Abstract Indicators of violence involving public transportation have reached alarming levels in most Brazilian states, hampering mobility. This article aims to identify the level of vulnerability and resilience of public transportation in 21 administrative regions of the city of Rio de Janeiro, in light of criminal occurrences. Variables related to population, employment, intervening opportunities, travel time, criminal occurrences associated with public transportation and police coverage of each evaluated region were used. The results indicated that the five most vulnerable regions are Campo Grande, Méier, Barra da Tijuca, Rio Comprido and Irajá, and the most resilient are Lagoa, Copacabana, Botafogo, Vila Isabel and Tijuca. The contribution of this work is the proposal to analyze the level of vulnerability and resilience based on public security data, with emphasis on the spatial dependence relation among the regions.
