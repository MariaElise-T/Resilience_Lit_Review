Factors influencing fishers’ lives are climate change and extreme change in local weather. Climate change and extreme weather conditions are expected to affect marine fisheries’ productivity and modify fish distribution because of changes in water temperature, ocean currents, and other oceanic conditions. Both are issues faced by fishers in Natuna. The purpose of this study was to identify climate and weather changes in the research location, investigate the socio-economic effects, and analyse fishers’ adaptability patterns in relation to climate change. The method used in this study includes surveys, questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. The results reveal climate change, and extreme weather affects the socio-economic dynamics of fishers in the Natuna Islands. The socio-economic dynamics as fishers’ resilience towards extreme climate are done by adjusting the number of workers and workforce, adjusting the size of fishing boats/ships, adjusting the composition of fishing gears, and changing fishing grounds. Keywords: Resilience, fishermen, climate change, Natuna, South China Sea
