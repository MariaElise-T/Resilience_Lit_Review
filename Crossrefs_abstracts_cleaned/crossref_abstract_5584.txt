Background and Objective: Resilience refers to a protective factor that reduces stress in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Given the significance of this issue, the present research aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) in PwMS.
Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of CD-RISC in the statistical population of Guilan MS Society (GMSS). In this study, 442 people with MS participated and responded to CD-RISC in an online survey. The data were analyzed in SPSS (version 23) and Amos (version 21) software packages.
Results: The confirmatory factor analysis results of the first stage with five factors revealed that 25 CD-RISC items benefited from high factor load and good fit indices were reported (ꭕ2=605.55; df=265; P-Value=.0001; ꭕ2/df=2.28; GFI=.88; CFI=.93; TLI=.92; RMR=.06; RMSEA=.05); therefore, CD-RISC has good construct validity. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the whole scale and subscales were calculated at 0.94 and 0.71-0.89, respectively, indicating the optimal reliability of CD-RISC in PwMS.
Conclusions: The current study presented evidence for CD-RISC validity and reliability. Further studies are recommended to ensure the psychometric properties of this scale in other chronic patients.
