This research explores how Colombian refugees have manifested resilience in their resettlement and integration process in New Zealand. This study recruited 13 former Colombian refugees who were resettled in New Zealand from Ecuador, where they were recognised as refugees by the government of Ecuador and with the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). One reason for conducting this investigation was the lack of academic research on Colombian refugees in New Zealand, and to explore how they manifest resilience after their resettlement in New Zealand. But also, to contribute to the development of research on Colombian refugees in New Zealand and to contribute to all New Zealand refugee organisations with their resettlement and integration programmes in the country. Oral history and ethnography are the methodologies used in this study.Â  12 semi-structured oral history interviews were conducted with the participants. One focus group was also conducted, and four participants presented their written diaries. The findings of this research showed that the resilience demonstrated by Colombian refugees in New Zealand has been the key to overcoming the challenges of integration in the country, mainly the lack of English, mental health problems, discrimination, and unemployment.
