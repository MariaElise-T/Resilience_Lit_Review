Introduction: The importance of spirituality and spiritual growth in humans has been increasingly sought after by psychologists and mental health professionals over the last few decades. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between aggression and resilience with the mediating role of spirituality in students using the method of structural equations.
Materials and Methods: The present study is a descriptive - analytic study using structural equation method. The statistical population consisted of all students studying at the Associate and Bachelor level of Ilam University of Applied Sciences in the academic year of 2017-2018. Participants in the study were 200 people who were stratified by random sampling. Data collection tools were demographic characteristics, Buss and Perry aggression, spirituality assessment, resiliency of Connor and Davidson. Data were analyzed using path analysis and structural equations using PLS software.
 
Results: Among the 200 participants, 182 (91%) completed the questionnaires. There was a significant and positive correlation between spirituality and resilience (r =154% r= 03%). Also, there was a negative and non-significant relationship between aggression with resiliency (r = - 122% p = 10). In addition, there was no significant correlation between the amount of aggression and spirituality (r =% 05, p = 0.94). Based on the results of this research, the model of spirituality and aggression can predict about 20% of the variations in the degree of resilience in students. Accordingly, the results of structural equations of spirituality reduce aggression and thus increase the amount of resilience (r = -0.102).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed the effect of spirituality on increasing the level of resilience,  also it was showed that spirituality has a positive mediator role between aggression and resiliency.
