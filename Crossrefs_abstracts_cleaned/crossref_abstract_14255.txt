Abstract
Integrated operations (IO) is an ongoing change process in the oil and gas industry. New technological opportunities enable working in new ways that involve an integration of onshore and offshore personnel. This paper analyzes the results of two rounds of data gathering in an onshore drilling support center, in terms of the development of resilience. The first round took place in 2004/2005 and the second in 2012. This study presents a framework for the analysis of resilience and has used the case company as a mean of testing the framework. Our findings indicate that the support center has taken a huge step in the direction of becoming more resilient. The drilling company has tested a number of designs and sizes of support centers, each of which has different pros and cons. For the drilling discipline to develop resilience, it is essential that the number of rigs supported by a center is not too large, as they must not become involved in too many rigs and drilling operations. Our findings also indicate that the suggested framework provides a good overall picture of the development of resilience in the case company.
