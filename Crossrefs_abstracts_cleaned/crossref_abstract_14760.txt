This paper examines the resilience of Canadian cities to the 2020 economic crisis that followed the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. It specifically investigates the resistance and recoverability (i.e., very short‐term recovery) dimensions of resilience. It reveals that Canadian cities exhibited heterogeneous resiliency to the crisis, resulting in economic restructuring. Further, the paper decomposed resilience into an industrial mix effect and local‐specific effect using a shift‐share analysis, to move away from the industrial‐structure dominated focus in the resilience literature by examining the influence of local‐specific effects. The analysis found that local‐specific effects played a dominant role in determining the resiliency of cities, while their industrial mix had a marginal influence. Moreover, the determinants of resilience are complex having different effects and functions depending on the dimension of resilience under examination. Also, the determinants of resilience may change depending on the type of shock cities experience. A key policy implication is that localities' capabilities largely determine their resilience.
