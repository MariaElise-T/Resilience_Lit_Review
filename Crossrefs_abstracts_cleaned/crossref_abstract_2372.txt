The purpose of this study was to examine musical parenting for resilience in young children and how popular music, especially, was an essential resource for the families raising them. To address this question, I implemented a longitudinal interview study with five families with children attending kindergarten in the United States. Qualitative data analysis showed that parents used popular music intuitively and deliberately to teach their children resilience skills. Specifically, it played a central role in the childrenâ€™s emotional and social development, strengthening family relationships and creating family coherence, all implicated in developing healthy resilience.
