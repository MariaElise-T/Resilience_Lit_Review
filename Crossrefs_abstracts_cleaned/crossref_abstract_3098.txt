Bituminous mixes are becoming increasingly important in the road industry. The road engineers identify rutting as a major source of distress in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements. The Asphalt Mix Design Marshal method adequately addresses the aggregate and asphalt binder properties that contribute to permanent deformation. However, there is no laboratory test currently at hand to quickly predict permanent deformation susceptibility of HMA. The main purpose of this paper is to provide practical information of laboratory samples for practitioners and mix designers. Thus, relevant test procedures and results of tests conducted are reported in this paper. Two resilient behaviours of cracked sealed asphalt concrete were studied by varying temperature and time of loading to understand the crack sealed pavement behaviour under Iran conditions.
