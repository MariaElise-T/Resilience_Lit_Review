This study constructs a framework for evaluating urban spatial resilience based on five dimensions: scale, intensity, morphology, function, and benefit. Likewise, it empirically analyzes the spatial differences and influencing factors of urban spatial resilience in the Harbin–Changchun urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020. Overall, the spatial resilience of the Harbin–Changchun urban agglomeration declined from 2000 to 2019. In addition, its ability to resist external disturbances weakened. The five dimensions of spatial resilience declined. However, urban spatial morphological resilience slightly increased. The spatial diversity of the Harbin–Changchun urban agglomeration is obvious, implying that the spatial resilience of cities in the central region, mainly in Suihua and Songyuan, is higher than in peripheral areas of the urban agglomeration, mostly in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Siping, and Qiqihar. The period between 2000 and 2019 was dominated by cities with fluctuating spatial resilience. Furthermore, urban spatial resilience is influenced by a combination of factors, with economic support being the primary one. The selection of the urban spatial resilience research index system in this study is more spatially oriented and more accurately reflects the urban spatial resilience situation, which, in turn, provides a new planning perspective for urban planning in China.
