Changes in the resistance, recovery, and resilience of three desert riparian ecosystems to extreme droughts and the influence of ecological characteristics on them from 2000 to 2020 were analyzed within the Tarim River Basin, Xinjiang, China. The results showed that: (1) The resistance of the Populus euphratica forest community was the highest among the three plant communities. The recovery and resilience of the shrub community were the highest; (2) the resilience increased the most for the shrub community and decreased slightly for the Populus euphratica forest and herb communities as hydrological droughts waned; (3) the relative height and density significantly increased for Populus euphratica, decreased for herbs, and did not change for shrubs from 2000 to 2020; (4) the diversity indexes did not significantly change for the Populus euphratica forest and herb communities, and they increased for the shrub community from 2000 to 2020; (5) the resistance and resilience of the Populus euphratica forest, shrub, and herb communities were significantly affected by ecological characteristics, especially the Margalef richness index; and (6) the shrub community is more likely to rapidly recover (that is an increase of cover, height, and density) from future droughts in the Tarim River Basin, particularly with the implementation of new and more effective ecological restoration projects.
