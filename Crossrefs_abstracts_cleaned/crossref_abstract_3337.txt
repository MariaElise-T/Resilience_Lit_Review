Floor impact sound is one noise in apartment houses that cannot be avoided. In order to reduce floor impact sound, a floating floor system using resilient materials has been generally applied. Floor impact sound insulation performance of the floating floor system is dependent on the physical property (dynamic stiffness) of resilient materials. This study investigated the effect of temperature changes on resilient materials used in the floating floor system and on dynamic stiffness. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) were used as resilient materials, and dynamic stiffness was measured during three stages of temperature change condition. The measurement result showed that as the temperature decreased, dynamic stiffness also increased. This study also analyzed the effect of changes in outdoor temperature on the heavyweight impact sound level with respect to concrete buildings with wall slabs. The floor impact sound level tended to increase during the winter season, when the outdoor temperature was low.
