The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of supply chain risk management on supply chain resilience in the presence of Internet-of-Things as an intermediate variable. In other words, the study seeks to identify whether supply chain risk management completely affects supply chain resilience. Collecting data by a questionnaire from a sample composed of managers of Jordanian industrial firms, the results show that supply chain risk management has a direct and indirect effect on supply chain resilience through Internet-of-Things. These results do not support the hypothesis that supply chain risk management completely affects supply chain resilience and accepted the hypothesis that Internet-of-Things intervenes the effect of supply chain risk management on supply chain resilience. The study contributes to the literature through filling a research gap regarding the mediating role of Internet-of-Things in the relationship between supply chain risk management and supply chain resilience and contributes to the industry through instructing managers to adopt technologies such as Internet-of-Things to help their firms cope with supply chain risks.
