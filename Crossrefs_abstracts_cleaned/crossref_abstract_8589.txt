Abstract
Although Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) is a relatively recent concept, it can provide effective means for cities worldwide to become more sustainable and to enhance urban resilience, thus improving the quality of life of their citizens. Moreover, cost-effective NBS can help improve the urban environment in multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhoods, from public spaces to peri-urban areas, providing all kinds of co-benefits positively influencing the above-mentioned challenges. Depending on the context and the need, many different stakeholders may be involved in the co-creation of systemic, inclusive and locally attuned NBS supporting social cohesion and urban equality.
The learning alliance fostered by the EU-Brazil Sector Dialogue on NBS, is currently working together to identify common research and innovation agendas for cooperation, as well as mapping relevant examples of successful NBS that have been recently implemented or are under development in both Europe and Brazil. The cases selected have been studied and compared with a particular emphasis on their potential for replicability, scalability and adaptation to the local context. In addition, they should address the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, socio-cultural and economic.
Therefore, this paper discusses the opportunities offered by NBS (even in periods of economic downturn), but also the limiting factors hindering their wider dissemination. In addition, it will present through a few inspiring case studies from both regions, clear examples of successful implementation of NBS, which could be replicated and scaled in other locations in response to specific local conditions.
