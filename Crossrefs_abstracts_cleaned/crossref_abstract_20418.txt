AbstractRefugee and immigrant populations experience many pre‐ and post‐migration risk factors and stressors that can negatively impact their mental health. This qualitative study aimed to explore the system‐level issues that affect the access to, as well as quality and outcomes of mental health care for immigrants and refugees, with a particular focus on challenges in the continuity of patient care. A multidisciplinary group of health providers, including nurses, identified six themes including (i) perceived access to care; (ii) coordination amongst health care providers; (iii) patient connections with community organizations; (iv) coordinated care planning; (v) organizational protocols, policies and procedures and (vi) systemic and health care training needs. Although patient resilience is seen as a pivotal way for vulnerable populations to cope with hardship, there is a clear need for creating a resilient health care system that is able to anticipate and adapt to adverse situations. The findings from this study have implications for nurses, who are uniquely positioned to advocate for public health policy that improves the continuity of health care by creating systemic resilience.
