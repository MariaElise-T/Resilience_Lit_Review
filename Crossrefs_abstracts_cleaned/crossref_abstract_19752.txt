BackgroundWomen with intellectual disability are thought to be at increased risk of mental illness, yet little is known about resiliency factors supporting women's mental health. This article reports on such factors drawn from a study that aimed to address how women with intellectual disability experience their mental health and well‐being.Materials and MethodsUtilizing a broad qualitative approach, 25 New Zealand women, aged 21–65 years were interviewed about their life from childhood to the present, including, where relevant, their experience of mental illness. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach.ResultsResiliency factors aligned with the theme ‘keeping mentally well’, subthemes of which were as follows: the importance of relationships with family and friends; keeping busy; and autonomy and happiness. Challenges for resiliency could be seen in the theme ‘mental illness’ where subthemes of abuse, long‐term stress and medication were identified.ConclusionsMany of the women demonstrated remarkable resiliency, despite setbacks and exposure to risks, provided they were nested within a supportive context. Those women who experienced major mental illness shared evidence of both higher risk factors and less support available at crucial times.
