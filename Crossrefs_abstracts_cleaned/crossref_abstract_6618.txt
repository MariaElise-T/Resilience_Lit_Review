Current research has focused on the impact of organizational resilience on a company’s ability to cope with temporary adversity, without considering its role in long-term development. This study applies the grounded theory approach to construct a theoretical model of the factors influencing organizational resilience in long-term development. The model includes six main categories: change readiness, corporate culture and values, systems thinking, social responsibility, resource–information linkages, and leadership, consisting of 47 sub-categories and 99 initial categories. The research findings indicate that all six elements—change readiness, corporate culture and values, systems thinking, social responsibility, resource–information linkages, and leadership—have a positive impact on organizational resilience. Moreover, corporate social responsibility positively influences change readiness, corporate culture and values, systems thinking, resource–information linkages, and leadership. The study also reveals a bi-directional driving mechanism between a company and its management. This research enriches the existing theoretical framework of factors influencing organizational resilience and provides valuable guidance for companies to effectively respond to developmental challenges and achieve long-term growth.
