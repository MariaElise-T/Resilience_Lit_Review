We assimilate to an opened system the city of Phnom Penh which has spread in the floodplain of the Mekong river by dikes and embankment successive. The major crisis suffered under the Khmer Rouge damaged hydraulic networks. Since 1979 through ad hoc interventions of "pioneer actors" on the networks the city-system comes into resilience, despite the occurrence of new crises. While these networks are hardly rebuilt, the high land and property speculation for years 2005-2008 leads to a densification and a verticalization of the urban fabric, which is a source of new imbalances for this system.
