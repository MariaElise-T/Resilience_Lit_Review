The mediating effect of the mother’s parenting behavior and children’s playfulness was examined in the relationship between direct and indirect effects of variables on children’s ego-resilience and mother’s play belief and children’s ego-resilience.Methods: A total of 305 children aged 3 to 5 and 305 mothers enrolled in early childhood education institutes in Gangwon-do, Gyeonggi-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Chungcheongnam-do were recruited. Structural equation modeling was conducted using the AMOS 21.0 program.Results: Results revealed that mothers’ play beliefs had a positive correlation with parenting behavior, children’s playfulness, and children’s ego-resilience, and parenting behavior had a positive correlation with children’s ego-resilience. The playfulness of children exhibited a positive correlation with the ego-resilience of children, while parenting behavior and children’s playfulness. In addition, the mother’s play beliefs, the mother’s parenting behavior, and the children’s playfulness directly affected the children’s ego-resilience, and the play beliefs indirectly influenced parenting behavior and the children’s playfulness as mediators.Conclusion: This study, verified that the mother’s play beliefs, parenting behavior, and playfulness of children had a significant effect on children’s ego-resilience. It is encouraging in that it revealed that if a mother recognizes the importance of play and supports it with a positive belief in play, children’s playfulness can be cultivated and ego-resilience can be improved.
