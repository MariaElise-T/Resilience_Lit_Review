Hence, identifying and validating risk-relevant factors that leads to superior business performance is necessary.  This study aims to validate the instrument to measure the impact of factors associated with business performance i.e., strategic leadership, business continuity planning, and resilience to disruption. This paper contributes to the literature by developing a comprehensive model that strengthens a firm’s resilience to disruption and leads to superior business performance.
