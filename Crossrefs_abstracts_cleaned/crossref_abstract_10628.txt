The southeast Iberian Peninsula is the only place in the European Community where Tetraclinis articulata (Vahl) Masters populations are native. In this area, the optimal ecological niche for this species is occupied by Pinus halepensis (Miller). The increasing intensity of extreme drought events induced by climate change causes severe declines in pine forests, while providing expansion opportunities for established Tetraclinis populations. Within the framework of the LIFE-TETRACLINIS project, a study has been designed to simulate the pine forest decline effects on the population dynamics of this protected species. This work investigates the effects of decreasing competition on T. articulata specimens with limited reproductive activity. To induce the reproductive activity of these specimens through increasing the availability of light, the surrounding pines were removed within a 15 m radius. Increased light availability was modelled using “Light Detection And Ranging” (LiDAR) data, and changes in the main reproductive parameters were registered throughout the study period. A significant increase in the reproductive population was achieved, as well as the cones produced per specimen and the recruitment. Findings obtained are promising for the habitat management in continental Europe and enhancing this forest system’s resilience to extreme drought events and climate change.
