This work presents a new approach for resilience assessment in road transport routes interrupted by natural causes (rain, earthquakes) as well as by human influence (accidents). In this way, by knowing the state of preservation of the elements located within a road, particularly bridges, it will be possible to identify which are those with the highest priority to be attended for their conservation, repair, and even replacement, thus relating the cost of maintenance and the number of people benefited. To test this methodology, a case study was proposed. The proposed systematic approach is applied in the federal highway 15 route, which is an international route that passes through seven states of Mexico, ending in Alberta Canada. The study is limited to the Michoacan state of Mexico, which corresponds to 426 kilometers. This study identified the highway bridges within the road and analyzed their deterioration, the cost of repair, and the benefited inhabitants. The most significant scenarios were obtained in terms of repair cost and people benefited, identifying which bridges have priority to be served, having a more accurate decision and distribution of adequate financial resources.
