AbstractResilient Boolean functions with high nonlinearity and good algebraic properties play an important role in designing certain stream cipher schemes. In this paper, two construction methods are proposed to obtain such functions. It is shown that a class of resilient functions with high algebraic degree and currently best known nonlinearity can be constructed by using our technique. The algebraic immunity of the constructed functions is also analyzed. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
