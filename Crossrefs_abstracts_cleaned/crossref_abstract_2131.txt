Advances in the future communication technologies and capabilities of new services in heterogeneous network systems have increased the need for modelling and analysing various aspects of both the resilience of networked systems and usability from the userâ€™s point of view. We extend the traditional network reliability theory to cover a wider scope of quality requirements and applications. The proposed method can be used to model the resilience of different structured networks, and the quality of information services. We use the term resilience to cover both the technical and quality-of-service aspects of user requirements. The modelling method is demonstrated with a use case of a multilayer communication network system. However, the method can be used to model any kind of technological network, such as wireless, sensor, and backbone networks.
