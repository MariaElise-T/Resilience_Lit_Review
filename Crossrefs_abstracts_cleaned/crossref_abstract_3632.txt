The concept of resilience of a water resource system is explored, and a few definitions are suggested and compared. These are based on the time required to pass from one system state to another and involve the passage to or from a state defined as failure. Some of the definitions involve probability of recovery from failure to some acceptable state within a specified time interval; thus the system's dynamics and standards are explicitly included.
