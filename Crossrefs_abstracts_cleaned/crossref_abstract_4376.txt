Abstract:
Environmental stresses adversely impact crop production, crop quality, and product safety.
Climate change is predicted to exacerbate the impacts of stresses on current cropping systems
with multilateral impacts on crop productivity and yield, biodiversity, soil fertility, microbial activity,
and carbon sequestration. Transforming crop production systems and developing stress and climate-
resilient crops are paramount to alleviate pervasive food and nutrition security and food safety
issues and achieve a world free from hunger and malnutrition. Modern breeding techniques have
been the key to transforming crop production systems and developing stress- and climate-resilient
crops. As a rapidly evolving technology, the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR method is a leading
choice for genome editing and a possible major contributor to solving environmental and food insecurity
issues. Here, a background on the stressors with far-reaching impacts on food security has
been provided, and the principles and advances in classical genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9) that
generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) have been reviewed. Base editing and prime editing
platforms, which are DSB- and template-free, enabling targeted base substitutions, have been discussed.
The application of such tools for trait improvement has been evaluated to develop stressresilient
crops and high-throughput mutant libraries. Recent developments in the regulatory landscape
for genome-edited crops in various countries have been examined. Finally, the challenges and
future perspectives toward crop improvement have been highlighted.
