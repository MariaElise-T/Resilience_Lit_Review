Background:
New graduate nurse job satisfaction persistently decreases at 6 months postgraduation. To prepare future nurses for career resilience, schools of nursing are implementing resilience into their curriculum.


Method:
A large Midwestern school of nursing developed and instituted small group discussions, individual assignments, and online simulations to foster career resilience in a required specialty course. The course, offered in the last year of nursing school, included 93 nursing students and a comparison group of 93 nursing students.


Results:
The intervention showed an increase in Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) scores. Online simulations were useful for classroom learning, helped students discover new ways of thinking, and increased understanding of course content. Differences in simulation techniques were found, and students reported benefitting more from faculty-guided simulations than self-guided simulations.


Conclusion:

              Nurse educators implementing resilience simulation programs can increase new graduate nurse resilience using online simulation, which is an effective technique for teaching nursing students.
