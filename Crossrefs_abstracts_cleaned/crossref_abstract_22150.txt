The purpose of this study is to identify the influence of job stress and resilience of nurses in small and medium hospitals on work-life balance. The subjects of this study were 236 nurses from 3 small and medium hospitals with less than 300 beds located in I city. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, and Multiple Regression Analysis. Work-life balance showed a statistically significant correlation with job stress(r=.31, p<.001) and resilience(r=.25, p<.001). Working department(β=.12, p=.039), position(β=.29, p<.001), number of night shift per month(β=.16, p=.012), health status(β=.24, p<.001), job stress(β=.29, p<.001) and resilience(β=-.32, p<.001) were significantly associated with factors of work-life balance. and the explanatory power of the model was found to be 37.5%. The results of this study can be used as basic data for developing programs for improving the work-life balance of nurses working in small and medium-sized hospitals.
