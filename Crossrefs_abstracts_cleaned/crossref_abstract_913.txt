In the realm of agriculture, a pressing concern remains the abiotic stresses, such as temperature fluctuation, drought, soil salinity, and heavy metal contamination. These adverse growth conditions hamper crop yields and global food security. In this review, we present a comprehensive examination of the recent advancements in utilizing genomics and transcriptomics, tools to enhance crop resilience against these stress factors. Genomics aids in the identification of genes responsive to stress, unravels regulatory networks, and pinpoints genetic variations linked to stress tolerance. Concurrently, transcriptomics sheds light on the intricate dynamics of gene expression during stress conditions, unearthing novel stress-responsive genes and signaling pathways. This wealth of knowledge shapes the development of stress-tolerant crop varieties, achieved through conventional breeding programs and state-of-the-art genetic engineering and gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, the integration of diverse omics data and functional genomics tools empowers precise manipulation of crop genomes to fortify their stress resilience. In summary, the integration of genomics and transcriptomics holds substantial promise in elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind crop stress tolerance, offering a path towards sustainable agriculture and safeguarding food security amidst shifting environmental challenges.
