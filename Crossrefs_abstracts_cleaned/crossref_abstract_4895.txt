Port resilience has become a crucial topic to achieve port sustainability. To assist ports to successfully develop policies to improve resilience, this study aims to develop a framework for measuring port resilience. This paper conceptualizes the framework to assess port resilience based on relevant literature by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis using 199 samples collected from port stakeholders in South Korea. As a result, it is validated that the framework is a multi-hierarchical structure based on nine factors, i.e., robustness, redundancy, visibility, flexibility, collaboration, agility, information sharing, response, and recovery. Our findings would serve as a theoretical footstep for further studies on the relations between port resilience and sustainability and also contribute to implement policies to strengthen port resilience.
