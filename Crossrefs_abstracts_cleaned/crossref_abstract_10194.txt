It is beyond dispute that the effects of climate change can be experienced more frequently at all parts of the ecosystem. The current change of our environment contributes to unpredictable natural disasters, which results increased number of children victims by human trafficking in the devastated areas, that mostly affected the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. As the overwhelming natural disasters destroy the education system and other social services, human traffickers may take their victims easily for mainly sexual exploitation. The resilience-based methods can produce solutions to this global challenge and reduce vulnerability and risk concerning the orphaned by natural disasters who can easily become exploited persons by human traffickers. The aim of the study is introducing and analysing the Geneva Convention that should be the essential frame of the resilience-based approach of human trafficking.
