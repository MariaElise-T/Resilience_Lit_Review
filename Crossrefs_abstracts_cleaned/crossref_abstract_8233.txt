Purpose
For the purpose of applied research, we are interested in deriving and measuring multi-level future resilience, from a human capital perspective. This paper aims to set the theoretical foundations for a future resilience index to be launched in 2020.


Design/methodology/approach
Based on a review of the literature on individual, organisational and socio-ecological resilience, the researcher has distilled 10 elements of future resilience. These were elaborated into a 20-question index, which has been piloted with an anonymous organisation.


Findings
The 10 elements of future resilience, which the index will seek to measure include: emergency preparedness; creative adaptability; technological empowerment; dynamic employability; diversity cultivation; participative governance; systemic responsiveness; resource efficiency; purposeful motivation; and well-being orientation. Illustrative findings from the pilot show that organisational support for resilience across all 10 categories is seen as weaker than individualsâ€™ perception of their own level of resilience.


Practical implications
The areas of strong versus weak performance revealed by the index, either individually or in terms of organisational support, give organisations a clear set of priorities for follow-up.


Social implications
This paper has demonstrated that future resilience is a highly relevant and useful concept for society, organisations and individuals in these rapidly changing times.


Originality/value
Through the future resilience index, being developed by Antwerp Management School in collaboration with Randstad, this paper wants to encourage behaviours and capacities amongst employees that will increase resilience at the individual, organisational and socio-ecological levels. This is the first multi-level resilience measurement instrument aimed at human capital measurement.
