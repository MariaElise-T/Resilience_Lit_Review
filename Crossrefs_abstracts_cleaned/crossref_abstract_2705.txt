Where does the responsibility for resilience lie? Is it with the midwife? Does the midwife have to develop defenses and reserves in order to protect themselves from the very work they are trained for and, in some cases, from the colleagues who should be supporting them? Or is there another, more sustainable answer to the pressures and risks such as horizontal violence perpetuated in a climate of increased workload and expectation? This article considers these issues and looks at resilience and horizontal violence through a lens of collective socio-ecological responsibility.
