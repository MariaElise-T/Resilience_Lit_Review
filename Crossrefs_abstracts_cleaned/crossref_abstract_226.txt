In 2017, the Texas General Land Office (GLO) released the first Texas Coastal Resiliency Master Plan, an ambitious coastal planning effort to restore, enhance and protect more than 367 miles of coast and some 3,300 miles of bays and estuaries for the State of Texas. The lynchpin of the planning effort is its emphasis on shoring up the coast by using the latest coastal technology backed by research on Texas coastal environments, coastal hydrodynamics and morphology, and sediment supply, among others, in conjunction with federal, public, and private entity coordination. By championing a statewide Plan to guide the future of coastal management, the GLO will assure that Texas continues to restore, enhance, and protect its coastlines and communities.
