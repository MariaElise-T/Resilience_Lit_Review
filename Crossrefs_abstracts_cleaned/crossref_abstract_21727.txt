AbstractIn order to develop future academic-professional skills and later social and financial independence, an adequate adolescent school adjustment is essential. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the variables that contribute to its improvement in a stage characterised by its decrease. The aim of the present study is to analyse and compare two theoretical models to determine the prediction of teacher and peer support, resilience and positive affect to school adjustment, measured through emotional engagement, school integration problems and perceived academic performance. The design was cross-sectional and participants were 1397 adolescents in high school (M = 13.88, SD = 1.27). The results reveal that teacher and peer support, resilience and positive affect indirectly predict perceived academic performance through school integration problems and emotional engagement. The negative effect of emotional engagement and support from peers on school integration problems is particularly worth highlighting, along with the prediction of resilience on positive affect and that of support from teachers on emotional engagement. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.
