 Clergy often experience a call to help others; however, this passion is hard to sustain because of the chronic and traumatic stress that are components of the job. Because of the unique stressors that are part of professional ministry, clergy need targeted support that is systemic as well as individual to practice resilience. This review of the research provides insight into what factors most impact clergy well-being; as congregations, supervisors, and denominations learn more about these factors, they can more effectively create environments in which clergy can be resilient. This review of the literature also illuminates what clergy might do for themselves to create a sustainable work life that supports their growth and thriving in the midst of adversity in ministry. In addition to articulating the specific stressors clergy face, this review resources congregations, clergy, and supervisors with practical applications of resilience research.
