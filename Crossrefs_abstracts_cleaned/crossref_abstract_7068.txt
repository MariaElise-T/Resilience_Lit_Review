Abstract
Two pairs of herding communities with and without formal communitybased rangeland management experience were studied to understand how the resilience of pastoral communities is influenced by their ability to combine different knowledge types for learning. The two types o f communities differed in number, use and integration of existing knowledge types. Challenges in knowledge integration for learning occur when outside knowledge carriers present their information to herders without relating it to prior knowledge systems. When they establish trusted relationships and meaningful communication with herders, oneway knowledge exchanges are avoided, stimulating equitable, inclusive and durable integration of various knowledge systems essential for social-ecological resilience building.
