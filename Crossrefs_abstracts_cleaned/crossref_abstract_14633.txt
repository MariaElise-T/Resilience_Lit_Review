Abstract
Climate change is inevitable and adaptation is a must. Surabaya as an urban area that contributes to the phenomenon of global warming. The challenges of the City of Surabaya in managing the impacts of climate change need to be further considered. On 21-22 February 2018, the City Government of Surabaya joined the Climate Change Adaptation Workshop. In managing the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to synchronize national, regional and local government policies and create SOPs for climate change adaptation actions. In addition, another priority is spatial planning that takes into account climate change in the context of development. Responding to the suggestions expected from the workshop, this research focuses on assessing risks due to climate change involving institutional aspects. This institutional aspect was taken with the intention of providing recommendations to managers and decision makers in making processes and designing policy analyzes to reduce and adapt to climate change. The results showed that there were six Surabaya City Organizations that were considered to have significant influence and interest in the field of climate change. In addition, historical disaster data on climate change has been derived, which states that disasters in Surabaya include floods, whirlwinds (extreme weather), drought, and forest and land fires. Based on the Likert scale scoring calculation results, it is known that the Surabaya City Organizations resilience a with the CDRI concept is 4.47. This figure indicates that the resilience level of the City of Surabaya is seen from the institutional aspect is relatively high and needs to be maintained.
