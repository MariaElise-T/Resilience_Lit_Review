Spiritual well-being is the affirmation of one’s life in a relation to external world, one’s ownself and a transcendental power like God. It reflects positive feelings, attitudes, and perceptions leading to a sense of identity, wholeness, peace, harmony, and purpose in life. In this study, it is predicted that individuals with high spiritual well-being will be more spiritually resistant during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is one of the most noteworthy periods when people need to be psychologically strong and resilient. In this study, resilience has been defined as the individual endurance against difficulties and the ability to bounce back and even get better. Hence we hypothesized that spiritual well-being of individuals will be effective on their resilience. We conducted our study in Turkey among adults older than 20 years old. We obtained 384 usable data and we analysed our date by using SPSS 20.0 program. Results confirmed the assumption of this study, regarding spiritual well-being/ resilience relationship.
