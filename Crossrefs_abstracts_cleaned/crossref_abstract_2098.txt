 Isolation, quarantine, and fear of the Coronavirus have led to increases in mental health concerns in adults and teens. While research has begun documenting the increased rates of mental illness resulting from the pandemic, there has been little in-depth exploration of how teens from diverse backgrounds are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study was a focus group conducted with 5 TRIO Upward Bound high school students in a midwestern US state to explore how COVID-19 has impacted them and their communities. Results showed that while these teens reported feeling developmentally impeded and unable to follow social distancing guidelines, they also reported finding ways to cope. These results are important in understanding how teens from diverse backgrounds build resiliency, and how they face challenges during social isolation. Future research should involve longitudinal designs that follow teens into their adult lives to determine how development and resilience continue to change over time.
