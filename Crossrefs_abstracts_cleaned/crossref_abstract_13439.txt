The National Association of Indonesian Consultants (INKINDO) stated that almost 25% of engineering consulting companies went bankrupt due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while the rest struggled to survive. This study aims to identify the organizational resilience factors and develop the organizational resilience preliminary framework for engineering consulting companies from a leadership and organizational culture perspective. The qualitative method is chosen by interviews with key persons from engineering consulting companies established for more than 25 years. Then, a recent literature review is conducted to explore the indicators used to assess organizational resilience from a leadership and organizational culture perspective. From the interview, new indicators are found: resource orchestration, risk-taking, and egalitarianism as new indicators from the leadership and reward system and organizational formality level as new indicators from an organizational culture perspective.
