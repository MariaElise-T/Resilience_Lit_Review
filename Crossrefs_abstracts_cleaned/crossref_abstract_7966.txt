Abstract
The paper is devoted to obtaining information on the resilience of kindergarten and primary school teachers. In the research, special attention was paid to beginning teachers, who we thought were more likely to be less resilient than teachers with longer experience. The research sample consisted of teachers of selected kindergartens and primary schools throughout the Czech Republic. The aim of the research was to find out whether there are differences in resilience between selected groups of teachers due to the current pandemic situation that each teacher had to deal with. Analysis of the data in the research revealed that beginning teachers have different rates of resilience compared to advanced teachers. No statistically significant differences were found in resilience between kindergarten and primary school teachers.
