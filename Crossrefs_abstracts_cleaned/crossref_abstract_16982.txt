Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. The UK Biobank does not have measurements of the same cognitive phenotype at distal time points. Therefore, we used education years (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance and current cognitive performance was based on processing speed. This represented an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confounding factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the genetics of resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS)-by-subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience, to generate a GWAS of Resilience. Using independent discovery and replication samples, we found 13 independent genetic loci for Resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and specific cell types. Gene-set analyses implicated the biological process “neuron differentiation”, the cellular component “synaptic part” and the “WNT signalosome”. Mendelian randomisation analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience. These results may contribute to the neurobiological understanding of resilience.
