Since it was recognized as a UNDRR international safety city in 2020, Incheon Metropolitan City has been promoting policies aiming to strengthen resilience strategies for the next 10 years. For the resilience assessment, a Quick Risk Estimation (QRE), which is a risk assessment tool for various disasters, can also be used to support the decision-making of experts on strengthening resilience strategies. However, QRE is unable to provide a detailed risk assessment of a specific disaster such as flood. Therefore, in this study, a flood risk assessment was performed from 2016 to 2019 using the Indicator Based Approach for the 10 cities and counties in Incheon city. The aforementioned method can also support the decision-making of experts for disaster management alongside QRE results. The flood risk assessment in this study consists of four items (hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity) and 11 detailed indicators. The details for each index, item, and flood risk indices were calculated for each evaluation stage. As of 2019, the flood risk index had been calculated for Ganghwa-gun (county), Michuhol-gu (district), Jung-gu, Seo-gu, and Ongjin-gun, among others. The flood risk assessment conducted in this study is believed to be beneficial for a rational decision-making that can support the strengthening of resilience strategies by identifying changes in city- and county-specific situations and risk-exposed indicators in response to flood risks.
