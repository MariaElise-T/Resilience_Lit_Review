The purpose of this study was to investigate the trajectories of multicultural adolescents’ ego-resilience, to compare the effects of neglectful parenting and bilingual competency on the trajectories, and to analyze the longitudinal mediation effect of ego-resilience on these variables’ influence to acculturative stress. In order to accomplish these aims, analysis was conducted using the data of 1,392 adolescents from the Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study. For statistical analysis, AMOS 20.0 was utilized for latent growth modeling and structural equation modeling. Results indicated: (1) a quadratic increase in ego-resilience of multicultural adolescents; (2) a difference in the trajectory of ego-resilience according to gender, with males displaying lower initial values and more rapid growth; (3) significant effects of neglectful parenting and bilingual competency on the trajectories of ego-resilience; and (4) mediating effects of ego-resilience between (a) neglectful parenting and acculturative stress, and (b) bilingual competence and acculturative stress. In accordance with the view of adolescents as prospective leaders in promoting a sustainable future, this study offers insight on the positive psychosocial development and well-being of multicultural adolescents.
