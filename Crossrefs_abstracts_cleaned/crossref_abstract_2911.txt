Several natural hazards have caused unexpected problems to power systems due to climate change, emphasising the position that power systems are not prepared for extremely large-scale events. As a result, the need to study resilience in the context of power systems has been increased. A comprehensive review of the literature on power system resilience (PSR) from various perspectives is presented herein. In this work, the first ever comprehensive definition for PSR is proposed, accounting for both social and technical aspects of resilience. The properties to be included in the construction of a standard definition are also suggested. Well-developed PSR concepts based on resilience trapezoids are discussed. Then, the PSR metrics (PSRMs) are defined, classified, and their selection criteria presented. Subsequently, several evaluation and enhancement frameworks proposed in recent years for PSR are investigated, and a novel comprehensive multidisciplinary PSR evaluation framework is proposed that provides for the application of the proposed comprehensive definition. In addition, classifications of threats to PSR and their respective adaptation measures are also proposed. Finally, this study highlights gaps and proposes future works to achieve a resilient PS. Procedures were followed to (i) identify articles; (ii) review, compare, and analyse articles; and (iii) identify the current literature and research gaps.
