The resilience deformation rules laboratory test research of the soft soil in the Wuhan region in the unloading condition is done through modified triaxial compression apparatus .And the result shows:(1)the critical unloading ratios of the soft soil in Wuhan region is 0.28 and 0.91.No matter the unloading amount is, no resilience deformation is produced when the unloading ratio is smaller than 0.28 or larger than 0.91,and the resilience deformation is produced when the unloading ration is between 0.28 and 0.91.(2)The void ratio is related to the initial preloading ,the bigger the preloading, the smaller the void ratio, and the bigger the increasing of the void ratio after unloading; the smaller the initial preloading ,the bigger the void ratio, and the smaller the increasing of the void ratio after unloading.(3)The peak resilience rate is linear to the initial preloading.
