Introduction: Considering the high mental pressures on nurses at work, identifying the effective resilience factors is deemed necessary. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the mediating role of occupational engagement in the relationship between occupational stress and resilience among the nurses of Al-zahra Hospital of Isfahan.
Methods: The present study was a descriptive survey-correlational study. The population of this study included 1700 nurses from Al-zahra hospital in Isfahan city. Based on Cochran’s formula and by convenience sampling method, 200 people (60 men and 140 women) were chosen. Occupational stress questionnaires of HSE, resilience, and occupational engagement were performed on the sample. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS software using structural equation modeling.
Results: The results showed that occupational stress had a negative and significant effect (P <0.001) on the vibration with the mediating role of occupational engagement. Also, occupational stress had a negative and significant (P <0.001) negative effect on occupation and there was a significant and positive effect (P <0.001) on resilience.
Conclusion:  The results indicate that occupational stress affects the resilience, but if the nurses are engaged in their jobs, this effect will reduce and the construct of engagement will act as a mediating variable.
