The article presents the results of the free associative experiment conducted with the help of STIMULUS based on the reactions to stimuli with the semantics of resilience given by Englishmen and Poles and their psycholinguistic interpretation. Firstly, the authors describe the methodology used in the free associative experiment. In particular, they provide general characteristics of the questionnaire define stimuli (English crisis, crash, stress, pandemic, trauma / Polish kryzys, upadek, stres, pandemia, uraz), characterize the main participants of the free associative experiment (200 respondents, among which there are 75 Englishmen (representatives of Great Britain) and 125 Poles (representatives of the Republic of Poland)) aged 17-23 and 31-39), outline the stages of working out the reactions of Englishmen and Poles to stimuli with the semantics of resilience. Secondly, it is proven that the free associative experiment is aimed at studying the psycholinguistic meaning of a word, its categorical and objective meaning, the specificity of the meaning of some words, the reference words of comparative constructions, the connections between words, the organization of the human lexicon. Thirdly, the preparatory, practical and analytical operational stages of working with STIMULUS are described in detail according to the responses given by the English and Poles. Finally, the psycholinguistic interpretation of the responses to stimuli with the semantics of resilience with an emphasis on the coincidence of semes (from archisemes to differential semes) was carried out to confirm the respondentsâ€™ thinking with the help of synonymous associations.
