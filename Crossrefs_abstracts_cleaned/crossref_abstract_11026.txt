Abstract
Aims
The aim of this literature review is to integrate the results of qualitative research on the resilience experiences of family carers of people with dementia (PWD).

Design
A qualitative meta-synthesis study was conducted.

Methods
The meta-ethnography method of Noblit and Hare (1988) was used. We searched five electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science) using the keywords “caregivers”, “family caregivers”, “spouse caregivers”, “qualitative research”, “resilience, psychological” and “dementia.” The inclusion criteria of the literature search found studies that explored the resilience experience of family carers of PWD, were qualitative, were published in English, and had participants 18 years of age or older.

Results
Eleven studies, 1 from Australia, 4 from USA and 6 from UK, were included in the analysis. Through the process, three themes emerged: ‘Seeing the life of a carer as one’s duty’, ‘Setting boundaries in life’, ‘Moving forward toward a developing life.’ These themes illustrated how family carers of PWD overcome the adversities they encounter.

Conclusion
This meta-synthesis showed how family carers of PWD adapt to and overcome the difficult situations they are confronted with as carers. This review suggests an important direction for enhancing the resilience of family carers of PWD.
