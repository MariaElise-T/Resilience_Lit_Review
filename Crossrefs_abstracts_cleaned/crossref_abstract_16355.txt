The construction industry (CI) is highly relied upon for the economic development of both developing and developed countries. Despite the numerous positive impacts of the CI arising from the heavy investments made by different countries, the adverse impacts remain on the increase as well. Hence, the global call for the adoption of sustainable and resilient construction processes and practices. To increase the resilience (absorptive, adaptive, and restorative) capabilities of the CI, Emerging Technologies (ETs) in form of smart materials, advanced construction, and sensing technologies are deemed imperative. Therefore, the objective of this research study is to assess the awareness level of ETs for a resilient CI. The required data for this research study was obtained through a questionnaire survey. A quantitative data analysis approach was also adopted. The findings revealed a significantly low level of awareness and familiarity with the forty-one (41) ETs for resilience among construction practitioners and stakeholders. Improved technical knowledge and awareness creation on ETs for resilience among construction professionals and stakeholders are highly recommended to set the CI on a sustainable path.
