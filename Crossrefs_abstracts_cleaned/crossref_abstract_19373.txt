 This paper presents an analysis of a tool designed to evaluate the effectiveness of training for operational resilience. The tool measures eight categories of teamwork and four categories of taskwork. Military subject matter experts (SMEs) used the tool to assess the performance of eight cadet teams at The Royal Norwegian Naval Academy during two separate 4-hour simulator exercises and later during a 48-hour live exercise. Positive Spearman rank correlation coefficients between team performance assessments in the simulator exercises and the live exercise were strongest when the simulator scenario emphasized the uncertainty inherent in a complex military maritime exercise.
