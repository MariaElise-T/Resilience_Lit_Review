As part of a larger investigation of very low income families, this study examined the characteristics that differentiated resilient from nonresilient school-age youths, with a focus on self-regulation (e.g., executive function, emotion regulation) skills. Resilience was operationally defined in a robust and comprehensive manner using well-established instruments that measured children's emotional well-being and mental health. Controlling for other explanatory variables, including differences in the experience of negative life events and chronic strains, resilient youths were notably different from nonresilient youths in terms of having greater self-regulatory skills and self-esteem, as well as in receiving more active parental monitoring. Study findings are discussed with regard to the theoretical framework of self-regulation and their implications for preventive intervention.
