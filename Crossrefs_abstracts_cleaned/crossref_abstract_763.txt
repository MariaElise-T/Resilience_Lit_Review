The current pandemic of COVID-19 emphasizes the significance of organizational resilience. Companies that are resilient may be able to face and capitalize on crises to avoid bad consequences, survive, and progress. To truly weather the crisis, organizations, on the other hand, require resilient leaders. This research provides a conceptual framework that will be empirically examined to assess the degree of influence of the variables specified, namely leadership and organizational culture as independent variables and organizational resilience as a dependent variable. This paper poses the groundwork for future empirical research by proposing a conceptual framework, presenting hypotheses, and exploring implications for future research. It also provides important information on how to manage organizational resilience effectively. The empirical results will significantly benefit school administrators, human resource practitioners, academicians, researchers, and policy makers.
