Purpose: The aim of this research is to determine the relationship between organizational change fatigue levels of teachers working in secondary education institutions and organizational resilience levels of these institutions.
Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was organized in relational screening model. The population of the research consisted of teachers working in high schools located within the borders of Kastamonu province. Proportional stratified sampling method was used in the study. The sampling included 313 teachers. In the study, the "Organizational Change Fatigue Scale”, which was developed by Bernerth et. al. 2011 and adapted to Turkish in 2020 and whose validity and reliability study was conducted by Limon, was used to measure the organizational change fatigue level of teachers. In order to measure the organizational resilience level of secondary education institutions, the “Organizational Resilience Scale” developed by Kantur and Say in 2015 was used. Pearson Product Moments Correlation Coefficient, Independent Sample t-test, One-Way Anova and Regression Analysis techniques were used in the analysis of the data.
Findings: In the analyzes made, it was concluded that teachers working in high schools experienced change fatigue at the level of "agree", that high schools were resilient at the level of "agree", that there was no significant relationship between teachers' organizational change fatigue levels and organizational resilience, and that the level of change fatigue was not a significant predictor of organizational resilience.
