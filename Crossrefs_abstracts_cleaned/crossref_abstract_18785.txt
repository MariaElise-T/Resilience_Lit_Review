AbstractProblemAdolescents with beta thalassemia major face various physical and psychosocial challenges. Resilience plays a protective role in coping with the stress resulting from this disease.MethodsThis descriptive correlational study was carried out on 134 adolescents (age: 11–21 years old) with beta‐thalassemia major who were referred at the Thalassemia Centre in southern Iran from October to December 2018 via convenience sampling method. The Jalowiec Coping scale and Connor‐Davidson resilience scale were the instruments used in this study. Data analysis was done using Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression.FindingsResilience was shown to be correlated with the subscales of confrontive, optimistic, supportant, and evasive coping significantly and positively (p < .001), while in the subscale of emotive coping with resilience, this was not significant. In addition, 38% of variations in the scale of resilience were explained by the five coping subscales.ConclusionsThe findings of this study, indicated the role of courageous coping in promoting resilience and defensive coping as a factor that leads to less resilience than optimal level. Hence, understanding the importance and the role of protective factors and risk factors can help healthcare providers in planning some effective interventions to increase resilience among adolescents with thalassemia.
