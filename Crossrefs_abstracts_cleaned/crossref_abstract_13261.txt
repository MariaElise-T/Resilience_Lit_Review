Using convenient sampling method, 30 subjects were selected and randomly assigned to either REBT tests or a control group (10 subjects in each). The 26 codes of ethics were observed in the study and the data were analyzed using SPSS17.


Results
Before the intervention, the anxiety score was 26.75 (4.43) and after the intervention it was 18 (4.403) (p < 0.05), but in the control group it was 31.34 (6.04) before the intervention and after the intervention it was 32.35 (5.17) (p > 0.05). Before the intervention, the anxiety score was 52.77 (13.37) and after the intervention it was 60.00 (14.31) (p < 0.05), but in the control group it was 47.00 (8.73) before the intervention and after the intervention it was 49.76 (9.10) (p > 0.05).


Conclusions
REBT was effective in students as it reduced anxiety and increased resilience. Thus, it is suggested for use in studentsâ€™ care.
