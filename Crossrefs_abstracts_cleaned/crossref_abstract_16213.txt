 Background COVID-19-related travel restrictions profoundly impacted short-term medical missions (STMMs) abroad. This study describes the effect of the pandemic as perceived by STMM organisations serving Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).   Methods Information was updated for 359 primary care STMM organisations previously active in 2015, which were contained within an existing online database. Organisations were contacted to complete an online survey that gathered quantitative and qualitative descriptions of pandemic-related adaptations and program changes.   Results 22.5% (73/324) of previously active organisations had no website activity since 2020 or earlier, no longer existed, or had unclear website activity. Eighty-seven organisations responded to the survey. Ninety-six percent indicated that they would definitely (72/86, 84%) or probably (10/86, 12%) return to sending STMMs in the next five years, and most (46/83, 55%) of these intended to send an STMM within the next six months. Seventy-two respondents (93%) reported new adaptations, including direct funding for local healthcare professionals, sending equipment to host communities, focusing on training and teaching, and incorporating virtual care and electronic medical records.   Conclusions The results demonstrate resilience, flexibility and optimism among STMM organisations and an intent to return to pre-pandemic programming rapidly.
