AbstractAimsThe present study aimed to explore the effects of a guided self‐help mindfulness intervention on psychological resilience and job burnout among psychiatric nurses.BackgroundPsychiatric nurses work in challenging and potentially high stress settings. Mindfulness interventions can improve psychological resilience and reduce job burnout of nurses. However, face‐to‐face delivery of mindfulness interventions may be inconvenient for individuals. Guided self‐help interventions may be more accessible.MethodsThis randomized controlled trial was conducted from January to August 2022. One hundred and eighteen psychiatric nurses were randomized into the intervention and control groups. The individuals in the intervention group received an 8‐week guided self‐help mindfulness intervention, while the individuals in the control group received a psycho‐educational brochure. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory‐Human Services Survey were used to evaluate the levels of mindfulness, psychological resilience and job burnout, respectively.ResultsAfter an 8‐week intervention, compared with the control group, the levels of mindfulness and psychological resilience were higher, while the level of job burnout was lower in the intervention group.ConclusionsThe guided self‐help mindfulness intervention can improve psychological resilience and reduce job burnout among psychiatric nurses.
