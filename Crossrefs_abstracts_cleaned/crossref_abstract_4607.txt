Rapid population growth, changing weather conditions and an increasing number of natural disasters have left human beings more vulnerable and exposed to natureâ€™s onslaught. Disaster Management Organizations (DMOs) need to be more resilient, responsive and effective to counter these natural hazards and should not leave any stone unturned in order to play their pivotal role in rescue, relief and rehabilitation. Organizational knowledge and logistics are two core factors considered most significant in transforming a DMO into a resilient organization that can shoulder its due responsibility in a plausible and desired manner. This paper is an initial attempt that discusses the integration of knowledge resources and logistics to accelerate the process of the said transformation.
