This study aimed to investigate the relationship between academic passion (AP) and subjective well-being (SWB), along with the mediating role of psychological resilience (PR) and the moderating role of academic climate (AC), among Chinese female research talent in reserve. A convenience sampling method was used to select 304 female masterâ€™s degree students from several universities in the central region of China a questionnaire survey. The results show that: (1) AP has a positive predictive effect on the SWB of female reserve research talents; (2) PR partially mediated the relationship between the AP and SWB of female reserve research talents; (3) AC moderated the relationship between the AP and SWB of female reserve research talents. Thus, the findings of this study support a moderated mediation model that explores the relationship between AP and SWB for female research backups, with PR as the mediating variable and AC as the moderating variable. These findings provide a new perspective with which to explore the mechanisms influencing the subjective well-being of female research reserves.
