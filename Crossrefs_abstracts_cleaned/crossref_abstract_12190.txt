 This study sought to provide the initial psychometric evidence supporting a new measure of resiliency. In consideration of the shortcomings of previous measures, a more comprehensive measure was developed based on the theoretical model of King and Rothstein (2010) . The resulting measure, the Workplace Resilience Inventory (WRI), encompasses an individualâ€™s personal characteristics, social support network, initial responses to a significant and life changing event, and self-regulatory processes. Following a rigorous, theoretically-based, and empirically-supported procedure for selecting items, the facets of the WRI demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, as well as adequate independence. The WRI demonstrates significant relations with important well-being criteria, such as satisfaction with life, depression, and perceived stress, and demonstrates incremental validity above and beyond a previously validated measure of resiliency, the Psychological Capital (PsyCap) questionnaire.
