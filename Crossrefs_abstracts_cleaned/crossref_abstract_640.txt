Abstract
1. The tensile strength of vulcanized rubber may be expressed in terms of its elongation by means of the calculus of finite differences. 2. This expression for tensile strength, based on the theoretical cross-sectional area, gives an expression for the tensile strength based on the original cross-sectional area when the former quantity is divided by the factor (E + 1), E being the elongation. 3. The expression for tensile strength based on the original cross-sectional area is integrated with respect to the elongation to give the resilient energy. 4. The trapezoidal rule has proved itself to be superior to the calculus of finite differences as a practical method of obtaining the resilient energy. 5. The total resilient energies are plotted on graphs against the percentage by volume of reinforcing agent or filler. Tangents drawn at any desired point corresponding to a certain percentage of filler give values for the partial resilient energies of base mix and of filler by the method of tangent intercepts. 6. The expressions for tensile strength are composed of one, two or three functions ; the number of functions is, in general, inversely proportional to the percentage of the filler in the vulcanizate. 7. The expressions for tensile strength and for resilient energies have no significance regarding the structure of vulcanized rubber; they have been evolved from the point of view of usefulness for evaluating compounds. 8. The values of the partial resilient energies of base mix and of filler obtained by the method of tangent intercepts have no physical meaning; they are a means of calculating the total resilient energy of a sample of vulcanized rubber.
