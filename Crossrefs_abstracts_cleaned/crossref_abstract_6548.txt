Using the derivative of the Boolean function and the e-derivative defined by ourselves as main research tools, we study the relationship among e-derivative, algebraic immunity and resilience of balanced H Boolean functions.We get some theorems which connect algebraic immunity, annihilators, resilience, derivative and e-derivative of balanced H Boolean functions together. Besides, we also get the judgment of algebraic immunity and resilience for three classes of balanced Boolean functions by the e-derivative.
