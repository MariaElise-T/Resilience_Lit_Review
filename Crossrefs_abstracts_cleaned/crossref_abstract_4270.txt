The deep modifications to climate are currently provoking risks of increasing impact, that can cause unexpected consequences, interacting with other risks. However, the available planning regulations and instruments appear inadequate to face this challenge, most of all at a local scale. This paper presents a semi-quantitative methodology for the assessment of multiple risks, developed for the direct use of the municipality technicians, in order to increase their awareness towards multiple risks and unexpected events that could hit their territory. The methodology is based on the assignation of rates to the risks, and on a simple calculation of the binary interactions. It was tested on two Italian case studies, revealing a good feasibility in the results obtained for the interactions, and highlighting some problems neglected in the sectorial risk plans. The methodology is a background knowledge of the ‘Responsible Risk Resilience Center’ (R3C) of Politecnico di Torino, and it was furtherly developed through an in-depth analysis of the territorial vulnerabilities. This paper introduces two new indicators of sensitivity towards external risks, related to fire and flood risks, proposed for the application at a local scale. The indicators belong to a wider R3C framework in the phase of development to operationalize resilience.
