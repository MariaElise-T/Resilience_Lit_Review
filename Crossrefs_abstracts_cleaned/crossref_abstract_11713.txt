As everything around us will be linked to the net in many ways via the Internet of Things (IoTs) and compared to the standard Internet, new forms of problems and complications can arise. Huge IoTs experiments are currently under way, most of which concern its sight, supporting technology, software, or facilities. Recently, a limited studies have comprehensively defined the security requirements such as privacy concerns, security, and trusting in the IoTs that are deemed special to the future net, these terms need to be discussed and addressed via numerous scholars and research groups as well. This article surveyed through 102 references from popular literature databases to explore the features\ properties that define the distinctive IoT relating to forthcoming privacy, security and trust issues. Then created security requirements that were triggered by the mentioned properties. This article examined the privacy, security, trust and resilience components of the three most popular IoT architectures in consideration of the requirements as well. Also, this survey contributed to the state-of-the-art security issues for embedded devices in Internet of Things world including provide a comparative table of well-known secure routing protocols and their countermeasures to well-known attacks on Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) structure of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) within Internet of Things world. Finally, this survey identifies a number of study gaps that will serve as the foundation for future research.
