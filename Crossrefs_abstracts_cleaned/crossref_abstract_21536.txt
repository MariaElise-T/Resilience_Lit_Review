Objectives. To investigate resilience strategies used by Black gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) to navigate racism and heterosexism.Methods. In 2019, we conducted in-depth interviews with 46 Black MSM in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Ohio. Thematic analysis, informed by intersectionality, was used to identify intersectional resilience within the context of participants’ lives.Results. Our analyses revealed ways in which Black MSM respond to stigma and oppression. We identified the following themes that capture these experiences: pride in intersectional identities, perseverance, community advocacy, and social support. Our analyses reveal how men draw on these assets and resources to positively adapt despite experiences of racism and heterosexism.Conclusions. Intersectional resilience can support Black MSM in navigating racism and heterosexism. However, public health interventions at the institutional and system levels are needed to directly target the root causes of oppression and support resources that facilitate intersectional resilience.
