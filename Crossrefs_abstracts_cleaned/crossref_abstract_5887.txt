This paper sought to examine the perception of survivors of tragedy in Kenya on Psychological Resilience. The study adopted a mixed design approach. The target population for this study was 50. It comprised all individuals who were victims of the fire tragedy at Kiambaa village. Questionnaires and unstructured interview schedule were the main tools of data collection. The 25 item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25 (CD-RISC-25) (used with permission) Connor and Davidson (2003) was used to measure the resilience levels of the respondents. Means and Standard deviations were computed to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of resilience among the respondents. Responses from research tools were cleaned, coded and entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. Pearson product moment correlation analysis, Chi square correlation analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis were computed to establish the relationships between study variables. Findings were presented in form of tables, cumulative frequency counts, graphs and charts.
