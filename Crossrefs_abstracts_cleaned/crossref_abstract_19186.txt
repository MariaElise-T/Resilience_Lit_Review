AbstractThe objectives of this article are to introduce a conceptual framework for physical resilience in the context of ageing and to discuss key elements and challenges in the design of studies of physical resilience after health stressors. Advancing age is associated with increasing exposure to multiple stressors and declining capacity to respond to health stressors. Resilience is defined broadly as the ability to resist or recover well from the adverse effects of a health stressor. In ageing‚Äêrelated study designs of physical resilience after a health stressor, this dynamic resilience response can be observed as changes in repeated measures of function or health status in various domains important to older adults. Methodologic issues in selecting the study population, defining the stressor, covariates, outcomes, and analytic strategies are highlighted in the context of an ongoing prospective cohort study of physical resilience after total knee replacement surgery. The article concludes with approaches to intervention development to optimize resilience.
