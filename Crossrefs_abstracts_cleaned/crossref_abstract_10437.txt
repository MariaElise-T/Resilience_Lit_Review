Abstract

Aim
Core Surgical Training (CST) programs are associated with a 60% risk of burnout and failure to progress. This study aimed to assess the influence of a novel Enhanced Stress and Resilience Training (ESRT) course delivered alongside a focused induction at the start of CST in a single UK Statutory Education Body.


Method
All CST1s were invited to participate in a six-week ESRT course teaching mindfulness-based exercises to develop tools to deal with stress at work and burnout. Primary outcome measures were compliance with ESRT programme and degree of burnout measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) scoring.


Results
Of 43 boot camp attendees, 38 trainees completed questionnaires, with 24 choosing to participate (63.2%; male 13, female 11, median age 28 yr.) Burnout was identified in 23 trainees (60.5%) with no evident difference in baseline MBI scores between participants or not (p = 0.77, median 4 [0-11] vs. 4 [1-11]). MBI scores were comparable before and after ESRT in the intervention cohort (p = 0.63, median 4 [0-11] vs. 4 [1-10]). Qualitative data reflected challenges delivering ESRT because of arduous and inflexible clinical on-call rotas and time pressures related to academic curriculum demands. Despite these challenges, 22 (91.6%) considered the course valuable, 14 (58.3%) continued to use the techniques in daily clinical work there was and unanimous support to continue the program in future.


Conclusion
ESRT was feasible and further research is warranted to determine its medium-term efficacy.
