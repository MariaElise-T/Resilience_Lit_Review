Suicidal behaviors and academic difficulties are characteristics that stigmatize youth as “bad” or “troubled” students. Alternative school programs aim to help students struggling with mental health and academic issues. This study explores how high school students make meaning of experiences of suicidality and resilience with respect to mainstream constructs of mental health, education, and identity. Three cases were selected from a sample of 44 interviews with alternative high school students: an 18-year-old White cisgender heterosexual male, a 17-year-old White transgender male (sexuality unspecified), and an 18-year-old Latina cisgender bisexual woman. A preliminary analysis of participant interviews with histories of severe suicidality informed this case selection. Using narrative analysis, common themes emerged: contamination versus redemption, the importance of having space, the physical experience of suicidality, and critical turning points in rejecting stigmatized identities. The findings have implications for practice and research focused on building student resiliency against suicidality.
