Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship of job stress, burnout, and resilience of 271 nurses who worked alternately at a university hospital in South Korea Province and a state-designated inpatient ward for COVID-19 in Korea. Methods: The study sample included nurses who worked at a university hospital in South Korea, during the period between February 2020 and May 2021. The participants (n = 271) responded to an online survey between April 2021 and 12 May 2021. The questionnaire included information related to job stress, burn out, and resilience. Results: In phase 1 of regression, job stress had a significant negative effect on resilience of recovery (β = −0.397, p < 0.001). In phase 2, job stress had a significant positive effect on burnout (β = 0.513, p < 0.001). In phase 3, resilience had a significant negative effect on burnout (β = −0.459, p < 0.001). Seventy-five percent of burnout was directly associated with job stress, while 25% of burnout was indirectly associated through mediated effects, through resilience. Conclusions: The promotion of resilience would not only serve as the basis for active coping in situations where burnout and stress are severe, but also serve as a basic driving force for actively overcoming them. Further study to cope with stress and reduce burnout at the organizational level should be conducted.
