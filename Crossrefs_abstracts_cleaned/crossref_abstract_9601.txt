The aim of this study was to identify and compare resilience factors in Belgian and South African remarried families. A parent and a child from 38 South African and 36 Belgian remarried families participated in the study, which was conducted within relatively the same time frame in the two countries. Participants completed a biographical questionnaire and six selfreport questionnaires. The results show differences and similarities in terms of the identified resilience factors between the two populations. The present study contributes to the growing body of literature related to family resilience, specifically within the context of remarriage â€“ a relatively new terrain within the field of family resilience research. Suggestions are made for the strengthening of these families.
