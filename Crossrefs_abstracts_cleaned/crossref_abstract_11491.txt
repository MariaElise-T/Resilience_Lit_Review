AbstractPurpose:  The aim of this study was to compare between the effects of resilient liner and clip attachments of bar‐implant‐retained mandibular overdenture on peri‐implant tissues.Materials and methods:  In a randomized‐controlled clinical trial, 30 edentulous male patients (mean age 62.5 years) were equally assigned to two groups. In each patient, two implants were inserted in the canine area of the mandible using a two‐stage surgical protocol. After 3 months, the implants were connected with resilient bars. Mandibular overdentures were retained to the bars with either clips (group I) or silicone‐resilient liners (group II). Peri‐implant tissues were evaluated clinically (with regard to plaque scores, gingival scores and probing depths) and radiographically (with regard to peri‐implant vertical and horizontal alveolar bone changes). Evaluations were performed at the time of overdenture insertion (T0), 6 months (T6) and 12 months (T12) after overdenture insertion.Results:  After 12 months of using bar‐implant‐retained mandibular overdenture, the resilient liner attachment had significantly decreased peri‐implant plaque score, gingival score, probing depth, vertical and horizontal bone loss when compared with the clip attachment.Conclusion:  Within the limitations of this study, and in terms of peri‐implant tissue health of bar‐implant‐retained mandibular overdenture, we recommend resilient liner rather than clip attachment.
