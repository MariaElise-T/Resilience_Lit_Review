This phenomenological inquiry explored the lived experiences of resilience of 21 transgender individuals. Through individual semistructured interviews (3 interviews each with 5 participants) and 1 focus group interview (16 participants), the authors identified 5 common resiliency themes (evolving a self‐generated definition of self, embracing self‐worth, awareness of oppression, connection with a supportive community, and cultivating hope for the future) and 2 variant themes (social activism and being a positive role model for others). Future practice and research directions are discussed.
