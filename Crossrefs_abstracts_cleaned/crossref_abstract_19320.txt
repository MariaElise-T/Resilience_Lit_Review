An individual's sense of self and identity is a developmental cognition informed by the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, proximal others, and systems of belief. Today's identity-seeking adolescent may internalize pressures and expectations from a growing base of social narratives that extends beyond the reach of family and friends. Cultivating daily practices that foster hope and resilience can support positive well-being outcomes for individuals, families, and communities who are faced with distress or traumatic events. Overall well-being within a classroom can be nourished through collaborative growth mindsets, positive coping skills, and cognitive reappraisals. Hope and resilience can be fostered through daily habits of awareness, gratitude, and simple meditation exercises. An off-the-mat approach to the practice of yoga-inspired philosophy can be used in the classroom or at home to support the skills necessary to foster the constructs of hope, develop resilience, and support flexible cognition that builds and sustains positive social, emotional, mental, and physical well-being.
