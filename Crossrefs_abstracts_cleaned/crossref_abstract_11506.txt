The resilient modulus represents the subgrade soil stiffness, and it is considered one of the key material inputs in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The resilient modulus is typically estimated in the laboratory using a repeated load cyclic triaxial test, which is complex and time consuming to perform. Technical ability is also required to prepare the test specimens, particularly for coarse-grained soils. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the resilient modulus of coarse-grained soils from other simpler tests. In this study, correlations of resilient modulus with soil index properties and quick shear (QS) test results (quick shear strength, stress at 1% strain and tangent modulus) were developed for remolded coarse-grained soils, collected from different geographic regions in South Carolina. The developed models showed good correlations of resilient modulus to tangent modulus and soil index properties. The average tangent, modulus obtained from 30% and 50% of maximum stress of the QS tests, moisture content, optimum moisture content, dry unit weight, and maximum dry unit weight showed a statistically significant effect on estimating the resilient modulus for coarse-grained subgrade soils. The validation study confirms that the developed models can be used for predicting the resilient modulus for South Carolina coarse-grained soils.
