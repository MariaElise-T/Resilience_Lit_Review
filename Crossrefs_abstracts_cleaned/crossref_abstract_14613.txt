The aim of this study is to investigate relationships between positive psychology resources – resilience, general self-efficacy and wisdom dimensions – cognitive, reflective and affective in different level business leaders and to investigate differences between two groups of leaders – with higher general self-efficacy and lower general self-efficacy. The study was carried out based on theories of psychological resources. Resources not only buffer against the potentially harmful stress effects of the demands of working life, but may promote development and optimal performance, which is necessary for leaders to be able to meet increasing demands of their role. 83 respondents (57 women, 26 men) different level business leaders participated in the study. 
Results showed that in sample of leaders group there are statistically significant relationships between resilience and self-efficacy, resilience and reflective wisdom dimension, self-efficacy and wisdom reflective and cognitive dimensions. Results of difference analysis showed that there are differences in levels of psychological resources between high general self-efficacy leaders and low general self-efficacy leaders. High general self-efficacy leaders showed higher results in all tested psychological resources and statistically significant differences between two groups were reported in resilience. Results suggest that low self-efficacy leaders would be less able to adapt to uncertainty, and/ or bounce back or recover from stress. Research results suggest that higher level of general self-efficacy is related to higher levels of resources – resilience and wisdom.
Key words: psychological resources, resilience, self-efficacy, wisdom.
