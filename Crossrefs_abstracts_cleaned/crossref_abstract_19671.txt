Currently mobile operators spend more money towards maintaining the mobile network in fsinding faults, which will degrade the cellular services. If any fault occurs in the network it must be healed automatically and made to work. This self-healing network gives solutions for fixing or helps in deciding the problems to be carried out autonomously with no human interference. Also the networks ability to recover after any failure is said to be resilience. This paper discusses the strategy of resilience of complex network, its principles and metrics of resilience. The main aim of self-healing and resilience is to heal the network automatically and the network must recover after any fault.
