This article presents a developed intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM). More precisely, the presented C-O-OFDM is based on the C-transform as a unitary orthogonal transform instead of the state-of-the-art discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Due to the properties of the real C-transform, Hermitian symmetry (HS) is not required to produce real OFDM samples. Therefore, the proposed scheme supports twice the input symbols compared to conventional DFT-based OFDM system. Real data mapping and DC bias technology is considered to evaluate the performance of the presented scheme over optical wireless multipath. The simulation results shows that the proposed C-O-OFDM is more resilience to multipath phenomena than the competitive DFT-O-OFDM and DHT-O-OFDM schemes for similar bit rate. The proposed scheme achieves about 22 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain in comparison with the DFT-O-OFDM and about 2.5 dB SNR gain in comparison with the DHT-O-OFDM scheme.
