They completed questionnaires online. Data were analysed by SPSS software version 22.ResultsFindings showed a strong and inverse correlation between identity crisis with suicide resilience (r = −.92, p < .001) and quality of life (r = −.87, p < .001). Variables of suicide resilience, being a child of a divorced family, cause of burns, extent of burn, financial situation, gender and age can predict 68.74% of the variance in identity crisis in these patients.Patient or Public ContributionAdolescents with burns suffer from an identity crisis, and although they report high resilience to suicide, they have a mediocre quality of life.
