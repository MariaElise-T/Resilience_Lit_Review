AbstractThis study aimed to explore the experience and perceptions of frailty in hospitalized older adults and caregivers caring for older adults, in relation to resilience and self窶親fficacy. A qualitative explorative descriptive study design was utilized. Face to face interviews were conducted from September 2020 to July 2021 with 24 older adults who were 65 years and above and hospitalized in the acute care hospital. Ten informal family caregivers were also recruited. Data were analysed using an inductive content analysis approach. Frailty encompassed physical elements as well as manifestations of psychological traits, fear of the unknown, and being in control. Resilience was determined by individual psychological traits and mindset, and the possession of a coping mechanism. Self窶親fficacy could influence both frailty and resilience through inner motivation and assistance received. Older adults and family caregivers reported that considerable decline in physical health with age and level of perseverance can determine the level of frailty. Resilience and self窶親fficacy play a pivotal role in the context of frailty. Understanding resilience in this context will assist nurses to facilitate the use of individual and sociocultural resources to improve the way resilience is experienced by older adults. Various coping strategies can enhance self窶親fficacy and build greater resilience in older adults, including maintaining their active involvement in health management and social life.
