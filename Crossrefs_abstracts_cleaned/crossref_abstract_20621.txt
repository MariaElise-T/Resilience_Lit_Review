AbstractBackground and aimsResilience and recovery are of increasing importance in the field of alcohol dependence (AD). This paper describes how imaging studies in man can be used to assess the neurobiological correlates of resilience and, if longitudinal, of disease trajectories, progression rates and markers for recovery to inform treatment and prevention options.MethodsOriginal papers on recovery and resilience in alcohol addiction and its neurobiological correlates were identified from PubMed and have been analyzed and condensed within a systematic literature review.ResultsFindings deriving from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have identified links between increased resilience and less task‐elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia, and benefits of heightened neural pre‐frontal cortex (PFC) engagement regarding resilience in a broader sense; namely, resilience against relapse in early abstinence of AD. Furthermore, findings consistently propose at least partial recovery of brain glucose metabolism and executive and general cognitive functioning, as well as structural plasticity effects throughout the brain of alcohol‐dependent patients during the course of short‐, medium‐ and long‐term abstinence, even when patients only lowered their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. Additionally, specific factors were found that appear to influence these observed brain recovery processes in AD, e.g. genotype‐dependent neuronal (re)growth, gender‐specific neural recovery effects, critical interfering effects of psychiatric comorbidities, additional smoking or marijuana influences or adolescent alcohol abuse.ConclusionsNeuroimaging research has uncovered neurobiological markers that appear to be linked to resilience and improved recovery capacities that are furthermore influenced by various factors such as gender or genetics. Consequently, future system‐oriented approaches may help to establish a broad neuroscience‐based research framework for alcohol dependence.
