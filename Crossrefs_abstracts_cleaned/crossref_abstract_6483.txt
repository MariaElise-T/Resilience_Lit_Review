By use of Small Angle X-Ray, Infrared and Rheology methods a wealth of knowledge has been generated in the past about the formation and final morphology of the elastomers which constitute Flexible Polyurethane Foams. The current view is that Slab foam polymers have a three phase structure with polyurea microdomains, macrophase separated polyurea and the soft polyether phase. High Resilient foam polymers do not show the polyurea macrophase and have less of the strongly hydrogen bonded urea visible in IR.The chain length of the polyurea segments is unknown due to experimental difficulties with isolating these structures from a crosslinked polymer. A new method is being described using monols of the same equivalent weight in place of the triols and separating the species containing the hard segments according to their length by solvent extraction. The chemical composition of the urea segment can then be analyzed by13C NMR or IR. It was found that a considerable number of short urea chains are present in both Slab and HR foam polymers.
