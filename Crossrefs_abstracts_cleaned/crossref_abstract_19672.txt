This paper addresses the psychological consequences associated with experiencing traumatic events during warfare. The negative aspect of these experiences is discussed, which should be associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome, but also with the possibility of “moral injury” that may occur as a result of transgression of ethical and cultural norms. The positive aspect of traumatic events is also presented, which is connected with the possibility of increased psychological resilience, as well as experience of “post-traumatic growth” understood as experiencing positive psychological change as a result of coping with very difficult life circumstances.
