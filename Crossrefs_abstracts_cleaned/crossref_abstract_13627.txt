With the rapid increment of power outages related to extreme natural disasters such as wildfires and severe storms, microgrids have the potential to enhance resilience locally. Traditionally, grid-connected microgrids are investigated from an economic perspective only, without focusing on resilience solutions benefits during grid interruptions. Hence, the presented work proposes a technical and economic evaluation of an airport grid-connected microgrid consisting of solar photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system, and diesel generator to enhance airport power resilience under different power interruption scenarios. A modified mixed-integer linear programming scheme was introduced to minimize the total annual operating cost of the proposed resilient system. The optimal resilient microgrid components sizing and dispatching were investigated with and without a monetary assigned value for resilience as a service. Moreover, the microgrid survivability during solar performance change was investigated. The possible load increment from electric ground support equipment deployment was considered. The results show that the proposed microgrid can achieve an annual operational cost reduction while ensuring a continuous power supply for all considered outage scenarios. The operational cost saving varies between 20% and 22%. The duration of the outage and critical load level have a higher impact on microgrid sizing and dispatching.
