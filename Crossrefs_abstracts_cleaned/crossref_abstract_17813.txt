This study aims to discover how artificial intelligence adoption in notion (AI) plays a role in digital innovation using the theoretical foundation of diffusion of innovations and effectuation theories. The current research also investigates the moderating role of other edge Internet of Things (IoT) and the mediating role of adaptive resilience. The data collection is performed using a survey conducted among employees of family-owned SMEs. The findings reveal that AI forecasts digital innovation through adaptive resilience. The results also confirm the moderating role of threat to IoT edge and the mediating role of adaptive resilience, but moderated mediating is not supported. We conclude that family-owned SMEs intend to adopt AI, but SMEs face challenges using IoT edge. This study has implications for family firms specifically and technology adopters in general.
