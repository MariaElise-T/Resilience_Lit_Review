AbstractMoral distress results from the threat to professional moral integrity and identity. This phenomenon is well documented in nursing literature. Persistent and unresolved moral distress is frequently linked to high nursing staff turnover and shortages. Engagement in a structured hermeneutic critical reflective process facilitated identification of micro, meso, and macro factors influencing the experience of moral distress. Following this process, a theorized model was developed to illustrate interactions between influences contributing to the experience of moral distress in nurses. The model highlights where opportunities lay to take action to avoid or minimize the negative consequences of this phenomenon. Professional resilience is achieved via the conscientious development of professional identity and practice of critical reflection, as components of enculturation of nurses into the profession. Undergraduate and further nurse education activities must focus on developing the necessary attitude, confidence, and skills to address issues in practice which contribute to the experience moral distress to build resilience.
