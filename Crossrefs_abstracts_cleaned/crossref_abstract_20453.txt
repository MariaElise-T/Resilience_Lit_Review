After the fragility curve is established, the probability of structural damage reaching each level of damage under the action of the ground motion can be determined according to the ground motion parameters, so as to calculate the direct and indirect loss caused by the structural damage and complete the earthquake damage prediction. This paper combines the improved IMK resilience model to study the seismic vulnerability of high-pier and long-span bridges. Moreover, this paper obtains the parameter calculation model based on the regression analysis of PEERâ€™s 255 column specimen data. The improved IMK model needs to modify the elastic stiffness and strain hardening rate of the rotating spring to ensure the accuracy of the lateral stiffness of the component. The experimental research shows that the seismic vulnerability research model of high-pier and long-span bridges based on the improved IMK restoring force model has a certain analytical effect.
