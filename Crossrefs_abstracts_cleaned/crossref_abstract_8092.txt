This paper shows the research developed in order to evaluate two resilience indicators, PHRI and Rsys, in the San Francisco de Cunuguachay pressurized irrigation network, specifically in the Yulchir√≥n 2 branch. In this context, the irrigation branch was designed to operate on an on-demand basis and in shifts in order to evaluate the indicators in both operation modes, subjecting the network to unfavourable events. The resilience at the level of pressures and demands of the branch is estimated to remain operational in the different disruptive events, meeting the minimum conditions of the initial design. In this regard, with the implementation of resilience indicators in irrigation networks, it is possible to diagnose the response of the network to changes in its operation. Therefore, the use of indicators allows for obtaining a more reliable and adaptable network to changes in its operation. Consequently, the use of indicators allows for obtaining more reliable and adaptable networks to changes, since the engineer can make the right decisions in the project, improving the planning and management of irrigation networks.
