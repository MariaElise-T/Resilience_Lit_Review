 Dietary fat overload (DFO) is widely used to model diabetic cardiomyopathy but the utility of this model is controversial. We comprehensively characterized cardiac contractile and mitochondrial function in C57BL6/J mice fed with lard-based or saturated fat-enriched diets initiated at two ages. Despite cardiac hypertrophy, contractile and mitochondrial function is preserved, and molecular adaptations likely limit lipotoxicity. The resilience of these hearts to DFO underscores the need to develop robust alternative models of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
