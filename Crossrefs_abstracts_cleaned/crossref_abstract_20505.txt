Enhancing organizational resilience is an important way for enterprises to achieve sustained competitive advantage. Based on dynamic capability theory, organizational learning theory, and resource-based theory, this study constructs a theoretical model of organizational resilience and sustained competitive advantage with organizational learning as the mediating variable and environmental dynamism as the moderating variable. This study is based on questionnaire research data from 462 Chinese companies in selected regions as the research sample for empirical testing, and the results show that organizational resilience helps Chinese companies to gain sustainable competitive advantage; organizational learning plays a mediating role between organizational resilience and sustainable competitive advantage; and environmental dynamics has a positive moderating role between organizational resilience and organizational learning, and can positively regulate the path of organizational resilience affecting sustainable competitive advantage through organizational learning. In view of this, we propose practical insights for Chinese companies on three levels: motivating mechanisms for organizational resilience, shaping a good learning environment, and paying attention to the dynamics of the environment.
