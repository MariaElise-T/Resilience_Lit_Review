 Objective: We report the effect of COVID-19 confinement on some psychological variables associated with mental health: Stress perception, types of coping strategies during crises, and some components related to resilience. Method: A national sample of the Mexican population was considered in a total of 2775 people whose ages ranged from 15Â years and older. Questionnaires that met the psychometric criteria (reliability and validity) to be used in Latino samples were used. Results: The results showed that older people experienced less stress and displayed more efficient coping behaviors. Discussion: Regarding the exploration of some components associated with resilience, it was found that family constitutes an important interpersonal resource for coping with the crisis related to confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, it is proposed to make comparisons of the psychological factors evaluated to detect and analyze possible fluctuations due to the prevalence of epidemic conditions.
