Abstract

Paracoccus marginatus is one of the important pestson papaya. This study was conducted to evaluate the presence of one of the Chrysopa predators, Plesiochrysa ramburi to papaya invested by P. marginatus. The study used the non-factorial design with the factor of the number of predators (1, 3, 5, 7), which was released to oneovisac of P. marginatus. All treatments in the experiment had five replications. Descriptively, this study showed that the presence of Pl. ramburi, positively, affected the resilience of the plant, in this case through the mechanism of population control of P. marginatus. The presence of predators, negatively, affected P. marginatus eating behavior, which was reduced food intake behavior, which was influenced by feeding behavior. Thus it could increase plant resilience. If the presence of predators negatively affected pest eating behavior, the presence of predators could positively influence plant resilience.
