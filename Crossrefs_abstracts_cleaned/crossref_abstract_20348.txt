Resilience to failures and deliberate attacks is becoming an essential requirement in most point-to-point communication networks today. The present paper presents a survey of strategies to ensure resilience in peer-to-peer communication networks by means of operating systems virtualization. Virtual machines can ensure the resiliency of the peer-to-peer communication network both by their very use and by providing service isolation. For hands-on research, OpenVZ as a Linux implementation of OS-level virtualization has been used.
