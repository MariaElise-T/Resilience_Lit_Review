AbstractIn existing dynamic market place, supply chain disruptions have become a common phenomenon. Emergence of new technologies coupled with variable customer demand and uncertain pandemic has fueled the disruptions across the supply chain ecosystem. To cater the unanticipated disruptions, supply chains of every business has to be circular and sustainable and construction industry is no exception to this. The present study concentrates on identifying the major performance indicators of resilient Construction Supply Chain (CSC) and prioritize the most significant ones. Fuzzy–Decision Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to reveal the influential relationship of performance indicators on the resilience level in CSCs. Further, a strategy map is prepared to highlight the organizational strategy and cause‐effect approach. The findings from study revealed that maintaining appropriate security level, strong collaboration among supply chain partners, efficient supply chain designs, ability to detect discrepancies, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities, and conservation of resources to facilitate sustainable operations are the top seven performance indicators that are evident in the causal group for sustainable CSC. In the effect group, prominent performance indicators are flexibility, financial strength, and efficient allocation of resources. The study adds on to the existing literature by identifying and analyzing significant performance indicators for establishing resilient, sustainable and circular practices in the construction industry.
