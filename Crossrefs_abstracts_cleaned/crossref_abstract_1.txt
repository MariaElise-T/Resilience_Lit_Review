A considerable gap exists between rural and urban children in their mental health outcomes that has continued to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the critical role of school counselors in addressing this gap, we tested the effectiveness of a 10-week, expressive arts-based resiliency program, Resilient Warriors, with 46 rural elementary students. Results revealed a significant increase in studentsâ€™ resilience and well-being posttest scores. We discuss practical implications for school counseling practitioners.
