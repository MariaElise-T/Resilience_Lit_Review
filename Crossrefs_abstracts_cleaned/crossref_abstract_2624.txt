IntroductionBoth resilient coping strategies and the structural/functional characteristics of personal social networks are considered important factors when facing adversity and the challenges inherent to the aging process.ObjectivesTo analyze the association between the configurations of ego-centred networks and different levels of resilient coping in a sample of elderly people.MethodsQuantitative, cross-sectional study comparing groups, with 512 participants, mostly women (n = 325; 63.5%), married (n = 264; 51.5%), with 76 years old in average (SD ± 7.6), and with basic education (n = 261; 51%). We used a socio-demographic questionnaire, the IARSP-Elderly (personal social network assessment tool) and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale for data collection.ResultsWe found different levels of resilient coping in our sample: low (50.4%); medium (38,7%); strong (10.9%). These three levels of coping were associated with the composition of ego-centred networks, namely the proportion of friends and colleagues (P < 0.05), different perceived emotional support, reciprocity and satisfaction with the network (P < 0.05), frequency of contacts and relationships’ durability (P < 0.05).ConclusionsHigher levels of coping are associated with a larger proportion of friends in the network, whereas the familistic networks are associated with low coping. Although participants in our study revealed mainly kin comprised networks, these results reflect the relevance of resilient coping in the activation of non-kin relationships in old age.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
