Based on the theory of dynamic ability, this paper empirically analyzes the mechanism of entrepreneurial traitsand organizational resilience using 527 valid questionnaires of start-up entrepreneurs. It has been found that the higher the innovation trait of individual entrepreneurs, the higher their organizational stability; the higher their individual risk-taking trait, the higher their organizational resilience; and the higher their individual proactivity, the higher their organizational resilience. Environmental dynamics play a positive moderating role between entrepreneurial traitsand organizational resilience. A highly dynamic environment is more conducive for entrepreneurs to build a highly resilient organization with entrepreneurial qualities. New startups can use entrepreneurial traitsas an important way to increase organizational resilience, to empower organizational building, to improve the adaptability of the corporate environment, and to develop better in a dynamic environment.
