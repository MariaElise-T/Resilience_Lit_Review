Purpose
 – Obesity and obesity-related health problems are a growing concern for many immigrants in the USA. The literature that examines the linkages between acculturation, resilience, obesity health risks, and obesity outcomes among Black African immigrants is sparse. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether the predictor variable of acculturation showed a significant association with two criterion variables, obesity health risk symptoms, and obesity; and whether resilience acted as a moderator between acculturation, obesity health risk symptoms, and obesity among Black African immigrants living in the USA. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – The study consisted of a quantitative correlational survey research design. Participants of the study were 55 Black African immigrants residing in three metropolitan areas of the USA. 


Findings
 – Higher levels of acculturation were associated with fewer obesity health risks. Higher levels of resilience were associated with the fewest obesity health risks when the participant also had high-acculturation levels. Resilience moderated between acculturation and obesity health risk symptoms. Neither acculturation nor resilience significantly predicted obesity. Furthermore, resilience did not moderate between acculturation and obesity. 


Research limitations/implications
 – A primary limitation was the very small sample size of the study. Future research would be needed to examine the overall determinants of obesity among immigrant populations. Furthermore, one limitation is that some of the questions on the Weight-Related Symptom Measure (Patrick et al., 2004) were sensitive in nature, and participants might have felt uncomfortable providing information about their weight. As a result, while self-reporting, they could have underestimated their body mass index status. For example, individuals who were already overweight or obese might have reported their body weights with lower accuracy than those who were of normal weight, thereby creating error in the dependent variable. 


Practical implications
 – Results from this study will help to promote health initiatives in Black African immigrant communities to link individuals to needed healthcare services. 


Originality/value
 – The literature that examines the linkages between acculturation, resilience, obesity health risks, and obesity outcomes among Black African immigrants is sparse. This study is the first to use the Reserve Capacity Model for a sample of Black African immigrants.
