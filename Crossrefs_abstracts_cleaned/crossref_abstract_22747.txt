AbstractObjectiveWomen living with and beyond breast cancer (BC) frequently encounter cancer‐related information in day‐to‐day life. The extent they are emotionally resilient to this information differs between women. Identifying key modifiable psychological mechanisms predicting resilience in these women could highlight targets for interventions to improve resilience in others. This study investigates resilience over time in women living beyond BC and how this relates to individual differences in the way the brain processes information.MethodsSeventy women within a year of finishing first‐line treatment for BC (clinical and community recruitment) completed computerised tasks to assess the tendency to attend to cancer information (dot‐probe task), the tendency to draw negative cancer‐related interpretations from ambiguous information (ambiguous scenarios task) and extent of executive functioning (attentional network task). Questionnaires were completed assessing resilience, and other clinically relevant psychological variables (fear of cancer recurrence, distress, quality of life, and worry) at the time of the laboratory tasks (T1) and again 6 months later (T2).ResultsThe only cognitive process associated with self‐reported resilience was interpretation bias. Generating more negative cancer‐related interpretations of ambiguous information at T1 significantly predicted resilience at T2, whilst controlling for T1 resilience and other clinically relevant variables. Furthermore, resilience scores were relatively stable over time and moderately correlated with other clinically relevant variables.ConclusionsThis study is the first to identify a key cognitive mechanism that predicts resilience in women living beyond BC. This finding suggests interventions to reduce cancer‐related interpretations of ambiguous information could promote resilience in women living beyond BC.
