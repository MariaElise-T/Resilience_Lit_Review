Abstract
Wheat is the majorly cultivated staple crop worldwide. The world witnesses a great percentage of yield loss of wheat due to drought stress. The present study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of phytosynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) in contributing to drought resilience in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under rain-fed conditions. FeONPs were biosynthesized by using leaf extract of Prosopis cineraria as a reducing and capping agent. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized to evaluate the structural and biochemical aspects. The FeONPs were found to be irregularly spherical in shape with a mean size of 42.6 nm. The concentration of nanoparticles in the sample was found to be 164.01 mg l−1. An experimental setup was laid out in a randomized-plot design with 3 replications for Rabi season 2020–2021. Five dosages of nanoparticles were prepared as 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 ppm from the stock solution. The wheat crop varieties grown in the field were subjected to a total of 3 treatments; Nanopriming, foliar application of FeONPs at seedling development stage (20 DAS), and tillering stage (30 DAS). Plants that were not treated with NPs were considered as control. No irrigation regime was followed as the effect of NPs on the crop was to be assessed under rain-fed conditions only. Plant growth parameters were recorded. The obtained results revealed that the application of FeONPs positively affected all the morphological and yield attributes in the wheat crop. The highest concentrations used were found to be most effective and showed a significantly pronounced effect as compared to the control at p ≤ 0.05. The study concluded that the FeONPs can contribute to drought resilience in wheat.
