In the Western and in the Mediterranean cities a broad reading of cultural dynamics, together with the overlapping of the historical layers and an historical-based reading of cities and territories, allows readers to identify the presence of a continuous combination of dynamics of urban and cultural resilience. Appearing in bibliographies separately only in recent decades, urban and cultural resilience, social-economical system (SES) and adaptive circles can be used to theorise structural patterns recurring over time in specific contexts. This essay highlights the resilient structure of urban developments, cultural expressions, design, arts, quality gastronomic products, diffused craftsmanship and diffused know-how in the second half of the 20th century in Italy, delineating some resilient future perspectives for the continuation of these dynamics.
