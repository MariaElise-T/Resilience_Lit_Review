 The purposed of this study was to investigate variations in family resilience across individualsâ€™ sociodemographic characteristics, psychological and health resources, and social capital. Using the Tailored Design Method, survey data were collected from rural residents in a single U. S. state which yielded 812 responses and a 30% response rate. Family resilience was measured by the 2015 Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire. The other variables were measured by prevalent existing instruments and standard survey items. A three-model regression analysis was conducted. Results indicated that 37% of the variance in family resilience was explained by the independent variables of social capital, including trust, overall health, depressive symptoms, optimism and life satisfaction, and the control variables of socioeconomic-demographic characteristics. The strongest predictor of family resilience was optimism. In almost all instances, the control variables were weaker predictors than the independent variables, particularly depressive symptoms and social capital. The study sheds light on possible ways for helping professionals to guide families in becoming more resilient and calls for a social determinants of health, culturally sensitive and trauma-informed approach.
