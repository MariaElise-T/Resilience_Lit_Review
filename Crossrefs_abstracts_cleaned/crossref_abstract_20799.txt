Since the first confirmed case, COVID-19 has spread rapidly in Korea. Furthermore, as social distancing has been implemented per quarantine guidelines, the virus has had various social and economic effects. Previous studies assess the resilience of the local community to measure the degree of economic damage caused by COVID-19 and to evaluate the ability of the community to return to a pre-pandemic state. To determine spatial characteristics and factors influencing resilience, the current study investigates the effects of COVID-19 on unemployment within the four-stage spread period of the outbreak. Differences were observed in regional resilience at each stage and location and the characteristics of resilience also differed temporally. Based on the results, the spatial change trend of resilience and factors affecting resilience from short- and long-term perspectives after the impact and suggest implications for future policies were derived.
