Global warming is a constant threat to coastal communities and rising sea levels and increased flooding in these areas. Flooding contributes to the damage and loss of historically and culturally significant structures and buildings, which are an important component in strengthening community longevity and resilience. This study examines the ways world heritage cities mitigate disaster risk, specifically flood risk. It uses the city of Savannah, Georgia as a case study to examine how incorporating historic preservation into flood risk planning is a vital part of flood risk resilience. By examining existing flood maps, projected sea level rise risk areas, and subtropical storm flood patterns in relation to the locations of recorded historical and archaeological sites and structures, this study identifies historically significant African American sites and buildings mapped as low-risk for some flood risks, but high risk for other flood risks, which raises the need for more representation and equity in the protection and cultural representation of historically marginalized groups.
