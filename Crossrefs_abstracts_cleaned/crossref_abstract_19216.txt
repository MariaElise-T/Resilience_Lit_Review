Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) virus causes the COVID-19 pandemic globally. The city of Bandung is the city that became the cluster of Covid-19 spread after DKI Jakarta at the beginning of the pandemic. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) was developed to assess countriesâ€™ readiness to face a pandemic. The index obtained shows that globally the value of this readiness is still minimal. In improving community health system services, health system resilience has been developed and studied in recent years. This study conducted a preliminary evaluation of the Bandung City health system in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic using the concept of resilience. This research uses the West Java and Bandung City Health Office website. Methods used for evaluating the health system resiliency are comparing the cases of Covid-19 at the sub-district to the health facilities, the incidence of infectious diseases in 2019, and the socio-economic conditions of each sub-district. Research shows that the health system in Bandung City has not met the targets in the 2018-2023 Regional Medium-Term Development Plan. Overall, the initial research on the Bandung City health system still does not meet the criteria for resilience.
