AbstractThis study investigated the intraindividual variability in daily posttraumatic growth (PTG) versus posttraumatic depreciation (PTD), positive and negative affect (PA and NA), and HIV/AIDS stigma among people living with HIV (PLWH). In particular, we examined whether this variability derives from participants’ resilience operationalized on a trait level. The participants included 67 PLWH, who completed a baseline questionnaire on resilience, measured with the Brief Resilience Scale. Following this, they completed the shortened versions of the following inventories over five consecutive days: the Posttraumatic Growth and Posttraumatic Depreciation Inventory V Expanded version Inventory, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, and the Berger HIV Stigma Scale. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized to analyze the study results. We observed significant intraindividual variability in PTG, PTD, PA, NA, and perceived HIV/AIDS stigma. Resilience was related to PTG, PTD, PA, and NA but not to stigma. Moreover, higher resilience was associated with higher, stabler PA and lower, stabler NA. Our results highlight the need of further studies on the daily functioning of PLWH. Specifically, while health status is important, it does not appear to be the predominant source of everyday distress for PLWH. Consequently, psychological counselling for PLWH should concentrate more on the life of the person as a whole and not only on coping with HIV infection.
