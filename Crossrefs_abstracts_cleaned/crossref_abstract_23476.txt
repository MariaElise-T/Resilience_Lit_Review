ABSTRACTBoolean functions play an important role in the design of stream ciphers. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm is designed to obtain Boolean functions satisfying all the needed criteria: high nonlinearity, 1‐resiliency, optimal algebraic degree, optimal (or suboptimal) algebraic immunity, and good immunity to fast algebraic attacks. These functions provide a good trade‐off among the criteria to resist the known cryptanalytic techniques. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
