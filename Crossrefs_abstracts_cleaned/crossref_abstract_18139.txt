Abstract
Ecological-phytocoenotic features of Rubus arcticus L. were estimated near the Southern border of the range, ecological range of the species was also defined. According to the scale of soil humidity fluctuation the conditionsâ€™ range of the studied populations is wider than given by D N Tsyganov (1983). According to the complex of ecological scales, R. arcticus is a mesobiont species. Light-shading scale states euryvalent properties, and cumulative spectrum of soil scales shows its stenobiont features. Based on phytoindication data and according to the discomfort index, the most favourable conditions of edapho- and climatope for R. arcticus are formed in graminoid-mixed herbs wet meadow on forest aisle surrounded by birch-aspen bilberry forest and in spruce-birch mixed herbs-graminoid swampy forest. Hemeroby studies showed that the species has low resilience to human impact and can tolerate moderate anthropogenic influence.
