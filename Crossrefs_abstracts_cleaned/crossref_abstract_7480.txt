The Covid-19 pandemic has huge impact on business environment throughout the globe, particularly it posed many challenges for healthcare sector. There are about 219 known viruses which can cause diseases to the human beings and researchers estimate that this number is like one drop of ocean. In the past twenty years, there are many virus outbreaks like SARS, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola and Zika. These pandemics registered billions of cases and lakhs of deaths, fortunately the mortality is less due to less spread. But the recent outbreak of Corona virus registered around 61.8Cr cases and 65.5L deaths worldwide and the mortality rate is above one percent. Till now these seven viruses caused around 1Cr deaths and there are 200 plus known and thousands of unknown viruses in the world which may affect mankind in the future. Therefore, the health system in each country should prepare them to face the pandemic situations. WHO also provided policy recommendations to build resilience in the health system. Health system can be resilient when every healthcare organisation becomes resilient. There are four stages in pandemic shocks and each stage requires different resilient characteristics like adaptative, responsive, collaborative, informative, accountable etc. In this context the current research is conducted to study the role of agile employees in building hospital resilience.
