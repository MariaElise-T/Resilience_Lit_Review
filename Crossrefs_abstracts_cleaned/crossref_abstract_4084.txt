Network reconfiguration is an effective way to avoid severe, large-scale power outages and to improve the resilience of active distribution networks (ADNs). Furthermore, the rapid development of distributed energy resources (DERs) provides new perspectives for network reconfiguration. In this paper, the effect of network reconfiguration and DER collaboration on ADNâ€™s resilient restoration are studied. The applications of DERs are fully explored. In order to achieve a better resilient performance, a detailed multiperiod model considering both reconfiguration and multiple DERs is established. Some linearization techniques are used to simplify the proposed model. Then, we build a rolling horizon optimization framework to solve the model. The framework eliminates the adverse effect of prediction errors and speeds up the calculation. By introducing predictions into strategy determination, the framework achieves a better restoration effect than the traditional greedy method. The proposed framework is tested on a 33-bus system. The simulations verify the efficiency of our work.
