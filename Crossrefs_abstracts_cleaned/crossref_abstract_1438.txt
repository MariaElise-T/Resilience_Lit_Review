Purpose The aim of this research is to examine the relationship between spiritual leadership and employee resilience. Specifically, this research explores how meaning mediates the relationship between spiritual leadership and employee resilience.Design/methodology/approach This quantitative study collected data from the 439 respondents using a seven-point Likert scale. Structural equation modeling was employed to test the relationship among spiritual leadership, meaning and employee resilience.Findings The results shows that spiritual leadership, directly and indirectly, influences employee resilience. Spiritual leadership also instills meaning among employees through exhibiting genuine concern and communicating a shared vision. This research also demonstrates that meaning cultivates employee resilience to survive and thrive in a challenging business environment.Practical implications First, organizations should assess, incorporate and promote altruistic values and shared vision in their leadership program and staffing process. Second, this study urges leaders and managers to create meaning in the workplace. Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the daily routines and order that humans are accustomed to, causing distressing circumstances for many people. This research calls for spiritual leadership to respond proactively by providing employees with support, appreciation and direction in those times.Originality/value This research moves forward the extant academic discussion on spiritual leadership, meaning and employee resilience in two ways. First, this study adds empirical evidence to the relationship between spiritual leadership and employee resilience, which has drawn scant attention from scholars. Second, this research buttresses the proposed framework from the perspective of positive psychology and broaden-and-build theory.
