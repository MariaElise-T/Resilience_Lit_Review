Purpose
The purpose of this research is to provide a strategic framework for business resilience plans (BRPs) to guide micro, small, and medium-sized firms (MSMEs) in determining their adaptability level and providing information on agility and resilience tactics while coping with turbulence.


Design/methodology/approach
A systematic literature review (SLR) is used in this work to collect and acquire a complete and high-quality sample of academic journal articles. As the primary focus, 63 high-quality journals were chosen from 154 academic papers in the Scopus and Web of Science databases by using qualitative data analysis. The method of thematic analysis incorporating grounded approach analysis was utilized for creating themes and key findings in this study.


Findings
This study proposes the dimensions of the BRPs framework along with key findings to identify future research directions for MSMEs. The three dimensions of BRP include responsiveness, reactiveness, and proactiveness based on the principles of agility, absorption, and resilience.


Originality/value
This study proposes a sustainable and resilient framework for post-disaster MSMEs as a catalyst towards sustainably resilient MSMEs. This study highlights viable avenues for future research for academics and provides a resilient plan at various levels for business owner-managers.
