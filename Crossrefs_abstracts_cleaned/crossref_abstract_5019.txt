ABSTRACTThis qualitative research examines how Nigeria, Seychelles, and South Africa applied technologies to mediate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on their education systems. The research demonstrates that sociocultural and institutional factors, and attitudes of stakeholders, rather than technological access, significantly determined the countriesâ€™ capacity to transition tertiary institutions online at the height of the pandemic. It expands the understanding of the role of institutions and policies in the adoption of education technologies. The research findings are expected to inform the articulation of relevant policies and system-wide strategies for resilience and antifragility in case of future societal disruptions.
