Improving plant resilience to changing environmental conditions is the primary focus of today’s scientific research globally. It is essential to find various strategies for the better survival of plants with higher resistance potential to climate change. Strigolactones (SLs) are multifunctional β-carotene derivative molecules that determine a range of plant growth and development aspects, such as root architecture, shoot branching, chlorophyll synthesis, and senescence. SLs facilitate strong defense responses against drought, salinity, heavy metal, nutrient starvation, and heat stress. The SLs trigger other hormonal-responsive pathways and determine plant resilience against stressful environments. This review focuses on the mechanisms regulated by SLs and interaction with other plant hormones to regulate plant developmental processes and SLs’ influence on the mitigation of plant damage under abiotic stresses. A better understanding of the signaling and perception of SLs may lead to the path for the sustainability of plants in the changing environmental scenario. The SLs may be considered as an opening door toward sustainable agriculture.
