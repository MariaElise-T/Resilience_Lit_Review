Education is a basic right for every Indonesian citizen. However, in reality, education in Indonesia is not evenly distributed so that many residents in certain regions or areas such as the 3T area still do not get proper education either in terms of facilities or infrastructure so that many students from the 3T area choose education outside the 3T area which has a good education. worthy of both facilities and infrastructure. The challenge that must be faced by students from the 3T area is that they have to adapt and adjust to the learning method of being a student which is quite a difficult challenge for students from the 3T area. Low peer social support can affect individual academic resilience. Therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between peer social support and academic resilience in students from the 3T areas. The method used in this study is quantitative, with a correlational design to determine the relationship between peer social support and academic resilience. Participants in this study were students from the 3T area, totaling 140 people, aged between 17-25 years, who studied at Satya Wacana Christian University. The sampling technique used in this study is snowball sampling. The research measurement uses two scales, namely the Peer Support Questionnaire (a = 0.930) and The Academic Resilience Scale (a = 0.853). The results of the study prove that peer social support is positively related to academic resilience (r=0.399) with sig. = 0.000)
