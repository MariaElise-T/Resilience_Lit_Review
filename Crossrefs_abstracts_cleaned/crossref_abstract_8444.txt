Research on the frequency of health-related behaviors performed by people after COVID-19 and its relationship with personal resources, personality traits and positive orientation to other people are intended to shed new light on the situation of convalescents after suffering from the disease. The purpose of this thesis was to identify and determine the relationship between moral dimension of the Light Triad, resilience and health behaviors among COVID-19 convalescents. The study involved 204 people aged 18 to 75 years who reported having COVID-19 disease. Each respondent was asked to complete an identical set of survey tools, which consisted of: survey information, metrics and three tools to determine the level of surveyed variables. These were the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Light Triad Scale (LTS) and the Health Behaviors Inventory (IZZ). Studies have shown that there are statistically significant associations between resilience, the Light Triad and health behaviors among COVID-19 convalescents. Resilience and the Light Triad have been found to be predictors of health behaviors in the COVID-19 recovery group, which means that individuals who treat adversity as developmental challenges and are positively oriented towards other people in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease show a higher level of health behaviors after the disease.
