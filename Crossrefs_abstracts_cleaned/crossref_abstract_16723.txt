 Peer violence in school has become a major issue for schools around the world. The present study examined the impacts of cultural settings and of protective individual attributes on peer bullying and victimization in school. These protective attributes were self-esteem, sense of autonomy, emotional regulation, and individual resilience. Participants were 112 Jewish and 55 Arab Bedouin pupils 10 to 11 years old. It was hypothesized that Jewish pupils would score lower than Bedouin pupils on bullying and on victimization, and will score higher than them on these protective individual attributes. It was also hypothesized that despite these differences, the investigated attributes would correlate with reduced peer violence in both groups. It was hypothesized further that individual resilience will be the major predictor of both bullying and victimization in both groups. Results have generally supported these hypotheses, suggesting alternative ways for curtailing peer aggression in school.
