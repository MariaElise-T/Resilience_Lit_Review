 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Two years into the pandemic, there have been over one million COVID-19 deaths in the United States alone. While the pandemic has impacted everyone, the most extreme impacts have been experienced by marginalized communities, including those who identify as LGBTQIA+. Although LGBTQIA+ people have faced the negative impacts of the pandemic, the LGBTQIA+ community may be well equipped to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic due to the historic and current societal oppression this community has endured. Using both a resilience and resistance framework, the present study explores the resilience and resistance strategies employed by LGBTQIA+ adults in the Southeast U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic through the collection and analysis of monthly diary entries and video interviews. Findings show that resilience and resistance build on the knowledge base and histories of LGBTQIA+ people, and resilience and resistance have been re-imagined for this community during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many LGBTQIA+ people are dreaming of and re-imagining a better future, a future that social work educators and practitioners can help co-create.
