ABSTRACT  Objective: To analyze the relationship between leadership coaching and nurses’ resilience in hospital environments.  Method: This is a cross-sectional study, carried out with nurses, nursing assistants and technicians. Nurses answered the Nurse Self-Perception Questionnaire in Leadership Exercise Questionnaire (QUAPEEL) and the Connor-Davidson Scale for Brazil-25 (CD-RISC-25BRASIL). Nursing technicians/assistants answered the Nursing Technician and Assistant Perception in Leadership Exercise Questionnaire (QUEPTAEEL). Student’s t test and Pearson’s correlation were used (p ≤ 0.05).  Results: There was a statistically significant difference between nurses’ self-perception and nursing technicians/assistants’ hetero-perception in coaching leadership exercise for the total score (p = 0.002) and in the “Give and receive feedback” (p < 0.001), “Delegate power and exert influence” (p < 0.001) and “Support the team so that the organizational results are reached” (p = 0.020) domains. There was a statistically significant correlation between all the Nurse Self-Perception Questionnaire in Leadership Exercise Questionnaire Coaching and Resilience domains.  Conclusion: Resilience was positively related to nurses’ self-perception of coaching leadership.
