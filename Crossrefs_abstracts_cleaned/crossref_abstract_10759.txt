Achieving employees resilience is critically a function of effective administrative bureaucracy, thus this study examined how administrative bureaucracy impacts employee resilience in public in institutions in Delta State. The study was operationalized with attributes such as structural hierarchy, functional specialization and rule supremacy. Employee resilience outcomes were derived as adaptation, collaboration and discipline.  The target population of this study includes all principal officers of the eight public institutions in Delta State. The study used cross-sectional survey approach and descriptive research design. Using the Taro-Yamene sample size determination formula 121 officers were sampled. Structured closed ended questionnaires were the major instruments used in gathering primary data which were analyzed using pearson product moment correlation coefficient statistical tool. The scale used for this study had been previously adjudged reliable. However, we also checked  by verifying reliability outcomes through confirmatory test of internal consistency on the instrument with our sample using Cronbach alpha at the threshold level 0.7 which is generally accepted by the rule of thumb. The study found that administrative bureaucracy significantly impact on employee resilience.
