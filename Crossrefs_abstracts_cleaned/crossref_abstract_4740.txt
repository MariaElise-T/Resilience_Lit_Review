School burnout is a common problem in students. Therefore, it is a situation that negatively affects students. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of psychological resilience (PR) in the relationship between quality of school life (QSL) and school burnout (SB). The data of the study were collected by using the “QSL Scale”, “SB Scale” and “PR Scale”. The study group of the current study is comprised of a total of 325 middle school students aged 10 to 15. Of these 325 students, 163 (50.2%) are females, and 162 (49.8%) are males. In the analysis of the collected data, correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis were used. As a result of the SEM analysis, it was found that QSL has a positive effect on PR and a negative effect on SB. PR was found to have a negative effect on SB. Moreover, PR was found to have a partially mediator role in the relationship between QSL and SB.  Overall, it can be argued that improving students’ perception of QSL will have positive effects on their PR and on their attempts to cope with SB.
