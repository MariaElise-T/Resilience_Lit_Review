The primary objective of the study was to examine the relationship between abusive supervision and somatic complaints and work place cognitive failure. Study also intended to investigate the moderating role of resilience in these associations among sanitary workers. Cross-sectional survey data was gathered through purposive sampling technique, a sample of 662 sanitary workers from six different cities of Pakistan participated in the research. The research findings demonstrated that abusive supervision has significant positive correlation with somatic complaints and work place cognitive failure. Additionally, the negative correlation between resilience (moderator) and both somatic complaints and workplace cognitive failure was found significant. However, the hypothesized moderating influences of resilience on both the models of abusive supervision were not supported significantly. The study can contribute to promote awareness regarding sanitary workersâ€™ problems and to make necessary modification at policy level, by the concerned authorities, to improve their quality of life by eliminating stressors from workplaces.
