The purpose of this qualitative study was to gather the perspectives of educational leaders in the United States and Australia on strategies for transforming an almost exclusively Westernized curriculum into a curriculum that honors Indigenous worldviews. The research design was exploratory in nature and involved an examination of the ways in which culturally sustaining leadership may be employed to support the resilience of Indigenous students across borders. The methodologies of dialogue and reflection provided a way to engage participants in an international exchange. Participants were 11 aspiring administrators enrolled in an educational leadership program in the United States and five visiting educators from Australia. Participants pre-assessed their understandings about culturally relevant curriculum, engaged in dialogue, submitted journal reflections, and presented final testimonies. Findings from the thematic analysis revealed the value of designing curriculum grounded in cultural humility and a holistic worldview. Respondents concluded curriculum must be linked to the resiliency of Indigenous students and focused on the interconnected relationships of country, place, culture, and people. The implications suggest there is an opportunity for systemic change when networks of Indigenous leaders and allies come together in a global exchange of ideas. These findings may be important for other collaborators who aim to draw upon the knowledge traditions of Indigenous communities across borders. Additional multicountry study is needed to expand the knowledge base and make Indigenous worldviews central to the mission of schools and communities in the United States and across borders.
