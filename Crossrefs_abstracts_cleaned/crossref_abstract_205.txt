Home healthcare (HHC) nurses are experiencing stress and burnout related to high workloads, isolation on the job, and COVID-19 restrictions. A literature review found numerous interventions effective in reducing nurse burnout through building resiliency and decreasing moral distress. The purpose of this evidence-based project was to improve resiliency and decrease the risk of burnout in HHC nurses through the introduction of a resiliency bundle. The following resiliency bundle interventions were implemented: a) gratitude strategies, b) connecting with co-workers, c) storytelling, and d) resiliency training. Duffy's Quality-Caring Model and Neal's Theory of Home Health Nursing Practice framed the project. The interventions were implemented in an HHC department at a large Midwestern pediatric hospital. Outcomes were measured using a pre- and postimplementation resiliency and burnout survey, which used a Likert scale to allow for quantitative analysis. Fourteen nurses completed the presurvey, 11 completed the postsurvey, and 10 completed both pre- and postsurveys. Results showed no statistically significant change in resiliency or burnout after implementation; however, nurses expressed desire to continue using the bundle pieces, especially the gratitude strategies, connecting with co-workers, and sharing stories. Leadership should take burnout risk in HHC nurses seriously and look for innovative ways to promote resiliency.
