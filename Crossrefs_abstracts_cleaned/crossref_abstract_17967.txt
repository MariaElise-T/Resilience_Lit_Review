IntroductionResilience is commonly defined as positive adaptation to adverse events or as the ability to maintain or regain mental health after exposure to difficulties. According to the bio-psycho-social model, resilience is influenced by self-esteem, coping strategies and personality traits. In schizophrenic patients, resilience seems to affect real-life functioning, while in mood disorders, resilience influences the longitudinal course of the disorder, reducing the frequency of relapses and improving drugs response.ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to asses levels of resilience and self-esteem, coping strategies, perceived quality of life and temperament characteristics in a sample composed by patients with major depressive disorder and patients affected by schizophrenia.MethodsWe collected a sample composed by 40 patients with major depressive disorder and 40 patients affected by schizophrenia patients recruited at the “Maggiore della Carità” Hospital in Novara, Italy. The assessment protocol included: Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory–Brief (BRIEF–COPE), Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES), Paykel List Of Stressful Events, Temperamental and Character Inventory (TCI) and Short form 36 (SF-36). Comparison of qualitative data was performed by means of the χ2, a t-test was performed for continuous normal-distribution variables otherwise a non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was performed. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05.ConclusionsIn patients with major depressive disorder resilience were associated with a good self-perception of physical and mental health, higher self-esteem levels and problem-focused/emotion focused coping strategies. In schizophrenic patients, sample there was no positive correlation between resilience and perceived quality of life. Further implications will be discussed.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
