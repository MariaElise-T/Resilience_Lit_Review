AbstractSoutheast Asia is one of the world's most energy‐intensive and climate vulnerable regions, with rapid urbanization and industrialization increasing its greenhouse gas emissions and a high exposure to extreme weather events. The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a massive impact on the region's economic growth. Decisions taken by leaders today to revive economies will either entrench the region's dependence on fossil fuels or accelerate decarbonization efforts to achieve the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. This article recalls the imperative of a green, climate resilient recovery from the COVID‐19 pandemic to put ASEAN economies on a sustainable and inclusive development path before discussing the chronic infrastructure investment gap and reviewing options to catalyze climate investment to address this gap and finance recovery efforts.
