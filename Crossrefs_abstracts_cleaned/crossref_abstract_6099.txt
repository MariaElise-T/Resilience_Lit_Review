Industry 4.0 refers to a series of technologies, principles, and methods to make manufacturing systems more autonomous, evolving, adaptable, and precise. The proposed hypotheses is the impact of Industry 4.0 practices have positive impact on supply chain resilience and different Artificial Intelligence techniques are incorporated that have positive impact on supply chain resilience. The findings of the study indicates that Industry 4.0 technologies, i.e Artificial Intelligence, has a substantial influence on supply chain and its resilience.
