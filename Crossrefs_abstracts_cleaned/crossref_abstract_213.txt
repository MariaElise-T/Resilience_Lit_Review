AbstractThe potential for rising groundwater is an important consideration in any coastal resiliency assessment. Unlike other groundwater modeling that focuses mostly on contaminant tracking, coastal groundwater resiliency assessments are primarily concerned with the potential for groundwater emergence induced by sea level rise. This provides more options for modelers that range from simplified water table elevation models to fully integrated groundwater and storm water models. The selection is dependent on available data and project needs. However, despite the relative simplicity of some of the techniques, all the methods benefit from a professional with hydrogeological training.
