Modern power grids have high levels of distributed energy resources, automation, and inherent flexibility. Those characteristics have been proven to be favorable from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Despite the increased versatility, modern grids are becoming more vulnerable to high-impact low-probability (HILP) threats, particularly for the distribution networks. On one hand, this is due to the increasing frequency and severity of weather events and natural disasters. On the other hand, it is aggravated by the increased complexity of smart grids. Resilience is broadly defined as the capability of a system to mitigate the effects of and recover from HILP events, which is often confused with reliability that is concerned with low-impact high-probability (LIHP) ones. In this paper, a distribution system in Portugal is simulated to showcase how the utilization of flexibility and mobile energy resources (MERs) should be considered differently relative to HILP vs LIHP threats.
