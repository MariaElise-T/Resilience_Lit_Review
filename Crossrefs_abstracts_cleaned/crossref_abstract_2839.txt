 The lived experiences of being resilient as described by 13 single Taiwanese mothers after divorce was the focus of this study. A descriptive phenomenological approach to inquiry was the theoretical framework underpinning the study. Information was gathered through two in-depth face-to-face digitally recorded interviews with each participant. Each of the participants had suffered from depression. For the analysis of the participants’ transcripts of interview the authors used Colaizzi’s method. Four themes emerged from the analysis process: having faith in God, bending with the ebb and flow of daily life, finding strength in the support and friendship of others, and new found freedom and hope for the future. Findings of this study have the potential to enhance understanding of the mental health needs of single mothers and their children in the provision of holistic health care delivery.
