Studies of risk and vulnerability processes may provide important ways of identifying new treatment targets – based on the principle that mending something is much easier if you know in what way it is broken. However, in our field, knowing its source may not always tell us about how to remediate impairment. Studies focusing on resilience may be more informative from this perspective. In this editorial I discuss four papers that highlight the value of resilience studies from a translational perspective – in particular contrasting the strengths and limitations of observational and experimental designs.
