Mixed-use heterogeneous urban fabrics have been shown to be more adaptable to continuous urban change than mono-functional homogeneous ones. More specifically, studies on high street cases have highlighted the positive role of ‘morphological mix’ for maintaining a continuous balance between urban robustness and adaptability, which is a definition of urban resilience. However, the particular linear condition of high streets allows only for a partial analysis of typo-morphological synergies within complex adaptive processes. This paper investigates how typo- morphological diversity (TMD) affects the adaptive process of urban fabrics facing contextual changes in the case of three central heterogeneous urban blocks along the canal in Brussels. These urban blocks are characterized by a high degree of TMD at street, plot and building levels and by significant changes through time in all of these typo-morphological components. A comparative morphogenetic analysis c.1866–2022 reveals that, while undergoing similar contextual changes, the specific spatial configurations of each block have led to different morphological transformations. However, beyond the specificities of each block, the comparative analysis highlights recurrent typo-morphological processes and reveals the particular impact of public space status and design on TMD development and evolution.
