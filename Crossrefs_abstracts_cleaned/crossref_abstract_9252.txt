 Purpose: The lived experiences of Native American elders regarding the effects of stereotypes on resilience were examined. Method: This qualitative study emphasized culturally compatible methods of traditional storytelling and featured interpretive analysis. Results: Themes revealed were the following: (a) having the ability to successfully bridge cultures fostered resilience and inspired self-confidence, (b) a strong sense of identity was a core element of resilience, (c) being responsible and accountable inspired a sense of pride, (d) educational attainment and employment fostered resilience, and (e) cultural resilience was a key component when confronting stereotypes. Although stereotyping has had profound effects, these first Americans have taken the best of both worlds and successfully integrated them to live successful, well-adjusted lives. Discussion: These findings suggest that disparities in mental and physical health could be addressed by building on the unique foundation of cultural resilience embodied by these Native elders.
