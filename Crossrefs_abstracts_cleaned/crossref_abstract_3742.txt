Water distribution networks (WDNs) face various types of hazards during their extended life. Ensuring proper functioning of WDNs has always been a major concern for utility managers because of their impact on public health and safety. Resilience is an emerging concept that aims at maintaining functionality of the WDNs. Most of the previously developed resilience frameworks employed simulation methods to assess resilience of the WDNs, focusing only on the specific aspects of resilience. There is a need to develop a holistic approach to evaluate the resilience of WDNs considering various dimensions of resilience. This paper presents a new multi-attribute resilience metric based on the robustness and redundancy of the WDNs, which can be used to achieve the purpose. The developed metric is used to evaluate the resilience of a WDN in the city of London, Ontario. An optimization framework for enhancing the current resilience level is also presented. Resilience of the network is found to increase around 20% with a $500,000 investment. A hazard scenario is then analyzed to illustrate the practicality of using this metric in selecting effective restoration strategies. The proposed metric can be utilized by water agencies to evaluate and enhance the resilience of WDNs, as well as to optimize the recovery process after disruptive events.
