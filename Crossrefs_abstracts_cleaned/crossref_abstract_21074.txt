Up to two-thirds of older Canadian adults have high nutrition risk, which predisposes them to frailty, hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a brief education intervention on nutrition risk and use of adaptive strategies to promote dietary resilience among community-dwelling older adults living in Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study design was a single-arm intervention trial with preâ€“post evaluation. Participants (N = 28, age 65+ years) in the study completed a survey online or via telephone. Questions included the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), SCREEN-14, a brief poverty screen, and a World Health Organization-guided questionnaire regarding awareness and use of nutrition-related services and resources (S and R). A brief educational intervention involved raising participant awareness of available nutrition S and R. Education was offered via email or postal mail with follow-up surveys administered 3 months later. Baseline and follow-up nutrition risk scores, S and R awareness and use were compared using paired t-test. Three-quarters of participants had a high nutrition risk, but very few reported experiencing financial strain or food insecurity. Those at high nutrition risk were more likely to report eating alone, compared to those who scored as low risk. There was a significant increase in awareness of 20 S and R as a result of the educational intervention, but no change in use. The study shows increasing individual knowledge about services and resources in the community is not sufficient to change use of these services or improve nutrition risk.
