As one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards, flooding can seriously threaten global security and the sustainable development of our communities. Therefore, enhancing the resilience of cities and improving their ability to adapt to flooding have become issues of great significance. This study developed a new comprehensive evaluation model of flood resilience that includes an evaluation index system from the basis of four key dimensions of social resilience, economic resilience, ecological environment resilience and infrastructure resilience. Firstly, interpretative structural modelling (ISM) was applied to analyze the structural issues affecting urban flood resilience. Secondly, the analytic network process (ANP) was then used to calculate the importance of these indicators. Finally, taking three cities (Zhengzhou, Xi’an, and Jinan) in the Yellow River Basin of China as examples, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to evaluate their current levels of flood resilience using the findings from the earlier stages. The results show that the levels of rainfall and vulnerability of groups were the fundamental factors affecting urban flood resilience. Indicators such as average annual rainfall, fixed-asset investments, and emergency rescue capabilities were also found to have a greater impact on urban flood resilience. In the study area, Xi’an was found to have a higher level of resilience due to having strong ecological environmental resilience. These findings are expected to provide a useful reference for policymakers and stakeholders involved in the management of flooding events.
