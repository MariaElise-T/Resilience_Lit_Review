AbstractAim: The principles and practice of recovery are guiding many changes in mental health service provision. As a new Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) service, we were interested in finding out if both staff and users perceive the service as promoting resilience and in turn, recovery.Methods: A naturalistic sample of service users and staff completed the Organizational Climate questionnaire to assess the degree to which the service promotes resilience in overcoming a first episode psychosis.Results: The results indicated that both staff and service users similarly perceive the service as positively supporting resilience. The one exception was the staff rated the ‘available resources to meet people's needs’ as less than service users.Conclusions: The positive rating of resilience indicated that the service is working in a manner consistent with a recovery orientation. The results will act as a benchmark to compare with both other EIP services and future performance.
