Climate change has a considerable impact on weather patterns worldwide. Therefore, planning and decision-making processes based on information on farmers' traditional and indigenous knowledge may no longer be accurate and useful. Respective national and local authorities have not been giving due attention to address this issue, and farmers and their dependents have been facing difficulties to sustain their livelihoods in the face of climate change. To ensure enhanced agro-ecosystem services and functions as part of policy interventions at national and sub-national levels, a 4-day training course was developed and conducted for practitioners and policymakers on "Agro-ecosystem Resilience in a Changing Climate". The training course created a pool of master trainers from government, academia, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in understanding agro-ecosystems, their functions and threats posed to them by weather and climate change in order to build resilience. The target countries were Nepal, Thailand and Sri Lanka. An evaluation questionnaire was developed (Likert scale and short answer types) to analyze participants' feedback and lessons learnt from the training courses. The results were mostly constructive and, in most cases, positive. The attendees gained sufficient knowledge to implement the adaptive measures as well as it opened new avenues of collaboration for the stakeholders.
