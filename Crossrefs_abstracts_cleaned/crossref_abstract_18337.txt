The affairs and concerns relating to the energy sector are versatile, spatially differentiated, and dynamic, due to the determining importance of energy in the everyday life of people, national economy, and wellbeing globally. Climate change with extreme and intense weather phenomena, combined with potential biological hazards, affect energy systems, posing a threat to energy systems' resilience and security. understand the interaction of the above factors affecting energy systems, it is necessary to understand the concepts of vulnerability and resilience. This study aims to review factors of vulnerability and resilience of renewable energy systems (RES). Climate change is a significant factor, considered critical for the resilience of renewable energy infrastructure. Conclusions include courses of action and measures that need to be taken, to build resilience. Suggestions are made, for a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy sector, compatible with contemporary technology and eco-friendly behaviors, mandated by climate change.
