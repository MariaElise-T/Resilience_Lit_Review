Therefore, this paper explores the qualitative analysis method for cultivation of college students’ entrepreneurial resilience from the perspective of entrepreneurial ecological environment. First, the relationship among the main roles in the entrepreneurial ecosystem was shown, the homogeneity-driven integration process of the strategies for college students’ entrepreneurial resilience cultivation was expounded, and a knowledge interaction model for college students’ entrepreneurial resilience cultivation was constructed. Then, a conceptual model of college students’ entrepreneurial heterogeneity was constructed, and a dynamic evolution analysis was performed on the homogenization-oriented complementary adjustment of college students’ entrepreneurial ecological environment. The experiment showed that the empirical results of the constructed model basically met the theoretical expectations. Finally, the experimental results under the completely heterogeneous, generally homogenized and completely homogeneous states were given and discussed, which verified the effectiveness of the homogenization-oriented complementation strategy.
