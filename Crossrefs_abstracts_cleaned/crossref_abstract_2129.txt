The paper argues for nonprofit making corporations that strive to increase resilience against economic challenges through human resource development and strategic training by involving the management in various sections of the human resource management activities. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in an open environment, depend upon external sources for funds and resources to perform robustly. Changes in external environment and internal deficiencies lead to face adverse impacts and collapse of organizations. Very few organizations manage to recover from losses, take advantage from situations and evolve stronger than before. Resilience provides strength to NGOs and help obtain positive future prospects under crisis situations. The study aims to enhance understanding of dynamics and nature of resilience of NGOs. It empirically investigates the effect of factors including transformational leadership that promotes organizational learning, management development, ethics training, systems thinking and social capital and political instability as an external factor on resilience of NGOs. Data have been collected from sample of 200 managerial level employees working in NGOs of Muscat, Oman. The research findings conclude that transformational leadership has a significant positive effect on organizational resilience; whereas, the indirect effect of transformational leadership in the presence of organizational learning as mediator is insignificant, thus exhibits insignificant mediation.
