PurposeThis study aims to investigate the impact of supply chain risk (SCR) information processing capabilities (e.g. SCR information sharing and SCR information analysis) and supply chain finance (SCF) on supply chain resilience, as well as the moderating effect of environmental uncertainty in the relationship between SCF and supply chain resilience.Design/methodology/approachThis paper proposes a theoretical model grounded on the information processing theory. Data collected from 216 Chinese firms are used to test the theoretical model by employing structural equation modelling.FindingsThe findings reveal that SCR information processing capabilities have a significant impact on both SCF and supply chain resilience. SCF plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between SCR information processing capabilities and supply chain resilience. In addition, environmental uncertainty moderates the relationship between SCF and supply chain resilience.Originality/valueFirst, this paper enriches the knowledge of how information processing capability affects SCF and supply chain resilience as the study considers the more granular SCR information rather than general information that has been discussed in previous studies. Second, this is one of the first papers to establish the relationship between SCF and supply chain resilience in emerging economies. Next, the paper extends theÂ theoretical framework of the antecedents and consequences of SCF. Moreover, the study further facilitates the understanding of the role of the external environment in SCR and SCF management.
