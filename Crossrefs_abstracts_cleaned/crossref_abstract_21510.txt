Since the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction began in the 1990s, education has been recognized as having a cross-cutting role in disaster reduction by extending the peopleâ€™s engagement to the creation and maintenance of sustainable communities internationally. During the same period, Japan has experienced large earthquakes, following which Japan has promoted comprehensive school safety and practical disaster education. Although conditions may vary between Japan and other countries, the approaches, issues and challenges of disaster education have much in common. The 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), fully integrates education and includes the overall goal of disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the full disaster management cycle, from prevention, mitigation and preparedness to response, recovery and rehabilitation. Minimizing loss and damage to educational facilities is included as one of global indicators of SFDRR. A comprehensive approach to school safety is emphasized, including the safety of the learning environment, disaster management and DRR education. An awareness of such commonalities, under the SFDRR, international cooperation for promoting education for resilient communities should be promoted in Japan and globally.
