AbstractThe worldwide spread of COVID‐19 has resulted in an enormous threat to public health, causing global panic, especially older adults suffering severe anxiety due to their vulnerability. With a questionnaire survey on 213 Chinese older adults in April 2020, we examined the role of community resilience in protecting older adults from anxiety during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and simultaneously considered the moderating role of trust in local government. The results indicated that community resilience was negatively associated with older adults' anxiety, and this association was weakened for older adults with low trust in local government. This study has implications for intervention designs that combine resilient factors related to communities and local governments to relieve older adults' anxiety during the pandemic.
