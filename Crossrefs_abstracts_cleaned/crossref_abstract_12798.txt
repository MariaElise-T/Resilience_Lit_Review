Psychological resilience is a person's ability to cope with difficulties he/she faces. It is important in terms of being a positive predictor of a person's mental health. Since resilience is associated with social support from the environment, this study aimed to examine the relationship between the support perceived by married individuals from their spouses and their levels of resilience. The Working group consists of 294 married individuals, 73 (24.8%) men and 221 women (72.2%) participating in the research. "Spousal Support Scale," "Short Psychological Resilience Scale," and "Personal Information Form" developed by the researchers to examine socio-demographic characteristics were used to obtain the data. Data were tested with simple linear correlation, simple linear regression, independent sample t-test, and ANOVA test. According to the findings of the study, there is a significant relationship between perceived spousal support and resilience, and spousal support is a significant predictor of resilience. However, while the level of resilience does not differ according to gender, spousal support differs according to gender. While spousal support does not differ according to income level and educational status, psychological resilience differs according to income level but does not differ according to educational status. As a result, the perceived spousal support of married individuals predicts their psychological resilience levels.
