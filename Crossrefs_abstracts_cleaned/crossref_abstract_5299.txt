The primary objective of this research was to investigate the execution of the Nusantara Module program at Universitas Padjadjaran (Unpad), Indonesia, and examine its impact on participating students, emphasizing the programâ€™s adaptability and response to the Cianjur earthquake catastrophe in 2022. This study used a mixed-method approach, combining the qualitative analysis of program papers and communication with the quantitative analysis of post-program surveys and verbatim analysis of student responses. This research revealed systematic methods such as regular meetings, rapid issue resolution, monthly reporting, rigorous evaluation, and post-program surveys. The findings show that students were quite satisfied with the cultural interchange, academic and non-academic learning experiences, hospitality, excursions, and amenities provided. However, areas for improvement were highlighted, including extending module destinations, resolving financial issues, addressing social integration obstacles, improving communication, addressing facility concerns, and improving program management. The contributions of this study extend to both academia and practice. Academically, this research augments the understanding of program management, student mobility, disaster response, and community engagement within the Indonesian educational landscape. Practically, this study provides a blueprint for educational institutions aiming to enhance the resilience and effectiveness of their programs in times of crisis. By elaborating on the implications and contributions of this research, we underscore its significant and far-reaching impact on educational practices, disaster management strategies, and community well-being.
