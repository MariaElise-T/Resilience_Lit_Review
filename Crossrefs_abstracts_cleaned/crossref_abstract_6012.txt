Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the factors influencing resilience in primary
brain tumor patients in Taiwan.
Methods: A total of 95 participants completed the cross-sectional survey. All of the participants had
undergone surgical, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy treatments for their brain tumors at least one month prior
to data collection. The instruments that were used in data collection included the Resilience Scale (RS), a
baseline characteristics datasheet, and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale.
Result: KPS score correlated significantly and positively with resilience (r = .49, p < .01). Moreover,
financial means (t = 3.31, p < .01), mode of tumor treatment (t = 2.10, p < .05), and tumor recurrence status
(t = -2.03, p < .05) were found to be significant predictors of resilience, accounting for 11% (R2
inc= .11, p<
0.01), 5% (R2
inc= .05, p< 0.05), and 12% (R2
inc= .12, p< 0.001) of the total variance, respectively.
Conclusion: Health professionals may use the findings of the present study to assess the relevant baseline
characteristics and physical abilities of their patients in order to better identify the presence of significant
protective or risk factors for resilience.
