 Resilience means doing well in the context of difficulty; it is both process and outcome, individual and collective, and it relates to inequities because it is about accessing resources. Resilience helps understand and improve health and wellbeing because it incorporates adversity and challenges. In this report, I argue resilience is also inherently geographical, and operates at interconnected scales. I highlight health geographers are well-placed to help understand and enhance resilience through critically-aware and contextualized approaches. Moreover, resilience offers a way to connect and further develop health geographical scholarship on both wellbeing and addressing health and other inequalities.
