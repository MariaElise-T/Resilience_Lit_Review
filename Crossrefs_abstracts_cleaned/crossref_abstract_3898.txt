This study examines the experiences faced by employed female cancer survivors when developing resilience. We used a phenomenological approach to understand these experiences and challenges. A total of ten participants with different types of cancer participated in this research, which was carried out using semi-structured interviews. Social media was used for triangulating the data collected. The meanings of resilience were monitored through the particpantsâ€™ social media accounts (namely, Facebook and Instagram) from the time of diagnosis until they returned to work. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Five themes emerged from the data collected: (a) resilience through painful experience, (b) resilience through acceptance, (c) cognitive resilience, (d) emotional/psychological resilience, and (e) behavioural resilience. From our participants, we gained insight into the meaning and conceptual definition of the cancer journey. The study is based on the authentic experiences of the participants. The findings are intended to create awareness among other employed women to aid the development of their resilience. The study results provide family counsellors and practitioners in the Malaysian context with guidelines to help women have positive lives in the future.
