Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the management of medicines at public health centres in Indonesia. Travel restrictions and shortages of certain medicines have put pharmacists in difficult situations and made ensuring the uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients more challenging.    
Objective: This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the management of medicines at Indonesian public health centres, and highlight the pharmacist’s resilience in community practice.    
Method: Four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in May 2021 involving 40 pharmacists at public health centres in Surabaya, Indonesia. Each group was asked about the professional practice of pharmacists during the 2020 and 2021 pandemic, including the obstacles and strategies for maintaining practice. The FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically.
Result: The participants agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic presented a significant challenge in the planning and use of medicines, and pushed pharmacist to change their procurement methods. Travel restrictions has resulted in a significant drop in patient visits. The situation have caused several drugs, particularly antibiotics, to go unused and expire, whilst there was an increased demand for COVID-19 medicines. Pharmacists were eventually able to cope with the problems by developing adaptability skills and by collaborating with others.
Conclusion: COVID-19 presented a series of challenges in the management of medicines at public health centres in Indonesia. Pharmacists have a strategic role in overcoming these challenges, this study highlights resilience as key for successful pharmacy practice.
