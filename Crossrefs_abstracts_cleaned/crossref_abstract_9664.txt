Background:Positive changes may occur in someone after experiencing a traumatic childhood. Previous research found that Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) could not be the only factor that becomes the cause for an individual’s Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG); thus, research that describes the role of a mediator in both variables is needed. Since studies investigating ACEs among Indonesia participants are still lacking, this would be considered as initial research on the relations of ACEs and PTG.Objective:This research was aimed to investigate how resilience becomes a mediator between children’s traumatic experiences of ACEs and PTG.Methods:This research used a quantitative correlational method to investigate the relation between the three examined variables: Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs), Resilience, and Post-traumatic Growth (PTG). A total of 349 participants were participated in this research, with the age range from 12 to 65 years old, predominantly female (N = 271;77,7%). Three research instruments were used in this study, such as the Adverse Childhood Experiences scale, Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, and Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).Results:The results showed a significant correlation between Adverse Childhood Experiences, Resilience, and Post-Traumatic Growth. A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis revealed a nonsignificant impact from ACEs to PTG. Resilience is proven to play the role of a mediator in the relation between ACEs and PTG, which was shown using the submitted model plot that revealed a higher total effect after resilience was placed as the intervening variable (standardized total coefficient = –.192). Details on mediating effects of each resilience factor were presented and explained further, along with the discussion on Indonesia's cultural background.Conclusion:This article revealed the connection between the ACE that the individual experienced in the past with resilience and PTG. Indonesian-related culture and characteristics were also explained.
