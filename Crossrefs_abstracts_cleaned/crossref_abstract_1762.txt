This research correlates the setting temperature of the Soil Cement (SC) with its resilient modulus, based on the maturity index of three mixtures made with different types of cements: general use, High Early Resistance, and Moderate Heat of Hydration. Each mix design has a compressive strength of 4,5 MPa at 7 days of age and durability measured with the 10% wetting and drying test. The method consisted of curing the samples of the three mix designs at three different temperatures -11, 30, and 40 â—¦C- and then monitoring the development of the temperature within the samples during the first thirty hours. At 28 days of age, the resistance modulus of the samples was measured with cyclic triaxial equipment. After analyzing the results, a linear equation was deduced which would facilitate quality control during the construction process. This prevents microcracking of the compacted layers, since their fracturing is not neccessary during the extraction of nuclei and field density tests.
