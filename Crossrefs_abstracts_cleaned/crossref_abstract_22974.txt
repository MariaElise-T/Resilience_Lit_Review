The understanding of the nature of communities has been deepened, and various criteria to define them have been used to this end, in particular geographic, professional, social-problem, environmental-problem, cultural-ethnic. It is determined that one of the types of communities are innovation communities - groups of people who direct their activities to obtain innovative results in a common environment, who are able to influence the solution of significant socio-economic and environmental problems of society. Based on systematization of the scientific and theoretical basis for identifying the phenomenon of innovation communities, their essential characteristics and advantages for the development of territorial communities are determined. Innovation communities are sources of progressive social transformations, as they are aimed at resilient and sustainable development of territories. The role and capabilities of innovation communities in revitalizing war-affected Ukrainian territories on the build back better principle are substantiated. The essence of this principle is revealed, which consists in the recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction of various societal spheres after disasters and calamities, not simply to the previous (in the case of Ukraine â€“ pre-war) state, but with the introduction of qualitatively new changes and improvements. The conformity of the implementation of this principle with the national interests of Ukraine is emphasized. The need to ensure the evolution of territorial communities and their population from a mostly passive observer and consumer to an active participant in the revitalization of settlements on the principles of resilience and sustainability has been determined. This requires the introduction of openness in public administration and partnership relations of local authorities with the local population, development of public awareness and activity, encouragement of entrepreneurship, social and environmental local initiatives, dissemination of successful innovative practices and a sustainable lifestyle.
