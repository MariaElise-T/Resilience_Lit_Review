 There is a requirement for developing long-term strategic asset management plans that are resilient to future needs while ensuring efficient and robust service delivery. Developing such a holistic long-term approach will require adoption of robust, flexible and multifunctional solutions that not only suit the needs of the present but also are safe, secure and resilient to whatever the future may hold. This establishes a case for support to develop systems and frameworks that can enable asset owners, government organisation and other decision makers to make informed decisions for adopting such solutions. This paper presents a methodology for developing such a decision support framework, which tests the resilience of transportation design solutions in light of changing socio-economic, technological, environmental and political conditions into the future and enables strategic decision makers to evaluate the resilience potential of the proposed asset management solutions in light of these future conditions.
