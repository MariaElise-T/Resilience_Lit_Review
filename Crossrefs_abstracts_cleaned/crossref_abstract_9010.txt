Abstract

Background
Discourse on the lives, health, and well-being of transgender and other gender minority (TGM) youth frequently revolves around narratives of risk and victimisation. While TGM youth undeniably face many challenges, such singular discourses belie a more complex picture of TGM youth lives and problematically position them as passive victims rather than as social subjects with agency.


Methods
The “LGBTI+ Landscape and Knowledge Gap Analysis” aimed to systematically map research evidence on sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth in Ireland and other European countries. A scoping review methodology was employed in which the systematic concept searches were linked to the five outcomes of Ireland's Better Outcomes, Better Futures national youth policy framework, which in turn are aligned with the fifteen objectives of the Irish LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy.


Results
One hundred and twenty-six pieces of evidence were included in the final sample for analysis, which were mapped to the fifteen objectives of the National Youth Strategy. Particular attention was given to the positive aspects and protective factors identified throughout the literature. The evidence showed that while TGM youth disproportionately experience stigma, discrimination and unequal health outcomes, there were sources of resilience at the micro-, meso-, and macro- levels that serve as protective factors against health inequalities.


Conclusions
Discourse that focuses exclusively on the ‘at-riskness' of trans and gender minority young people presents a one-dimensional perspective that fails to capture the reality and richness of their lives. Over-emphasising individual risk factors may obscure the structural and social factors that underpin the health inequalities experienced by TGM youth.
