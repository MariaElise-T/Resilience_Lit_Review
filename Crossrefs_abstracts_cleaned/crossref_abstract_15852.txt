 Measurements of thickness and compressional resilience were made on a variety of wash-wear-treated 80 × 80 print cloth samples. The method, utilizing an electronic compression tester, was more reliable and less time consuming than mechanical methods. Tension during treatment, mercerization, and add-on of wrinkle-resistant agents affected fabric thickness. An inverse relation was found between thickness at low pressure and the wash–wear panel rating of the samples. A high correlation existed between wrinkle recovery and compressional resilience, indicating the advantages of studies of compressional properties of wash–wear-treated cotton print cloths.
