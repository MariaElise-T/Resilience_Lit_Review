In this paper, a multi-parameter proximal scaled gradient algorithm with outer perturbations is presented in real Hilbert space. The strong convergence of the generated sequence is proved. The bounded perturbation resilience and the superiorized version of the original algorithm are also discussed. The validity and the comparison with the use or not of superiorization of the proposed algorithms were illustrated by solving the      l 1  âˆ’  l 2      problem.
