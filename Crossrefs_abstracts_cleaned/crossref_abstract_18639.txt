Background
Personal and psychological factors, such as depression, have a considerable influence on nonadherence to medications and self-care in those with heart failure. More evidence is needed about positive personal factors that motivate adherence to medications and self-care in those with heart failure.


Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there was a relationship between the personal resources of resilience, hope, health literacy, social support, and self-care activation and adherence to HF self-care and medications and whether race impacts adherence.


Methods
This study used a cross-sectional, correlational design. Stepwise regression was used to test whether resilience, hope, health literacy, self-care activation, and race significantly predicted medication adherence and self-care. A diverse sample was recruited for this study.


Results
Of the 174 participants, 51% were female, 51.7% were White, and the mean age was 62 years. After adjustment for differences in age and depressive symptoms, a predictive relationship remained between resilience, health literacy, and medication adherence. Hope, activation, and race were not selected in the final regression model. A high level of perceived social support was the only predictor of better HF self-care.


Conclusion
Persons with heart failure may have better medication adherence and overall self-care if sufficiently resilient, health literate, and supported regardless of their degree of hope or activation. Race and age may be important factors to consider. More research is needed to understand the connection between resilience and medication adherence.
