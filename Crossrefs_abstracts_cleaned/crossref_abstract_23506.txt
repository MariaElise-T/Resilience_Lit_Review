 Substance use disorders and feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) often manifest in early adolescence, are difficult to treat, and tend to co-occur. Despite their co-occurrence, little is known about their shared risk factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare standardized measures of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and protective factors among 90 adolescents and young adults seeking outpatient treatment for either opioid use disorder (OUD) or an FED. These were assessed using the Modified Adverse Childhood Experience Survey and Southern Kennebec Healthy Start Resilience Survey. Reported ACEs were high in both groups compared with the national average, and those with OUD were more likely to endorse ≥4 resilience factors. Meanwhile, the prevalence of emotional neglect, household mental illness, and peer victimization/isolation/rejection was similar between groups. Opioid use disorder patients were also less likely to endorse ≥9 resilience factors. Health providers should be mindful to assess for trauma and resiliency in both these populations.
