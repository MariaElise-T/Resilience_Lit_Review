AbstractObjectives:Understanding of prefrailty’s relationship with limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) moderated by psychological resilience is needed, as resilience might support ADLs’ maintenance and thus protect against frailty. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the influence of psychological resilience (using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale; CD-RISC) on the relation between ADLs and frailty status of older individuals (i.e. prefrail versus robust).Design:Cross-sectional design.Setting:UZ Brussels, Belgium.Participants:Robust (Fried 0/4;n = 214; Age = 82.3 ± 2.1yrs) and prefrail (Fried 1-2/4; n = 191; Age = 83.8 ±3.2yrs) community-dwelling older individuals were included.Measurements:Frailty scores were obtained from weight loss, exhaustion, gait speed, and grip strength. A total Disability Index (DI) expressed dependency for basic (b-), instrumental (i-), and advanced (a-)ADLs. Mediation was investigated by estimating direct and indirect effects of all levels of ADLs and CD-RISC total score on prefrailty/robustness using a stepwise multiple regression approach.Results:Prefrailty/robustness significantly correlated with a-ADL-DI (point-biserial correlation (rpb) = 0.098; p<0.05). Adjusted for age and gender, the a-ADL-DI (p<0.05) had a significant protective direct effect against prefrailty. No effects were found with the CD-RISC total score.Conclusions:Less limitation in a-ADLs is a directly correlated factor of prefrailty and might represent a higher likelihood of robustness.
