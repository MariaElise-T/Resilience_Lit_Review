Abstract

Background
This study explored the metacognitive awareness and emotional resilience levels of children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n=60) with typically developing children (n=30).


Methods
Measures included Metacognitive Awareness Inventory and Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents filled out by participants, the List of Adverse Life Events, Turgay DSM-IV-Based Disruptive Behavior Disorders Scale, and Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale—Parent Form filled out by parents.


Results
Metacognitive awareness and emotional resilience were found to be low in the children with ADHD. Emotional resilience increases as metacognitive awareness increases. Metacognitive awareness decreased in the presence of heightened ADHD, anxiety, and/or depression symptoms expressed by the parents' questionnaires (p < 0.001, r = −0.438; p < 0.001, r = −0.403; and p < 0.001, r = −0.421).


Conclusions
Findings identified that metacognitive skills and emotional resilience are affected in ADHD.
