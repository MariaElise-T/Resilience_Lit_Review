AbstractBenzoate plasticizers provide excellent foam quality, stain resistance, and UV light stability. They are used as primary plasticizers in resilient flooring applications but are limited in use because of viscosity. New benzoate‐based blends have been developed that result in reduced‐viscosity plastisols and lower VOC emissions than for existing benzoate products. A variety of European and North American formulations have been used to evaluate the processing and performance properties of these benzoate‐based blends and are highlighted in this paper.
