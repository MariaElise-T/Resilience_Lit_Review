 The resilient modulus (MR) of subgrade material is an important parameter in pavement design using the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) and has a significant influence on pavement performance. MR can be obtained indirectly from falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data using a back-calculation tool (i.e., AASHTOWare 2017) or from empirical correlations with soil index properties. MR can also be obtained directly using repeated load triaxial tests (AASHTO T 307-99, 2017). In this study, the field test program included FWD tests and soil sampling. These field tests were performed on six asphalt pavement sections in South Carolina, U.S., to estimate the MR of the subgrade soil. This study involved extensive laboratory characterization of subgrade soils collected from underneath the pavement sections. Laboratory characterization included index tests (sieve analysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity, moisture content, and standard Proctor density tests) on bulk samples and repeated load triaxial tests on thin-walled tube samples to obtain a direct measure of MR. Results show that the MR values found from the FWD data have similar trends to the laboratory-measured MR values. However, results from lab testing were 33%â€“75% lower than the back-calculated MR. Laboratory-measured MR, and back-calculated MR were used to determine a C-factor of 0.33, 0.25, and 0.29 for coarse-grained, fine-grained, and all types of soils, respectively. This parameter can be used to estimate resilient modulus for MEPDG Level 2 design inputs across South Carolina and similar geologic regions. The research studies will be facilitated by the local calibration and implementation of the MEPDG.
