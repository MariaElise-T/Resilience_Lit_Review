Resilience has become an interesting parameter to assess the seismic risk connected with functionality of structures. In this regard, losses due to earthquakes may be significantly reduced by applying isolation at the base of the structures. However, design of isolation needs to consider the effects of soil deformability and all the connected effects of Soil Structure Interaction (SSI). In particular, soil deformability may reduce significantly the benefit of base isolation and thus the computation of resilience needs to consider such conditions. This paper aims to consider the issue by considering several isolated configurations on different soil conditions and for each of them, the seismic resilience has been computed. Numerical simulations have been performed in order to calculate the resilience of the various configurations and then this parameter was chosen a reference for comparing the isolation models on different soil conditions.
