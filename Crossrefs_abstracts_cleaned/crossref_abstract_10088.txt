Purpose: The present study has adopted a case study approach to gain insight into the phenomenon of persistent success in business organisations from the perspective of leaders who have achieved it and proposes a new model of resilient leadership.
 
Design/Methodology/Approach:  Three case studies were conducted, providing an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to SME owners’ leadership orientation across diverse industries. The data analysis was conducted using a two-stage approach. First, by using thematic analysis, eight themes were identified. Second, expert reviews were consulted to obtain feedback on these eight themes, and subsequent modifications were made.
 
Findings:  The importance of leadership effectiveness extends beyond the operational functioning of a business, encompassing the crucial task of maintaining employee morale amidst grievances and volatile economic and social conditions. These leaders promptly demonstrated responsiveness and adaptability to the prevailing economic situation. A model of resilient leadership has been proposed, comprising six dimensions that include adaptability, emotional intelligence, vision, spiritual intelligence, a growth mindset, and an internal ecosystem.
 
Research implication:  The novelty of this newly proposed leadership model primarily lies in its application within the Malaysian context, as many of the previous leadership theories have been developed in a western context, and some of the elements might not be relevant to an eastern culture.
 
Practical implication: The newly proposed model could be embedded into the entreperenerial development in Malaysia and also be extended to other neighbouring countries that share similar cultures.
 
Originality/Value: Research on leadership is vast, with the majority of it conducted quantitatively. Thus, conducting a leadership study through qualitative analysis poses different insights and implications than the existing literature.
