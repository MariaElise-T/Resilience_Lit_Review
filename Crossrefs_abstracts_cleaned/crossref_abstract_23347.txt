AbstractWe report the impact of a Gentle Touch Stimulation (GTS) program. Forty‐three mothers provided daily 10‐min GTS with C‐tactile (CT) afferent optimal stroking touch, for 4 weeks to their 3–12 weeks old infants. CT‐afferents are cutaneous unmyelinated, low‐threshold mechanosensitive nerves hypothesized to underly the regulatory impact of affective touch. We compared physiological and behavioral responses during a no‐touch‐baseline (BL), static‐touch‐baseline (BL‐T), intervention/control (GTS/CTRL), Still Face (SF) and Reunion (RU) condition for GTS‐infants versus a control‐group (CTRL) at the start (T1) and end of (T2) of the program. We collected mother‐infant ECG, respiration, cortisol, video‐recordings, and diary‐reports. At T1, physiological arousal significantly increased during SF in both groups, that is, decreased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and R‐R interval (RRI). At T2, GTS‐infants showed significantly increased RSA, RRI, decreased respiration during GTS, buffering SF‐arousal and allowing complete recovery during RU; CTRL‐infants showed higher SF‐arousal and small recovery, under initial BL‐levels. Maternal cardio‐respiratory showed a metabolic investment during RU. Cortisol and behavioral analyses showed higher arousal in CTRL‐infants than GTS‐infants at T2. We suggest that the combination of phasic short‐term and tonic long‐term responses to CT‐optimal stroking touch, delivered in a structured daily manner, contribute to the building of infant stress regulation and resilience.
