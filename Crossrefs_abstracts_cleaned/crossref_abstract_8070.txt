 The article takes an historical perspective on Savannah’s port since 1733 to examine those unique port factors that contributed to the city’s resilience. I review resilience and path dependence literatures for seaport research, and I identify and review three critical junctures from Savannah’s history to explore the port city’s resilience. I then consider how the region once dominated by agricultural production began to move toward an industrial base, with World War II shipbuilding. I conclude by reflecting on how these episodes have helped to establish a trajectory of resilience for Savannah that continues today, suggesting that actor network theory and urban design aesthetics need to be additional criteria for historical port city resilience analysis.
