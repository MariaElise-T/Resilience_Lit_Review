Technological problems in machining of resilient wheelsets on wheel-turning lathes with friction drive
Article presents attempt of identification of technological problems in machining of resilient wheelsets on wheel- turning lathes with friction drive. Main part of presented research was modelling of machined wheel using finite elements method in conditions of load with forces measured during machining of railway wheelsets. Presented research is a part of works performed in order to enable regeneration of tyre profiles of resilient wheelsets using wheel-turning lathes with friction drive, which are commonly used nowadays for machining heavy railway wheelsets.
