The concept of community resilience has garnered a great deal of attention in the past decade and many theoretical constructs have been proposed to model resilience, including the community capitals framework. However, while the community capitals framework has been developed theoretically and subcomponents have been quantified, little research has attempted to address the community capitals framework as a whole and test how well the theorical constructs fit together. Using a structural equation model, we empirically investigate the community capitals framework and test how variables identified in the literature combine to predict community resilience. We find that, while many variables in the theoretical literature perform poorly, the overall framework provides a compelling avenue for addressing economic resilience.
