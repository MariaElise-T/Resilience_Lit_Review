Abstract. In the last decades, the UAV photogrammetry has been widely employed to obtain a complete and metric survey in different fields, especially when high resolution, speed of execution and safety are required. It is widely used in the construction sector and an interesting research field is their use to support the historical centres urban renewal projects, especially in post-earthquake reconstruction. In fact, the establishment of a construction site involves several intrinsic criticalities linked to the nature of the context, and especially in a post-earthquake scenario, additional problems arise beyond these critical elements. These conditions affect the preservation of historical centres, planned conservation, risk and resilience management. For this reason, it is necessary to develop innovative methodologies and strategy to plan interventions and to manage the construction sites in the historical centre after an earthquake.The use of UAV photogrammetry is a tool to support this activity in this field because it allows obtaining a complete and a high-resolution geometric survey of the areas to be reconstructed in a fast way and especially in total safety for the operators. For this reason, this study aims to illustrate a methodology that, starting from a series of preliminary surveys, supports the development of the program of reconstruction of a historic urban centre hit by an earthquake event. The aim of this research is to prevent problems, interferences and criticalities in order to increase the safety and rationality of the entire reconstruction process.
