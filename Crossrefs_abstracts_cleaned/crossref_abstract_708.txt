This paper is an overview of a pilot project aimed at improving the mental well-being of young people through outdoor activities and resiliency training for the whole family. The Thurston Family Project was part of the Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme in a local authority in the north-east of England. At the core of the project was the aim of teaching resiliency skills to the whole family in response to concerns that mental well-being issues in young people were frequently associated with adverse family circumstances. The project, therefore, aimed to address mental wellbeing needs through working with whole families rather than with young people in isolation. An outdoor education centre was chosen as a residential setting for delivering this training in order to provide an opportunity for families to apply resilience skills to challenging activities and to provide a supportive environment for them to explore new experiences and ideas. Evidence from the project evaluation indicated many of the young people reported more positive attitudes towards school and their home environment while their teachers noted reductions in anxiety, less disruptive behaviour at school and higher levels of pro-social behaviours. Parents reported making positive changes in family life and some showed greater engagement with opportunities in the community.
