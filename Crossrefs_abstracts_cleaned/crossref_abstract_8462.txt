Black and Latinx college students often have disparate access to social capital opportunities and experience more stress in comparison to their White counterparts. However, many students are resilient. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stress, resilience, and networking efficacy in a sample of predominantly Black and Latinx students (N = 114). The results of the linear regression indicated that resilience mediated the negative influences of perceived stress in relation to networking efficacy. Implications are discussed for how college career counselors can (a) help Black and Latinx students increase resiliency, (b) address stress, and (c) build social capital.
