Objectives  This study derived ways to improve the life satisfaction of young adults who experienced stigma as out-of-school youth by investigating the mediating effects of social stigma and ego-resiliency on the relationship between parental attachment and life satisfaction perceived by young adults who dropped out of school during adolescence. Methods  To this end, data from the panel survey for drop-out adolescents of the fifth year (2018) conducted by National Youth Policy Institute were used. A dual mediation analysis was performed on the data collected from 315 young adults aged between 24 to 29 years old using the PROCESS Macro program. Results  Analysis revealed that the mediating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between parental attachment and life satisfaction was not significant. However, the path in which parental attachment effects life satisfaction through social stigma and that in which it effects life satisfaction via social stigma and ego-resiliency in sequence were significant. Conclusions  These results suggest that improving the quality of interactions with parents is useful in improving an individual's internalized stigma. It indicates that work that promotes ego-resilience contributes to increase life satisfaction reduced by social stigma.
