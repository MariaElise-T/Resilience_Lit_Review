AbstractOrganisations included in social partnerships jointly address the gaps in their society and community. Community-based social partnerships are based on the principles of self-organisation, yet logistically, this can bring many challenges. This study therefore focuses on the logistical aspects of a community-based social partnership in Greece and the contribution of this partnership to community resilience. The role of community-based logistical activities in building community resilience has been studied. An in-depth qualitative study of a particular community-based social partnership was conducted, with interviews across all partner organisations and secondary data from publicly available documents. Logistical activities are performed mainly by the membership base of various non-governmental organisations in a manner of self-organised “collective action”. Interestingly, community resilience refers to a capacity for collective action; hence, organising logistical activities in this fashion ultimately contributes to community resilience.
