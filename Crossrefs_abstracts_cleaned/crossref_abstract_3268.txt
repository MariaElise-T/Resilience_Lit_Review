Supply chain disruptions can occur depending on internal and external factors and cause significant losses for all supply chain members. In order to cope with these disruptions, it is necessary to form resilient supply chain networks by pursuing holistic and proactive approaches. In the study, a resilient supply chain network design (SCND) problem is addressed under different disruption scenarios in a fuzzy environment by taking two of the most applied supply chain resilience strategies into account, namely the fortification of suppliers and using backup suppliers strategies. A two-stage integrated approach is proposed to solve the handled problem. The first stage includes the suppliers' evaluation process using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). A fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming (F-MLP) model is developed to design the supply chain network in the second stage. The application of this approach is carried out on a realistic hypothetical problem and the results obtained and applicability of the proposed approach are discussed.
