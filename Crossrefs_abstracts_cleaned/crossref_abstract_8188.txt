Abstract
When students learn to solve a problem in mathematics, they often face difficulties and challenges. The positive attitude of students in dealing and overcoming various problems that arise is known as mathematical resilience. Students with good mathematical resilience will be tough in solving various problems and will certainly get good learning outcomes. This study aims to analyze the variables that form the mathematical resilience of high school students. The subjects in this study were 110 high school students. The method used in this study is a quantitative descriptive method using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) techniques. Each respondent is given a mathematical resilience scale consisting of 25 statements which are the variables forming the mathematical resilience. The findings in this study indicate that seven main indicators that form mathematical resilience can be formulated in high school students. Each indicator is composed of several variables which are the constituent variables of the mathematical resilience ability. These indicators can be used as a foundation for further study of the mathematical resilience analysis of high school students.
