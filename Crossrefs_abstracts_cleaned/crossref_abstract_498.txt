Architecture is a platform that embraces sustainable design principles and fosters collaboration. Future architecture students and graduates require new skills to address changing environmental conditions and climate changes. Buildings play a crucial role in environmental conditions, urban development, and the well-being of users. Architects have a responsibility to design safe and resilient buildings for sustainable cities. This study discusses the importance of sustainability awareness in architectural education and shares the results of the graduate course "Sustainability and Materials in Architecture." It emphasizes the role of buildings in addressing natural and urban challenges. The course outcomes showed that sustainable development goals can be achieved by drawing insights from vernacular architecture. Through such curricula, young architects can enhance their ability to design buildings and settlements that withstand natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and landslides.
