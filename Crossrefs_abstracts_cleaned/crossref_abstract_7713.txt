SummarySustainable energy has captured special attention, particularly wind energy which makes wind farms as an attractive target for cyber threats specifically those impinging network cyber subsystems and control protocols. Given the significance of such issue, this article presents a novel anomaly‐based resilient pitch angle control methodology by incorporating fixed‐time high‐order sliding mode observer and adaptive sliding‐based controller. The main objective is to supply the required power through adjusting the pitch angle under cyber threat and exogenous disturbance. Residual has been evaluated using the output of the high‐order observer in order to detect the cyber‐attacks. Once the anomaly detector detects the cyber‐attack, its detrimental effects are compensated through the proposed adaptive resilient control framework. The finite‐time stability analysis of the closed‐loop system is performed through Lyapunov theory. Comprehensive studies are performed on a WindPact 1.5 MW wind turbine system, and validation results verify the effectiveness and resiliency of the proposed resilient control strategy in nullifying the detrimental network and physical effects of cyber‐attacks.
