AbstractWith the recent and continuous growth of large metropolis, the development, management and improvement of their urban multi-modal transport networks become a compelling need. Although the creation of a new transport mode often appears as a solution, it is usually impossible to construct at once a full networked public transport. Therefore, there is a need for efficient solutions aimed at prioritizing the order of construction of the multiple lines or modes that a transport operator might want to construct to increase its offer. For this purpose, we propose in this paper a simple and quick-to-compute methodology, called REINFORCE, to prioritize the order of construction of the lines of a newly designed transport mode by maximizing the transport network performances and enhancing the transport network resilience, as described by complex networks metrics. REINFORCE could also be helpful to support the rapid and quick response to disruptions by setting up or reinforcing an adapted emergency transport line (e.g., bus service) over a set of predefined itineraries.
