We explored the relationship between the positive academic emotions of pride, happiness, hopefulness, satisfaction, calmness, and being relaxed, and the factors that influence psychological resilience, including family support, problem-solving ability, self-resilience, sense of purpose,
 social-communication ability, attitude toward adversity, and ability to mobilize resources. Participants were 763 sons and daughters (339 boys and 424 girls, aged 14â€“16 years) of rural-to-urban migrant workers in Beijing, China. Results of regression analysis with positive academic emotions
 as the dependent variable showed that psychological resilience contributed 14.80% (self-resilience, 12.50%; problem-solving ability, 1.60%; ability to mobilize one's resources, 0.70%) to the total of 14.90% of the explained variance in positive academic emotions, and that the influence of
 sociodemographic variables (gender, age, school type, and family income level) on positive academic emotions was negligible. The results suggest that rural-to-urban migrant adolescents with higher levels of psychological resilience display more positive academic emotions.
