Understanding the interplay of attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, and resilience in ecopreneurship intention is crucial for comprehensive insights into sustainable entrepreneurial behavior. The objectives of this research are to investigate the influence of attitude toward ecopreneurship and subjective norms on ecopreneurship intention with the mediating effect of self-efficacy and moderating effect of entrepreneurial resilience. Drawing upon a quantitative methodology, researchers surveyed a sample size of 350 participants from Pakistani SMEs using a structured questionnaire. The researchers used structural equational model to test the hypothesis of the study. Researchersâ€™ findings reveal several significant outcomes. First, researchers establish that attitude toward ecopreneurship and subjective norms are prominent drivers of ecopreneurship intention among SME entrepreneurs in Pakistan. Second, self-efficacy emerges as a crucial mediator in this relationship, highlighting the pivotal role of individuals' belief in their capability to undertake ecopreneurial initiatives. Third, entrepreneurial resilience, as a moderator, adds a unique layer of complexity to the model by influencing the strength of the relationships between the variables. One notable contribution of this research lies in its exploration of the moderated mediation framework in the context of ecopreneurship, shedding light on the nuanced mechanisms at play. However, it is important to acknowledge the study's limitation, which is its sole focus on the SME sector in a specific geographic context. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to different sectors or regions may be constrained.
