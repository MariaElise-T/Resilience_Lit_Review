AbstractBackgroundInjectables that behave similarly to native tissue and preserve facial expressiveness represent a new frontier in aesthetic medicine. A range of fillers made of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) chains with low crosslinking have been specifically developed to complement facial dynamics.AimsThe efficacy and safety of one of these resilient HA fillers, and its noninferiority to an effective comparator available in the US, were tested in the treatment of dynamic wrinkles.MethodsA 15‐month, prospective, multicenter, controlled, randomized, double‐blind, within‐subject (split‐face) clinical trial was conducted on 140 subjects with moderate‐to‐severe nasolabial folds (NLF). Study endpoints included improvement on a proprietary Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, according to Blind Live Evaluators (BLE), subjects, and treating investigators (TI). Subject perception was evaluated with FACE‐Q and satisfaction scales.ResultsThe per‐protocol population included 88 subjects (92% women) of all Fitzpatrick phototypes, with a mean age of 57 years. WSRS improvement was significantly greater with the resilient HA than its comparator over 15 months, including at week 24 (primary endpoint), as rated by BLE and TI. Results demonstrated the noninferiority of the resilient HA filler to its comparator. Aesthetic improvement and subject satisfaction were durably high, with an overall trend toward higher scores for the resilient HA filler. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.ConclusionThe resilient HA filler made of long chains lightly crosslinked is at least equivalent to a well‐established comparator for the correction of NLF in subjects of diverse skin phototypes.
