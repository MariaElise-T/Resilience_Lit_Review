Domestic tourism emerged as a recovery strategy post-COVID-19. This study sought to identify domestic tourism research agendas in Africa post-COVID-19.  Following a document review methodology, data was collected via an electronic search of journal articles on the Web of Science and SCOPUS. A total of 42 articles were reviewed and analysed using thematic analysis. It was established that product development, marketing, resilience, sustainability and measurement of domestic tourism were the main research agendas. Domestic tourism emerged as a complement rather than a substitute for international tourism. The study sets the agenda for African domestic tourism resilience and sustainability research.
