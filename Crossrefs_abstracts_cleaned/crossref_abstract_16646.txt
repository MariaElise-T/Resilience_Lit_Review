Abstract
The objective of this research was to assess the economic potential of incorporating rabbit urine into the process of converting household waste into liquid organic fertilizer (LOF). This analysis was conducted within farmer groups situated in Jetis Hamlet, Jati Village, Jaten District, Karanganyar Regency, Central Java. The rationale for selecting farmer groups as the focal point of this analysis lay in the current challenges faced by farmers. These particular groups were directly affected by the ongoing global fertilizer crisis, characterized by a scarcity of subsidized products and escalating prices, thereby posing a threat to national food security. This research served as a pilot project with the potential for replication on a multispatial and national scale, fundamentally supporting national food security. The economic carrying capacity of the LOF produced was determined by comparing the results of laboratory tests on LOF nutrient content, both with and without using rabbit urine in the conversion of household waste. Based on the application of homemade LOF with rabbit urine supplements over 3000m2 of rice farming, the economic calculations showed that the total variable cost (VC) savings was 32.17%. Each planting season the potential for additional income for farmer households, with homemade LOF priced at IDR 30,000 per liter, totaling IDR 2,610,000. It was important to observe that market prices for LOF were around IDR 90,000 per liter. The homemade LOF had a substantial R/C ratio of 20,157. This research aimed to establish economic behavior patterns among suburban rice farmers that corroborated with natural principles. Simultaneously, it attempted to strengthen family economic resilience by creating independent economic resources serving as buffers for farming families. These resources were integral to supporting sustainable agricultural programs and reinforcing national food security.
