This study aimed to identify embedded drivers of organisational resilience through examination of stakeholders’ perceptions of the interaction between quality assurance and corporate governance in the South African aviation industry.  The study followed the methodological principles of qualitative content analysis to collect and analyse data from semi-structured interviews conducted among a convenience sample of 26 stakeholders to the South African aviation industry. A fragmented relationship between quality assurance and corporate governance in the South African aviation industry was identified. Dissonance between quality assurance and corporate governance reduces an organisation’s ability to remain resilient. Principles and practices associated with quality assurance and corporate governance stimulate underlying resilience.  The study provided a framework promoting organisational resilience derived from participants’ perceptions on quality assurance and corporate governance principles in the South African aviation industry. This contribution harmonised multiple disciplines of existing management systems into a practical and synergised unit to simultaneously overcome fragmented cooperation between quality assurance and corporate governance and stimulate resilience.  As the aviation industry provides a service to the public and serves as a platform for economic development of other industries, the insight associated with this study transcends the aviation industry itself.
