AbstractPosttraumatic stress responses are characterized by a heterogeneity in clinical appearance and etiology. This heterogeneity impacts the field's ability to characterize, predict, and remediate maladaptive responses to trauma. Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly utilized to overcome this foundational problem in characterization, prediction, and treatment selection across branches of medicine that have struggled with similar clinical realities of heterogeneity in etiology and outcome, such as oncology. In this article, we review and evaluate ML approaches and applications utilized in the areas of posttraumatic stress, stress pathology, and resilience research, and present didactic information and examples to aid researchers interested in the relevance of ML to their own research. The examined studies exemplify the high potential of ML approaches to build accurate predictive and diagnostic models of posttraumatic stress and stress pathology risk based on diverse sources of available information. The use of ML approaches to integrate high‚Äêdimensional data demonstrates substantial gains in risk prediction even when the sources of data are the same as those used in traditional predictive models. This area of research will greatly benefit from collaboration and data sharing among researchers of posttraumatic stress disorder, stress pathology, and resilience.
