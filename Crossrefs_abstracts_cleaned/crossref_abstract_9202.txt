The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of supply chain relationships on supply chain (SC) resilience through empirically exploring the effects of trust, communication, commitment and cooperation on SC resilience and its further impact on supply chain performance. We employed a cross-sectional survey through online mode for collecting perceptual responses from supply chain professionals. Using 155 completed responses, the study further analysed using SmartPLS to validate the proposed relationships. Findings suggest communication and cooperation as dominant enablers of SC resilience in the integrated model that explored the inter-relationships also among the proposed relational attributes. Also, SC resilience has positive performance implications. Alternate models were suggested to further explore the inter-play between communication, trust, commitment and cooperation and how the same influences the SC resilience. The study is the first to consider the inter-relationships among the relational attributes and how the same as a whole influences SC resilience.
