 Abstract. The present study examined the relationship between resilience and positive outcomes in friendships of young adults. SEM and bootstrapping analyses were performed to test whether positive emotions mediate the relationship between ego-resilience and enhanced friendship outcomes. Findings revealed indirect effects for friendship closeness, maintenance behaviors, and received social support. Our findings demonstrate the importance of positive emotions and its connection with trait resilience in the realm of friendships.
