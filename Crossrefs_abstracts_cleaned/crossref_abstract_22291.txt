AbstractThe sudden changes such as the drought of the 1980s and 1990s as well as the devastating floods of 2018 and 2019 have made water resource management in Khuzestan province a major challenge. Since one of the main ultimate goals of creating an exploitation system and its functions is to increase farmers' resilience to sudden changes, the purpose of this study is to measure the resilience of exploitation systems from agricultural water in irrigation and drainage networks of Khuzestan province. The obtained results are analyzed and compared.
