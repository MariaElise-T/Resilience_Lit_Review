In the globalized world, one significant challenge for organizations is minimizing risk by building resilient supply chains (SCs). This is important to achieve a competitive advantage in an unpredictable and ever-changing environment. However, the key enablers of such resilient and sustainable supply chain management are less explored in construction projects. Therefore, the present research aims to determine the causality among the crucial drivers of resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects. Based on the literature review, 12 enablers of RSSCM were shortlisted. Using the systems thinking (ST) approach, this article portrays the interrelation between the 12 shortlisted resilience enablers crucial for sustainability in construction projects. The causality and interrelationships among identified enablers in the developed causal loop diagram (CLD) show their dynamic interactions and impacts within the RSSCM system. Based on the results of this study, agility, information sharing, strategic risk planning, corporate social responsibility, and visibility are the key enablers for the RSSCM. The findings of this research will enable the construction managers to compare different SCs while understanding how supply chain characteristics increase or decrease the durability and ultimately affect the exposure to risk in the construction SCs.
