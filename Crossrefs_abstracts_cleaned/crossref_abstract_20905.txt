The purpose of this study was to find intervention measures for youth counselors to reduce burnout by examining the effect of trauma experience on counselor burnout through resilience and supervisor support. For this end, we used the case shock scale, resilience scale, supervisor support scale, and counselor exhaustion scale for 533 youth counselors. We obtained the following research results. First, the higher the trauma experience of youth counselors, the higher their burnout was. Second, the higher the resilience and supervisor support, the lower their burnout was significantly. The results of this study are consistent with previous studies, and the more trauma experiences of youth counselors, the less efficiently they may play the role of youth counselors, and resilience and supervisor support may reduce the burnout of youth counselors due to trauma experience.
