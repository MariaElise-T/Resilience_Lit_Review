This paper presents a layered error resilient scheme for Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) coding which incorporates the Multiple Description Coding (MDC) into the data partition. The major feature of this scheme is that the MDC is adopted in the process of packetizing the spatial orientation trees, so as to protect the important information bits according to different importance and channel state. The proposed scheme can allocate redundancy accurately and flexibly, by differentiating importance of bits through different bit planes. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good performance over packet erasure channels.
