Objectives  The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the career resilience scale of university students. Methods  To this end, first, the concept of career resilience and constituent factors were extracted through literature research, open surveys, and group interviews. Second, basic statistics, reliability, and exploratory factor analysis were conducted based on data from 540 university students in Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam with 70 preliminary questions that have been reviewed for expert content validity. Third, for validation, confirmatory factor analysis, convergence, and discriminant validity were conducted through data of 330 university students in Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam with 35 questions. Results  As a result of the study, first, exploratory factor analysis confirmed 7 constituent factors (self-awareness, self-confidence, achievement orientation, career preparation, creativity, flexibility, and relationship), and 35 questions. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was appropriate, and convergence validity and discriminant validity were also appropriate. As a result, the final measure of career resilience of university students was determined to be 7 constituent factors and 35 questions, and individual factors could include self-awareness, self-confidence, and achievement orientation, job factors could include career preparation, creativity, flexibility, and social factors. Conclusions  Based on the above results, the significance and limitations of the study, and suggestions for subsequent studies were presented.
