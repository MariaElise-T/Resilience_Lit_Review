AbstractThe present study evaluated the potential of a self‐resilient rural bio‐energy model using a case study from a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. A total biogas potential of 400 329 m3/year was estimated from area using agricultural residues and livestock wastes, thus capable of establishing biogas plants in a centralized (20 to 100 m3) or decentralized (2 to 20 m3) manner. For the three scenarios were considered in this study, i.e., (I) combined electricity and thermal energy generation, (II) for direct cooking, and (III) according to energy requirements, a maximum electricity generation and thermal energy potential were estimated to up to 800 658 and 1 200 988 kWh. A maximum amount of 162 646 kg.year–1 of firewood, 443 190 kg.year–1 of dung cake, 70 996 kg.year–1 of charcoal and 13 713 kg of liquified petroleum gas could be replaced using produced raw biogas, which is even higher if the biogas is upgraded. In the third scenario, a maximum surplus amount of 169 894 m3.year–1 of raw biogas and 221 969 m3.year–1 of upgraded biogas are available if all the available wastes are co‐digested. Vast cost opportunities and greenhouse gas emission reduction could result from replacing conventional cooking fuel and chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizer, contributing to the local circular economy. Eventually, the study proposes and discusses a self‐resilient bio‐energy model comprising energy demand fulfillment, sustainability, and a circular economy for rural India. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
