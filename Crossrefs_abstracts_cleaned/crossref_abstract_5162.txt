The special issue entitled ‘‘Resilience and Sustainability of Civil Infrastructures under Extreme Loads’’ updates the state of the art and perspectives focused on cutting-edge approaches to enhance structures’ resilience and sustainability under extreme loading events, including theoretical investigation, numerical simulation, and experimental study, keeping an eye on the seismic performance of civil structures. Notably, some innovative energy dissipative devices and resilient structural forms, which are encompassed in this special issue, would provide valuable references for the engineering application of resilient and sustainable civil infrastructures in the near future.
