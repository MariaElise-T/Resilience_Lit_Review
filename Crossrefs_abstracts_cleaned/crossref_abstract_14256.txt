Abstract
Bima Regency, located on Sumbawa Island, is an earthquake-prone region. The condition is the impact of its position on Sumbawa Island, which is flanked by two earthquake fault lines. Urban resilience is related to the region’s ability to maintain its form, function, and system in the event of a natural disaster. This paper discusses how local seismic culture in Bima can create urban resilience, so it becomes a sustainable disaster-responsive district. This study aims to identify the existence of local seismic culture to increase regional resilience in the context of disaster mitigation. A case study was done by collecting data through field observations and secondary data from the Statistics of Bima Regency. Local seismic culture already exists and is practiced by the local people of Bima to build their dwellings to be adaptive and responsive when an earthquake strikes. It becomes an internal strength in developing the region’s resilience. The local seismic culture can be a model for disaster mitigation preceding other regions in Indonesia prone to earthquakes.
