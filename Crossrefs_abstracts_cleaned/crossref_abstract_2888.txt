Organizational resilience and mindfulness are inextricably connected and have specific characteristics related to responding to challenging events. This mixed-method research study aimed to explore the relationship between mindful organizing and organizational resilience. A qualitative critical incident analysis was conducted with executives to explore insights into mindfulness and resilience at the organizational level. Using the analysis of a moment structures (AMOS) program, the structural equation modeling method was employed to assess the relationships between mindfulness, mindful organizing, and organizational resilience. A total of 639 usable cross-sectional questionnaires from diverse organizations in Thailand were used for data analysis. The findings of the current study reveal that mindful organizing has a positive influence on organizational resilience. This paper discusses the implications and limitations of these findings, along with suggestions for future research.
