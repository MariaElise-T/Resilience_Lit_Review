Resilience is a personal competence that facilitates coping with adversity and forms part of an individual’s psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, this construct has an important role in adolescent development. Youths with high levels of resilience usually show less risk of behavioral disorders, low academic performance or interpersonal conflicts. The objective of this study was to validate the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) in a Spanish population, and test whether this questionnaire is valid for different cultures and societies. The sample comprised 317 high school students aged 13 to 18 years old with an average age of 14.93, in the province of Almería (Spain). The Resilience Scale for Adolescents was administered for this. Based on exploratory factor analysis and the various previous studies undertaken on validation of this instrument, four models were proposed, of which the original READ model showed the best fit. Validation of this scale showed good internal consistency and high reliability on five factors: Family Cohesion, Personal Competence, Social Competence, Social Resources and Orientation toward Goals. It is considered a valid instrument for evaluating the various factors of resilience and can help determine the education factors contributing to the process of positive adaptation in adolescence.
