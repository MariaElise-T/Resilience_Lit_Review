 In 2012, the City of Toronto Environment Office undertook a resilience assessment project with the objective of understanding critical infrastructure interdependencies, to create a platform for stakeholder collaboration on issues related to extreme events, and to improve the cityâ€™s ability to survive and recover from extreme events efficiently. Herein this project is reviewed for its large contribution to the planning of urban resilience through the construction and analysis of dependencies of core city functions. This structure is generalised and formalised into a repeatable methodological form invoking the unique attributes of the vitae (of life) system of systems formalism to link urban resilience planning to the fundamentals of survival, vitality and conviviality as desirable outputs of integrated disaster management and of urban planning and asset management for sustainable urban communities.
