 Paul Clement (2011) presents a unique case of an adolescent with congenital limb deficiency. He integrates a number of approaches that encompass positive psychology, cognitive restructuring, social problem-solving skills, outcome assessment, and a quantitative evaluation of therapeutic change.  We examine this case using resilience as a theoretical framework with an emphasis on identity formation, self-esteem, coping strategies, and assessment. We provide some comments on the strengths of Clement's approach as well as offer suggestions of additional assessment procedures and interventions that may have been beneficial to Rafael's treatment.
