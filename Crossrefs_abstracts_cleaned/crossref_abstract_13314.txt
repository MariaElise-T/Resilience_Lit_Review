AbstractThe aim of this study was to examine the experiential perspectives of women becoming and experiencing homelessness. Situated in the qualitative interpretative tradition, data were collected using auto‐driven photo‐elicitation and in‐depth face‐to‐face interviews. Eleven Australian women used photographs that represented their experiences of being homeless to guide their interview discussion. The findings revealed that homelessness for women is a period often preceded by a series of adverse incidents in their lives, characterised by progressive resilience building in the face of trauma, finding hope and building strength to work towards exiting homelessness. After becoming homeless, five stages of resilience transition emerged: The trauma of homelessness, Finding hope and surviving, Finding help, Finding connection and Taking control. Women experiencing homelessness are resilient and capable of enacting competence and autonomy in seeking help to exit homelessness. Changes to service delivery are recommended to improve trauma‐informed, person‐centred housing and social services that are integrated and easy to navigate.
