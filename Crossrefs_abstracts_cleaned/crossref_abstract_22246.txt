This study introduces the Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) process, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the safety and resilience of urban infrastructures against natural and man-made disasters. The RIACT method stands out for its comprehensive analysis of potential disruptions to urban areas, encompassing their susceptibility to disasters, vulnerability factors, and recovery capabilities. This study’s primary focus is on Portugal’s 308 municipalities, assessing their preparedness and ability to recover from earthquake events. Methodologically, the study involved employing geographic information system (GIS) mapping to evaluate earthquake risks, combining data on regional risk areas, demographic and economic profiles, and resilience capacities. This approach provides a detailed understanding of each municipality’s strengths and areas in need of improvement, encouraging a collaborative framework for sharing and implementing best practices. The results reveal significant variations in earthquake resilience across different regions, highlighting the need for tailored resilience strategies. Conclusively, the RIACT method not only enhances the resilience of individual municipalities but also contributes to a broader national strategy for urban resilience, offering valuable insights for effective disaster risk management and recovery planning.
