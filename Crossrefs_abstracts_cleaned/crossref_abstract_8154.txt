Floods are the most common and costliest natural hazard in Australia. However, the Flood Resilience Assessments (FReAs) employed to manage them lack a focus on adaptive capacity and tend not to be incorporated into established flood risk frameworks. This leaves potential for Australian FReAs to make better use of a methodology which holistically incorporates more accurate flood resilience characterisations into flood risk frameworks. In this study, a FReA and mapping for the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment (HNC), a flood-prone region in Australia, were conducted. Nine flood resilience indicators were selected to derive the Flood Resilience Index (FReI). Results demonstrated that Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) on or near the floodplain, located near the eastern border of the HNC, present moderate to very high levels of resilience due to increased socio-economic development and urbanisation in the region. Ultimately, this novel FReI can contribute to knowledge bolstering flood resilience in the HNC, as well as assist in flood risk reduction. Additionally, the developed scalable and replicable methodology can be applied to other flood-prone regions of Australia.
