SummaryOwing to the deep integration of control, computation, and communication, cyber‐physical systems (CPSs) play an important role in wide real‐world applications. In this paper, we investigate the problem of resilient filter design of CPSs under malicious denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks launched by adversaries. Firstly, based on two standard assumptions concerning with the frequency and duration of DoS attacks, we state the H∞ filtering problem for the CPSs under DoS attacks. Then, sufficient conditions are developed to ensure that, when there are DoS attacks, the filtering error dynamics of the underlying CPSs is mean square exponential stable with a prescribed H∞ disturbance attenuation performance. Furthermore, a switched filter is designed for CPSs under DoS attacks. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed new design techniques.
