AbstractThis paper presents a framework for discussions of system resilience. The framework has five aspects: time periods, system types, events, resilience actions, and properties to preserve. The five time periods are well defined, but the other four aspects vary according to author, type of system, and purpose of the discussion, so what is presented is the variation that occurs among definitions.The framework is followed by a cataloging of principles for creating emergence, including a number of rubrics. Finally the paper discusses factors affecting resilience, including improving resilience, tradeoffs, and loss of resilience. An appendix details specific definitions and distinguishers from related properties.
