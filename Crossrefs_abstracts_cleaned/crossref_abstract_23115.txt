As health workers, nurses at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic tend to be very prone to suffer both physical and mental health problems due to workloads and other factors during the Covid-19 pandemic.This study aimed to analyze the impact of factors such as length and place of quarantine and stigma on the resilience among COVID-19 survivors nurses. This research uses a quantitative descriptive technique and a cross-sectional approach. The google form questionnaire method is used as an instrument in data collection and processed utilizing multi regression analysis. The research output showed that 58.7% of nurses who survived COVID-19 had moderate resilience, 25.4% had high resilience, and 15.9% had low resilience. The long quarantine period results lead to an average of 85.7%, 11.1% for the long quarantine period, and 3.2% for the short quarantine period, with an influence value of 7.1%. The result of stigmatization leads to moderate 71.4%, high 15.9%, and 12.7% low with an influence value of 94.7%. By getting in multiple regression analysis p-values of 0.003 < 0.05, the F test value (5,120) > F tab (3.09) and it is summarized that place, the length of quarantine and stigmatization simultaneously influence the resilience of COVID-19 survivor nurses. It influences the value of the determinant coefficient (R2) of 20.7%, and the rest is influenced by factors outside the study, such as gender, age and academic degree. These findings suggest that stigma and place of quarantine factors are important predictors that affect mental toughness and quality of life to increase immunity for nurses themselves.
