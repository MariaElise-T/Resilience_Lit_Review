 Objectives: The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) is a brief instrument measuring resilience in adults. The scale has shown sound psychometric properties in different populations and cultures. Our objectives were to cross-culturally adapt the CD-RISC 10 into Danish and to establish the psychometric properties of the Danish version in terms of internal consistency, construct validity and longitudinal validity. Methods: The CD-RISC 10 was translated using established guidelines. Employees ( N=272) at hospitals in the Central Denmark Region completed questionnaires at baseline and three months follow-up. Questionnaires included the translated Danish version of the CD-RISC 10 and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha and construct and longitudinal validity by correlating CD-RISC 10 and PSS-10 baseline scores and change scores from baseline to follow-up. Results: The Danish CD-RISC 10 provides acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87). Analysis of construct validity revealed a negative correlation with the PSS-10 at baseline ( r=−.63 [95%CI: −.70; −.55], p<.0001). Analysis of longitudinal validity similarly demonstrated a negative correlation on change scores from baseline to follow-up ( r=−.51 [95%CI: −.62; −.39], p<.0001). Conclusions: The scale has acceptable psychometric properties as an instrument for measuring resilience in a Danish-speaking population.
