AbstractAimFunctional traits mediate the interactions of species among themselves and with their environment, providing a link between diversity and ecosystem function. Crucially, the loss of biodiversity can jeopardize the functionality of ecosystems. Much focus is on predicting the impacts of current and future species loss; however, modern ecosystems have undergone biodiversity decline throughout the Late Quaternary, starting with the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions. Thus, the fossil record offers the opportunity to investigate the long‐term legacy of biodiversity erosion and how this is affecting modern ecosystems in a cumulative manner. We aimed to investigate changes in functional diversity and redundancy of a local mammal community at Hall’s Cave, a site with a continuous record from 21,000 years ago to the present. Additionally, we included several common introduced species in the modern community to test whether they restore some lost ecological function.LocationCentral Texas.Time periodLate Pleistocene to Present.Major taxa studiedMammals.MethodsWe used eight functional traits (mass, diet, arboreality, cursoriality, soil disturbance, group size, activity period and migration habit), which, collectively, describe the ecological role of a species and its influence on ecosystem processes, to construct a multidimensional functional space. The functional richness, range and distribution of the Hall’s Cave community and the degree of functional redundancy were characterized statistically over time.ResultsWe found that declines in functional diversity were greater than expected given the decrease in species richness, implying that lost taxa contributed higher than average distinct ecological function. Functional distances between the remaining species increased through time, leading to reduced functional redundancy in younger communities. However, recently introduced taxa increased functional diversity to levels similar to those in the Holocene and partly restored the functional space occupied by Late Pleistocene fauna.Main conclusionsOur local‐scale analysis demonstrates how prolonged biodiversity erosion not only leads to functionally depauperate communities, but, crucially, lowers ecological resilience to future disturbance.
