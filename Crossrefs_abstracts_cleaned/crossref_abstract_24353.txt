The study of the phenomenon of flooding in an urban environment requires the integration of the city in its physical context, in this case the entire impluvium. Thus, the consideration of all the hydrological, morphometric and physical characteristics (topography, lithology, land cover...). In order to put in place appropriate measures to improve urban resilience and protect the population and their property in the capital of Algeria (City of Algiers), a hydrological modeling must be carried out upstream to evaluate the hydrological response of the watershed. This modeling was done using the auxiliary tool HEC-GEO HMS, an extension that works in a GIS environment (ArcGIS).
