The aim of this study was to investigate whether two aspects of resilience—acquired and innate resilience—were related to self‐rated health status in registered dental hygienists and students. In May through July 2017, 405 students at three dental hygiene programs and 85 registered dental hygienists, all in Fukuoka prefecture in Japan, were invited to participate in a survey including three scales: the Bidimensional Resilience Scale (BRS) to assess innate and acquired resilience, the Stress Response Scale‐18 (SRS‐18) to assess daily stress responses, and the Sense of Coherence 13‐item scale (SOC‐13) to assess the sense of coherence. Information about self‐rated health status and number of years of clinical experience was also collected. Respondents were 398 students (98.2% response rate) and all 85 dental hygienists (100% response rate). The cohort with a self‐rated “healthy” status scored higher on total scale and each domain of the BRS, SRS‐18, and SOC‐13 scales than the cohort with other self‐rated health statuses. These three scales and self‐rated health status were significantly correlated with each other. When innate resilience increased by one point, average self‐rated health was 1.14‐fold higher. In contrast, when the depression/anxiety domain score of SRS‐18 increased by one point, self‐rated health was 0.84‐fold lower. The number of years of clinical experience was also negatively correlated with self‐rated health. For these participants, innate resilience was a significant predictor of better self‐rated health. To maintain the health of dental hygienists and students, it is important to understand their innate resilience as well as stress responses related to depression/anxiety factors and length of clinical experience.
