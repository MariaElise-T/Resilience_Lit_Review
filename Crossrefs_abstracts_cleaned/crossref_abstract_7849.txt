AbstractAimsThe occurrence of AIDS in 1980s posed difficult problems for haemophilia clinicians worldwide. The impact of these events is substantial, and the events continue to be subject to judicial proceedings and publications. The stance of haemophilia physicians, particularly their professional resilience, is of importance and remains unexamined.MethodsDeploying oral histories informed by literature review of scientific publications and past inquiry reports, this qualitative study addresses how physicians continued to work in haemophilia during those years and attributes that contributed to their resilience.Results and conclusionsExperience and role in laboratory aspects were of value in handling and communicating uncertainty. Collegiality, peer support and scholarship were important in sustaining their roles, in clinical decision‐making and re‐instating confidence in the therapeutic relationship during the toughest years of their practice.
