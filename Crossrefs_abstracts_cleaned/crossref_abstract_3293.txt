The present cross-sectional correlational study was conducted with an aim to investigate the relationship between Psychological well-being and Resilience among Covid Recovered Patients. The data was collected through convenient sampling and a sample of 142 respondents from Gujarat state in the age range of 18-60 years participated by filling up Socio- demographic measure, the Ryff’s Psychological Well-being, and The Resilience Scale questionnaire. The Questionnaires were converted into Gujarati language and then validated by the experts. Spearman’s rho correlation and independent sample t-test were performed to determine the relationship between psychological well-being and Resilience among the research participants. Data was analysed statistically at the level of p < 0.05. The results from the study showed that there was a statistically significant Positive relationship between Psychological well-being and Resilience. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to address and encourage researchers and clinicians to give as much attention to the development and maintenance of psychological well-being in the face of serious illness as they do to the aetiology and treatment of psychiatric symptoms.
