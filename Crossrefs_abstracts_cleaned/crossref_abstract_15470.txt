Resilience, the ability to spring back from adversity and successfully adapt to it, is becoming an increasingly popular focus in research on the intervention and prevention of mental breakdown. This article aims to assess the resilience of adults exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake 1 year after the occurrence of the earthquake, to explore the relationship between demographic factors (such as gender, age, ethnic group, education level, and monthly income) and resilience via the Resilience Scale for Adults, and to identify the significant predictors of resilience. Using variance analysis and multiple regression analysis of all demographic factors above we further elaborate the findings.
