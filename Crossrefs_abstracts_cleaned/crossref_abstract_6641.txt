ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Resilience is the ability of patients to adapt effectively when given a diagnosis of an illness. While awaiting brain tumor surgery, patients often experience uncertainty from brain tumorâ€“related symptoms resulting in inducing depressive symptoms, having physical disability, and reducing quality of life. Resilience studies have been widely conducted in the postoperative phase with a limited knowledge on the preoperative phase. This study aimed to identify predictors of resilience while awaiting brain tumor surgery. METHODS: This cross-sectional predictive study includes 100 participants 18 years and older, with diagnosis of brain tumors, and waiting for brain tumor surgery at the outpatient department of 1 tertiary hospital in Bangkok between August 2022 and February 2023. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the predictors of resilience. RESULTS: Most of the sample (77%) were female with a mean age of 52.71 (13.17) years. The most common type of brain tumor was meningioma (38%). The median waiting time since brain tumor diagnosis until the date of preadmission for operation was 18 (3-1464) days. Symptom severity, social support, and treatment plan were able to explain 37.3% of the variance of resilience in patients awaiting brain tumor surgery (F = 19.077, P < .01, R
2 = 0.373, adjusted R
2 = 0.354). CONCLUSION: Resilience is an important skill for patients with brain tumor to manage uncertainty events that occur in their lives. The preoperation phase needs to assess both physical and mental tumor-related symptoms, and include caregivers as part of the care, to promote resilience skill for patients awaiting brain tumor surgery.
