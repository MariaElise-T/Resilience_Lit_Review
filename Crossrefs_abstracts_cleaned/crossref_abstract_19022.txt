This paper addresses the integrated planning problem of a power network and the charging infrastructure of electric vehicles (EVs) for enhancing power system resilience under various extreme weather scenarios. The planning methodology determines the optimal joint expansion decisions while modeling the benchmark system operation under the n âˆ’ k resilience criterion. The proposed coordinated planning framework is a robust two-stage/tri-level mixed-integer optimization model. The proposed robust joint planning model includes the construction plan in the first level, identifying the worst-case scenario in the second level, and optimizing the operation cost and load shedding in the final level. To solve this model, a duality-based column and constraint generation (D-CCG) algorithm is developed. Using case studies, both the robust sole transmission planning and joint planning models are demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus power systems. Numerical simulations of the benchmark systems validate the effectiveness of the developed framework and the efficiency of the proposed solution approach. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed robust integrated planning over the sole transmission planning model.
