The resilience of building structures—as plain technical/physical/engineering systems or complex sociotechnical systems exposed to perturbations and change—has become increasingly important as natural disasters are on the rise and the world is changing rapidly. Existing resilience frameworks are focused mainly on the responses of building systems to perturbation events and their functional recovery, while change appears to be left out. This study applies the resilience system interpretation framework, which defines resilience in a cross-disciplinary environment as adaptation and adaptive systems, to analyze actual and conceptual building structure systems. The system framework, using modern control systems theory, defines resilience as the ability of the system state and form to return to their initial or other suitable states or forms through passive and active feedback mechanisms. A sample SMRF office building structure system is utilized to simulate the system state and form return abilities that are demonstrated by the system functional recovery time and functional recovery curve shape, respectively. This novel understanding of resilience accommodates a holistic and systematic integration of both perturbation and change in the portfolios of various building structures. The framework also provides a practical roadmap for resilience design and building of structures that effectively respond to perturbation while dynamically adapting to change in order to avoid obsolescence, as well as to increase the building’s useful life.
