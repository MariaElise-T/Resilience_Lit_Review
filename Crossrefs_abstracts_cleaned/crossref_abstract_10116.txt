 Resilience in the organizational context is a fruitful concept for understanding employeesâ€™ success in dealing with workplace adversity. Through a diary study, we have examined the interaction effects of time pressure and different work-related capabilities of resilience (i.e. emotional coping, comprehensive planning, positive reframing, and focused action) on emotional exhaustion and work engagement of employees. A sample of 79 employees (54.4% male) responded to two daily surveys (after work and before bedtime) for a period of five consecutive workdays. Results show that time pressure had a positive association with emotional exhaustion. Further, time pressure showed a positive association with work engagement, but only when considering additional personal resources. Positive reframing was positively related to work engagement on the day-level but did not moderate the link between time pressure and the outcomes. Emotional coping as well as focused action decreased sensitivity to time pressure. The results underpin the impact of different work-related capabilities of resilience and provide novel theoretical and practical implications.
