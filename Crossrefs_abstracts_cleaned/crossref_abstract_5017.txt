The COVID-19 pandemic starkly revealed the vulnerability of global food systems, prompting a pressing call for sustainable and resilient practices. This conceptual paper forms an integral part of a comprehensive study aimed at investigating the pivotal role of technological and sustainable solutions in surmounting pandemic-induced challenges and attaining vital food security objectives. Specifically, this conceptual paper delves into the possibilities inherent in cloud-based management, robotics, and circular economy principles, focusing on their potential to bolster food security. To this end, the paper proposes the implementation of an ’IoT based Farm robot’ to enhance aquaculture resilience in Yogyakarta, Indonesia – an apt locale renowned for its vibrant community and agricultural traditions. Leveraging cloud technology, the paper explores the remote management and monitoring of fishponds, thereby optimizing resource utilization and elevating overall productivity. Through the integration of robotics, the automation and precision introduced to fish farming processes serve to lessen reliance on manual labor. Furthermore, the incorporation of circular economy principles underpins sustainable practices, minimizing waste and maximizing the efficiency of resources. By harnessing the synergy of cloud-based management, robotics, and circular economy principles, this conceptual paper introduces a solution that empowers local communities to both navigate the current pandemic crisis and foster enduring aquaculture resilience. The discourse presented within this paper holds valuable implications for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners invested in aquaculture and food security. Moreover, it contributes to the wider conversation concerning sustainable food systems, offering a pathway to cultivating a more secure and resilient future for aquaculture in Yogyakarta and beyond, even amidst pandemics and other disruptive occurrences.
