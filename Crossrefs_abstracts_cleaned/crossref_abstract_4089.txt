 Can the boss take the heat? Is he or she tough enough for the job? Can they take it, endure the pressure, tolerate or stand up to it? Although we know that resilient leaders are essential for a healthy and efficient workforce, the resilience of leaders itself is still largely unexplored. Our study aims to identify distinctive resilience factors in leadership and help close this research gap. We interviewed 27 leaders from various industrial sectors, German regions and leadership positions. In a qualitative content analysis, we identified 77 individual, situational and behavioural factors that seem to impact on the resilience of leaders. We divided these factors into meaningful categories and integrated them into a framework appropriate for leadership. This framework shows that in addition to individual traits and abilities, situational factors (private and work environment) and behavioural factors (personal and interpersonal behaviour) are highly important and that leaders’ resilience results from an interaction of these factors. As most of the identified factors can be directly influenced by the leader or the organization, our study provides important insights into the effective development and nurturing of leaders’ resilience. Furthermore, the findings can be a helpful starting point for future empirical studies.
