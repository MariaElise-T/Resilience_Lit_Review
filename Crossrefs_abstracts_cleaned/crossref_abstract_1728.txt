This report uses a critique of the ontology of research on climate change and armed conflict to advance a positive and performative account of the ways in which peace could be sustained and expanded through a changing climate. Focussing on research into the relationships between climate change and armed conflict and peace, it argues that recent debates about the effect of climate change on conflagrations stem from deeper assumptions about the way the world is and can be known. The report then builds an alternative framing of peace as a phenomenon that is resilient to climate change by layering knowledge about the conditions under which peace prevails through environmental change with that on environmental peace-building and on the intersections between resilience and security.
