 The promotion of successful ageing (SA) has become a strategy. But there has been little examination of the dimensions that are associated with SA from an integrative perspective that takes into account potential particularities among indigenous older adults. This study explores the predictors of SA for a sample of 800 older Chilean adults. The results show that demographic, health and psychosocial variables are associated with SA, with resilience being of particular note. The findings of this study underline the importance of assessing SA, using multidimensional approaches and emphasising heterogeneity and the particularities of indigenous cultural contexts.
