The past decades have seen that the tin industry has to face a challenging scenario for its operation especially in decreasing ore grades, deeper deposits, and harder rock mass (SÃ¡nchez & Hartlieb, 2020). Notwithstanding to that, the mining activity that decrease the environmental stability, causes pollution, reduced water quality and change of biodiversity (Nurtjahya, Franklin, & Agustina, 2017) has urged the industry to be more environmentally friendly in their operation. In addition, the global economic crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic has added the tougher situation for tin industries. Like it or not, the tin industry needs to combat the challenges in order to remain in the business. In other word, we need a resilient tin industry that can recover from the adverse experience and move forward not only for success but also to contribute for a better nation. A possible solution to become a resilient industry is by adoption of digital technology to increase the operation efficiency, adoption of green technology to reduce the negative environmental impact, managing adequate financial resources to overcome the economic crisis and encouraging product innovation to enhance customer satisfaction.
