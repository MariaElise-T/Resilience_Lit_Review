Objective: Based on the environment-individual interaction model and the "evaluation-coping" theory, the relationship between Resilience, Coping Style, Core Self-evaluation and psychological health of disadvantaged children was explored to provide some theoretical support for psychological health intervention research. Methods: Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescent (RSCA), core self-evaluation Scale (CSES), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to conduct a questionnaire survey among 618 middle school students in South Xinjiang. Results: First, GHQ-12 scores were negatively correlated with RSCA, CSES, and SCSQ scores (r=-0.57/r=-0.56/r=-0.49, P <0.001), and positively correlated with the level of psychological health; second, coping styles is a mediator between resilience and psychological health (mediator effect value is -0.04); third, core self-evaluation is a mediator between coping styles and psychological health, there is "resilience — coping styles — core self-evaluation — psychological health" path. Conclusion: Resilience can directly predict the psychological health of disadvantaged children, and indirectly predict psychological health level through chain mediation of coping styles — core self-evaluation.
