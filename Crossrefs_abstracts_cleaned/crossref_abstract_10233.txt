AbstractThis article is aimed at describing and validating a new short version of the National Resilience Scale (NR‐13). The available 25‐item National Resilience Scale has been employed and validated by several studies. However, the present data show that it can be substantially shortened without losing either its reliability or its validity. The new short version of the scale has been examined by the responses of an Israeli sample of adults (N = 1022). Results indicate, as expected, that national resilience promoting factors (community resilience and sense of coherence) significantly and positively predict NR‐13. A resilience‐suppressing factor (sense of danger) negatively and significantly predicts NR‐13. These predictions have been replicated in an additional sample of Israeli higher education students (N = 423). These results support the reliability and the validity of the short National Resilience Scale (NR‐13).
