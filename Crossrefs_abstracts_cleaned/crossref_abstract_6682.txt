AbstractAmidst the increased exposure of vulnerable communities to disaster risks in recent years, the optimal use of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for effective risk reduction, enhanced social resilience, and a more sustainable human environment is essential. The limited flexibility of SIA methodological guidance is a potential obstacle to optimal practice, particularly in developing countries with complex social contexts, such as South Africa. In this article, the potential integration of SIA with aspects of Disaster Risk Assessment (DRA) for improved practice is explored by evaluating commonalities and differences in South African SIA and DRA methodological guidelines in comparison with international good practice guidelines. While South African SIA guidance is in line with international good practice, definite shortcomings were observed, such as the absence of risk assessment guidance. The findings suggest that the incorporation of DRA has the potential to strengthen risk assessment in SIA practice through an integrated approach to social risk baseline studies. SIA and DRA practice communities will benefit from this integrated approach, and thereby contribute to improved social resilience, all of which should contribute to sustainable development outcomes, especially in hazard influenced contexts.
