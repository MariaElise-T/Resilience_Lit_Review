Significance
Fisheries management must avoid adverse impacts on the ecosystem. Doing so can be challenging in highly complex systems, particularly if the target species serves an important ecosystem function. Caribbean coral reefs provide a classic example in which herbivorous parrotfish are both an important fishery and key driver of ecosystem resilience. We developed and tested a multispecies fisheries model of parrotfish and linked it to a coral reef ecosystem experiencing climate change. We found that corals can remain resilient if less than 10% of the fishable parrotfish biomass is harvested and a minimum size of 30 cm is implemented. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to identify harvest levels that have little adverse effect on corals.
