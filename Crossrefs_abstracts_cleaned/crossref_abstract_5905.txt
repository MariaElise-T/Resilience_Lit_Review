The paper considers the problems of adequate interpretation of the term «resilience» in relation to the term «sustainable development» and offers a consistent holistic system of concepts based on the term «shock-resistance» (shoko-ustoychivost’), which allows discussing the problems of sustainable development and resilience in Russian (without mixing these terms) and provides an adequate translation of the relevant English terms. Based on the study of theoretical and methodological approaches and existing attempts to measure the resilience of cities and regions, the directions for creating a methodology for measuring resilience are proposed. The article describes the available Russian examples of measuring the resilience of regions a posteriori (based on the analysis of the behavior of indicators of socio-economic development during and after economic and budgetary crises) and a priori (based on the characteristics of the industry structure or risk resistance of the economic, social and governance subsystems of the region). A paradox is noted: in Russia, the facts of subsidization of the region and the backward structure of the economy are factors that increase the resilience. The ways of embedding mechanisms for increasing resilience in the system of strategic management of urban and regional development are shown. It is proposed to introduce resilience audit into management practice and create a regional (municipal) risk-management system and the position of a risk manager.
