 Patient-oriented health research approaches are growing in popularity; however, there is a lack of literature describing how patient-oriented research is being utilized to enhance mental health programming for students. The current study reports on a participant-oriented approach to development and evaluation of an innovative, holistic, multi-disciplinary program designed to empower post-secondary students to actively maintain their health and well-being and support academic success. Results demonstrated significant increase in self-reported resilience and anxiety symptoms, but no change in depression symptoms. Prevention programs co-designed with intended users show promise as an effective approach to supporting students with sub-clinical mental health challenges.
