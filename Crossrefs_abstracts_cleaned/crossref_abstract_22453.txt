Abstract
School has a significant role in building community resilience since school has the responsibility to deliver knowledge and science in a one hand, and has the capacity to implement disaster risk reduction education in the other hand. Having more than eighty schools located in volcanic disaster prone areas, Merapi volcano is one of the most densely populated volcanoes in the world. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of schools in implementing disaster risk reduction education through a program entitled Sister School and to 1nalyse teachers’ and pupils’ knowledge and experience on volcanic disaster and risk reduction awareness program. In addition, this research tries to 1nalyse their acceptance towards this disaster resilience program. This research was conducted in two schools located in a volcanic prone area, one as affected school and one as supporting school. The results showed that schools located in the highest volcanic prone area participate in the Sister School program. Most of teachers and pupils of the affected school and supporting school have good knowledge on volcanic disaster since most of them experienced the 2010 Merapi volcanic eruption and participated different volcanic risk reduction awareness programs. Teachers and pupils have positive acceptance towards sister school program.
