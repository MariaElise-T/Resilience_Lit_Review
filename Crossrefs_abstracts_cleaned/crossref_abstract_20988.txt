AbstractThis paper investigates the resilient control, analysis, recovery, and operation of mobile robot networks in time‐varying formation tracking under deception attacks on global positioning. Local and global tracking control algorithms are presented to ensure redundancy of the mobile robot network and to retain the desired functionality for better resilience. Lyapunov stability analysis is utilized to show the boundedness of the formation tracking error and the stability of the network under various attack modes. A performance index is designed to compare the efficiency of the proposed formation tracking algorithms in situations with or without positioning attacks. Subsequently, a communication‐free decentralized cooperative localization approach based on extended information filters is presented for positioning estimate recovery where the identification of positioning attacks is based on Kullback–Leibler divergence. A gain‐tuning resilient operation is proposed to strategically synthesize formation control and cooperative localization for accurate and rapid system recovery from positioning attacks. The proposed methods are tested using both numerical simulation and experimental validation with a team of quadrotors.
