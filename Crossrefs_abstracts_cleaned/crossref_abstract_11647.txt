A multiple-case exploratory study is used to describe intrapersonal,
behavioral, and environmental assets that may build bridges for
Deaf adults between the Deaf and hearing worlds. A study of three
exemplary former community college students provides new information
about internal resources that may empower Deaf individuals to achieve
work and social success in interaction with environmental support,
despite the vulnerabilities associated with their deafness. This
study identifies 15 assets that may support resilience in Deaf adults,
including authenticity and comfort with solitude. The
authors hypothesize that social authenticity and comfort with solitude
may be resilience-fostering intrapersonal assets of unique importance
in the Deaf community. From the positive psychology perspective of
recognizing and building on human strengths, the authors suggest that
support of mutual asset-building with learning partners in the classroom
is one way professors might promote optimal student achievement and life
success for all students.
