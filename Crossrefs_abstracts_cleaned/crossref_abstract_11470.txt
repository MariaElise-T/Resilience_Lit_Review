PurposeThis study explored the role of inter-organizational systems (IOS) appropriation in the form of five key IOS usage-based capabilities, namely, IOS use for communication, intelligence, integration, collaboration and coordination in the development of tourism SC agility and resilience. Furthermore, the inter-relationship among these IOS usage-based capabilities were explored.Design/methodology/approachThe study collected perceptual measures from hotel managers and tour managers having sufficient experience in the tourism sector. With 209 completed responses, the data were analyzed using partial least squares.FindingsThe study found IOS use of communication and intelligence as prominent enablers of IOS use for integration, collaboration and coordination. Furthermore, IOS use for integration, collaboration and coordination was found to have a prominent influence in the development of tourism SC agility and resilience. However, the influence of IOS use for communication on collaboration was not supported. Also, the impact of IOS use for collaboration in tourism resilience development was not supported.Originality/valueThe study is the foremost to explore the role of IOS appropriation in the development of dynamic capabilities like agility and resilience in tourism. Furthermore, the study also contributed to extant literature on IOS appropriation through suggesting two additional factors, namely, IOS use for collaboration and coordination to the existing IOS usage-based capabilities.
