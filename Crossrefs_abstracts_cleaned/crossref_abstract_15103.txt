 Objective: to associate and correlate musculoskeletal pain, stress and resilience of nurses in the maintenance of Hospital Accreditation Certification.  Method: longitudinal study in two moments, before and after the Accreditation maintenance visit, March and June 2019, with 53 nurses from a hospital institution. The data collected was: sociodemographic, clinical and occupational variables, stress, osteomuscular pain and resilience. Descriptive variables, Chi-square test, t test, Fisher’s exact test, Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were used.  Results: most of the study participants had average stress levels before and after the evaluation. Most of those who reported pain were at medium stress levels at both times. The resilience capacity increased after the evaluation, which demonstrates that the experienced stressors were adequately addressed. There was no significant association between the cortisol levels and the perceived stress.  Conclusion: occupational stress and musculoskeletal pain were experienced by nurses during the Accreditation processes. It was evident that individuality permeated the perception of stress and resilience allowed to overcome the tensions experienced. The study identified that there is a need for planning and implementation of actions to collaborate with the nurses in the best confrontation, aiming to promote resilience.
