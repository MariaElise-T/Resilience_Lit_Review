It is very important for the organization to keep its intellectual resources updated and ready for uncertain situations. This study aimed to explore the direct association between HR practices i.e. (job design, information flow, employee development, and employee benefits) and work happiness, and mediating role of employee resilience as well. The data were collected from 315 employees through self-administered questionnaires working in public and private sector banks of Lahore, Pakistan. The structural equation modeling analysis was employed for hypotheses testing. The result showed that HR Practices i.e. (job design, information flow, employee development, and employees benefits) were positively directly related to work happiness.
