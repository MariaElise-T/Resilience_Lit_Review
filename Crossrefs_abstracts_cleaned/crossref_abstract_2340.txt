Background:  Many studies have documented that adopted children are at higher risk for behavior problems, but less is known about the correlates of their problem behavior.Method:  The correlates of parent‐reported and teacher‐reported problem behavior in 7‐year‐old internationally adopted children (N = 176) were investigated by examining these children's ego resiliency, ego control, and sociometric status, and exploring possible risks factors in the home and racial influences.Results:  Using the 25th percentiles lowest and highest scores on ego resiliency and ego control as cut‐off criteria, we found that: (1) resilient children were almost free of behavior problems; (2) overcontrolling children showed predominantly internalizing behavior problems (33% at school, and 28% at home); (3) undercontrolling children showed high rates of externalizing behavior problems (50% at school, and 34% at home), and an elevated rate of comorbidity (21% at school, and 21% at home). Adopted children identified by peer report as controversial or rejected had significantly higher externalizing problem scores than popular, average or neglected adopted children. The adopted children did not experience much (racial) discrimination. Nevertheless, children who wished to be white (46%) presented more mother‐reported behavior problems.Conclusions:  Our findings replicate R.W. Robins et al.'s (1996) work on three types of personality functioning: resilients, overcontrollers and undercontrollers (identified by J. Block, 1971), extending the model from adolescent boys to school‐aged boys and girls, adopted from Asia and South America. The wish to identify with white parents and white peers may constitute a potential risk factor for internationally adopted children in middle childhood.
