The use of hybrid environmental policy instruments is an open research topic, particularly in the case of water resources protection. We analyzed the influence of hybrids between command-and-control regulation (CAC) and environmental taxes where the body of water’s capacity for resilience and drinking water supply are critically affected by pollution accumulation over time. We used a general equilibrium model in which it is assumed that a representative company pollutes water bodies with its production and can use pollution abatement technologies to comply with environmental regulations. These water bodies are used by a public utility that provides drinking water to the economy. This paper focuses on the review of the Colombian CAC environmental regulation, which moved from controlling a percentage of pollution to defining specific amounts of pollutants discharged, and its interaction with an environmental tax, which makes it a hybrid policy. Although the new CAC is stricter in principle, we conclude that for different values of the model parameters, a hybrid environmental policy requires periodic revision of pollutant discharge limits as well as a complementary environmental tax that approximates the Pigouvian tax to ensure water bodies’ resilience.
