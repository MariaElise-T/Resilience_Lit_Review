Introduction: The study explored effectiveness of emotional intelligence training on resilience of parents with abnormal children in Tehran. Methods: This is an applied research conducted using a quasi-experimental method with control and experimental groups. The statistical population consisted of all parents of abnormal children in exceptional schools of Tehran. To determine the sample size, 120 individuals including 60 pairs of parents of abnormal children were selected. The samples were randomly selected from 5 exceptional schools in Tehran. As a pre-test, Connor and Davidson (2003) resilience questionnaires were filled by the subjects. The experimental group underwent emotional intelligence training for 20 sessions of 1.5 hours (two sessions per week). The control group did not receive any training. After the training course, the resilience of both groups was re-measured. The data was analyzed via SPSS. Results: Emotional intelligence training was effective in increasing resilience of parents with abnormal children (p = 0.001). In addition, the average resilience of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder was significantly higher than the parents of children with physical and intellectual disabilities. However, there was no significant difference in the mean resilience between the parents of children with physical and intellectual disabilities.
