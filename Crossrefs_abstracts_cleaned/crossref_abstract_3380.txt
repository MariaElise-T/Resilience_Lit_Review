The paper specifically explores the corollary benefits for economic development and environmental sustainability of a low-carbon, climate-resilient, green pathway for Ethiopia—a pathway that is consistent with attaining the country’s medium- and long-term development goals. The analysis compares a net zero emissions (NZE) pathway with a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The BAU scenario embeds optimistic (high) economic growth assumptions from Ethiopia’s 10-Year Development Plan, and it incorporates the gradual and early incremental adoption of several climate initiatives proposed in the Climate Resilience and Green Economy Strategy. The NZE scenario builds on the implementation of Ethiopia’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) by 2030. The NZE scenario also incorporates additional climate policy options (adaptation and mitigation), resulting in net zero emissions by 2050.
