PurposeSuicide deaths are a major concern in people with schizophrenia diagnoses. However, many people with such diagnoses do not attempt suicide, nor die by suicide, suggesting that some individuals are resilient to the impact of suicide triggers. This systematic literature review aimed to (1) appraise the evidence for psychological factors which confer resilience to suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and (2) categorize these psychological factors into broader psychological constructs which characterize resilience.MethodsThe review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for the reporting of systematic reviews. A literature search of four electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE) was conducted. A quality evaluation of the included studies was carried out by two independent researchers using a quality assessment tool.ResultsPsychological factors from 27 studies were categorized into four constructs: (1) perceived social support, (2) holding religious and spiritual beliefs, (3) identifying reasons for living, and (4) perceived positive personal skills and attributes.ConclusionsThe limited literature showed that resilience is important in understanding suicidal thoughts and behaviours in people with schizophrenia diagnoses. There is a need for prospective research that investigates moderating effects of psychological resilience in the pathways to suicidal thoughts and behaviours in people with schizophrenia diagnoses.Practitioner points


Novel evidence for four psychological constructs which may confer resilience to suicidal thoughts and behaviours in people with schizophrenia diagnoses.


Strong evidence for the impact of perceived social support and appraisals of personal skills and attributes on the severity of suicidal experiences in people with schizophrenia diagnoses.


There was equivocal evidence for the effect of holding religious and spiritual beliefs on suicide attempts.


Clinical practice would benefit from assessing perceived personal attributes and levels of social support from significant others and health professionals.
