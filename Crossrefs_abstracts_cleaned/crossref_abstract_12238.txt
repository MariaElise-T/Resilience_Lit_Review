The proposed treatment is structured, time limited, and integrates elements from 1995 work of Spiegel and the Yalom 1995 theory of group therapy as well as empirically derived resilience factors. Addressing the psychological specificity of breast cancer, the overall treatment goals are to help patients to acquire new coping skills for relieving stress, to increase their personal and social competence and their use of available social support, to increase family coherence, to enhance optimism and quality of life, and to help patients develop new values and priorities that comply with their current and future life situation.
