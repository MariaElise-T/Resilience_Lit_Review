Introduction: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of positive thinking skills training based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on nurses' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 1400.
Methods: The current research is a semi-experimental interventional study with a pre-test and post-test design, the statistical population of which was made up of nurses working in the hospitals of Abadeh and Euclid cities in Fars province in 1400. Based on the inclusion criteria, 98 nurses were selected and randomly divided into two intervention(n=49) and control(n=49) groups. For the intervention, positive thinking training was conducted face-to-face and group discussion in eight 120-minute sessions, twice a week. The duration of training was two months. To collect data, questionnaires of demographic characteristics, Connor and Davidson's resilience and positive thinking were used. Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 26 and using statistical tests.
Results: Based on the findings of this research, the average post-test resilience of nurses in the intervention group (60/02 ± 6/2) was significantly higher than the control group (52/6 ± 3/5). The average positive thinking of nurses in the post-test was 176/6 ± 4/75 and control group (85/04 ± 5/1). Also, after teaching positive thinking skills, the mean resilience score and its dimensions in the intervention group (89/6±3/1) were significantly higher than the control group (53/18±3/6) (P<0/001).
Conclusion: Positive thinking skills training is a safe, low-cost, and practicable approach whose effectiveness was proven in this study. It could, therefore, be widely used as an empowerment program.
