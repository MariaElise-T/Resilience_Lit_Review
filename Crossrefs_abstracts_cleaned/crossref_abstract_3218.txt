Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (referred to here as autism) is one of several overlapping neurodevelopmental conditions that have variable impacts on different individuals. This variability results from dynamic interactions between biological and non-biological risk factors, which result in increasing differentiation between individuals over time. Although this differentiation continues well into adulthood, the infancy period is when the brain and behavior develop rapidly, and when the first signs and symptoms of autism emerge. This review discusses advances in our understanding of the causal pathways leading to autism and overlapping neurodevelopmental conditions. Research is also mapping trajectories of brain and behavioral development for some risk groups, namely later born siblings of children with autism and/or infants referred because of developmental concerns. This knowledge has been useful in improving early identification and establishing the feasibility of targeted interventions for infant risk groups before symptoms arise. However, key knowledge gaps remain, such as the discovery of protective factors (biological or environmental) that may mitigate the impact of risk. Also, the dynamic mechanisms that underlie the associations between risk factors and outcomes need further research. These include the processes of resilience, which may explain why some individuals at risk for autism achieve better than expected outcomes. Bridging these knowledge gaps would help to provide tools for early identification and intervention that reflect dynamic developmental pathways from risk to outcomes.
