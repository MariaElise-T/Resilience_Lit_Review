Adverse events like energy supply shortages seem to be ubiquitous nowadays. They can negatively affect organizations to varying degrees. In case organizations are negatively affected by adverse events, they need to deal with such circumstances. The concept of resilience is a promising approach supporting organizations if adverse circumstances occur. Against this background, a novel maturity model to analyze and assess resilience capabilities of organizations or units thereof is proposed that aim to deal with adverse circumstances. The maturity model consists of three dimensions, twelve attributes and six stages that together form its structural design. For validation purposes a workshop with professionals working for different departments of a private-sector company has been conducted. The workshop generally reveals the suitability of the maturity model to assess the resilience of organizational units. Workshop participants especially value the maturity model with regard to transparency, comprehensiveness, comparability and the ability to provide indications for resilience improvements.
