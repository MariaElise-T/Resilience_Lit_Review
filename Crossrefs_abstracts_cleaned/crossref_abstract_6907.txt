The aim of this research is to review the relationship between university students’ resilience and levels of social exclusion and forgiveness. Study group of the research includes 355–206 (58%) female and 149 (42%) male–students who marked at least one item in Risk Factors Determination List. This study is a correlational survey model. The Resilience Scale, The Risk Factors Determination List, The Social Exclusion Scale for Adolescents and Forgiveness Scale are used as data collection tools. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation coefficient and Multiple Linear Regression Analysis are used in data analysis. In the wake of correlation analysis, a significant relationship cannot be found between resilience and forgiveness level. A negative and significant relationship is found between resilience and exclusion and negligence sub-dimensions of social exclusion. In the wake of regression analysis, sub-dimensions of social exclusion predict resilience. In order to increase the resilience of university students, rejection by their friends should be minimized, and in order to prevent individuals from being exposed to social exclusion, communication skills can be improved. Social support, which is among the protective factors of resilience, has an important place in life of university students. Therefore, social activities that every student can participate in can be hold.
