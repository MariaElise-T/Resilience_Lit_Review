ABSTRACTIncidents of school and workplace violence are rare but devastating events that can result in significant psychological consequences in communities. The majority of people in the United States will experience some type of traumatic event in their lifetime, but most of them will have no disruption or only transient disruption in functioning. They are either resistant to the development of symptoms or resilient, able to bounce back quickly. By enhancing resistance and promoting resilience, even fewer individuals may develop mental disorders. This article takes a closer look at the concepts of resistance, resilience, and recovery and the need for research on interventions that promote them, in the hope of applying the concepts and interventions to schools and the workplace.
