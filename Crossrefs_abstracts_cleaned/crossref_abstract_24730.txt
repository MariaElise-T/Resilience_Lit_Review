Significance

            In Cambodia, where
            Plasmodium vivax
            and
            Plasmodium falciparum
            are coendemic and intense multimodal malaria-control interventions have reduced malaria incidence,
            P
            .
            vivax
            malaria has proven relatively resistant to such measures. We performed comparative genomic analyses of 150
            P
            .
            vivax
            and
            P
            .
            falciparum
            isolates to determine whether different evolutionary strategies might underlie this species-specific resilience. Demographic modeling and tests of selection show that, in contrast to
            P
            .
            falciparum
            ,
            P
            .
            vivax
            has experienced uninterrupted growth and positive selection at multiple loci encoding transcriptional regulators. In particular, a strong selective sweep involving an AP2 transcription factor suggests that
            P
            .
            vivax
            may use nuanced transcriptional approaches to population maintenance. Better understanding of
            P
            .
            vivax
            transcriptional regulation may lead to improved tools to achieve elimination.
