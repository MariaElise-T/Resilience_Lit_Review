This study aimed to confirm the relationship between resilience, meaning in life, and post-traumatic growth (PTG) among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the mediating effect of meaning in life on the relationship between resilience and PTG was examined. A cross-sectional descriptive research design was used. The participants were 220 nurses at COVID-19-designated hospitals in Seoul. Descriptive statistics, a t-test, ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis, hierarchical regression, and SPSS PROCESS macro (Model 4) were used for data analyses. As a result of the study, resilience and meaning in life each had a significant positive effect on PTG. In addition, the indirect effect of meaning in life was significant, suggesting that meaning in life partially mediated the relationship between resilience and PTG. The results indicate that nurses’ resilience directly contributes to the improvement of PTG, and this relationship is further strengthened indirectly through the presence of meaning in life. Therefore, it is suggested that strategies should be developed to enhance resilience and promote a sense of meaning in the profession in order to support the mental health and foster growth among nurses.
