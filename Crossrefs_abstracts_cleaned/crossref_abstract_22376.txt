Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The results showed that the households of migrant women selling jamu gendong survived and adapted to the migration destinations to prevent poverty. This was attributed to the livelihood strategy of business diversification. In this context, migration was exclusively practiced by women without family members who rented accommodation together. This research identified different forms of capital these women possess, including their productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong, physical capital encompassing road infrastructure, marketplaces, access to health and education facilities, and natural, social, and financial capital. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.
