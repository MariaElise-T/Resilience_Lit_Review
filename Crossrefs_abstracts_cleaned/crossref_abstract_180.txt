Abstract. To better understand factors shaping adaptive behavior
and resilience is crucial in designing policy strategies to prepare people
for future flooding. The central question of our paper is how frequent flood
experience (FFE) impacts adaptive behavior and self-reported resilience. The
applied empirical methods are binary logistic and linear regression models
using data from a panel dataset including 2462Â residents (Germany, state of
Saxony). Four main conclusions from the investigations can be drawn. First,
more flood-experienced respondents are statistically significantly more
likely to have taken precautionary measures in the past. Second, FFE has a
statistically significant negative impact on self-reported resilience.
Third, the impact of FFE on the capacity to recover and the capacity to
resist is statistically significantly non-linear. Fourth, putting together
these results reveals the paradox of more flood-experienced respondents
being better prepared but feeling less resilient at the same time. It can be
concluded that more research is needed to obtain deeper insights into the
drivers behind self-reported resilience and that this study can be seen as a
piece of the puzzle, taking frequent flood experience as the primary entry
point.
