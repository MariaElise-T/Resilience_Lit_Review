 The purpose of the phenomenological and grounded qualitative study in this article was to explore resilient traits of children, aged 9 to 12, who experienced the death of a parent within the past 36 months. The researcher assisted the children in narrating and writing their stories about parental loss and adaptation by posing questions guided by a review of literature framed in an ecological context. Data were coded and analyzed, uncovering themes of resilience. Implications for school counselors working with students who have parental grief experiences are discussed.
