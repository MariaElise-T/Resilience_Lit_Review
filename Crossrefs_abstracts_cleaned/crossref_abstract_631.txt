The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm does represent an effective approach aimed at enhancing the performance of core networks by introducing a clean separation between the routing plane and the forwarding plane. However, the centralized architecture of SDN networks raises resiliency concerns that are addressed by a class of algorithms falling under the Controller Placement Problem (CPP) umbrella term. Such algorithms seek the optimal placement of the SDN controller. In this paper, we evaluate the main CPP algorithms and provide an experimental analysis of their performance, as well as of their capability to dynamically adapt to network malfunctions and disconnections.
