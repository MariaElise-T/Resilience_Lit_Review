On November 21, 2022, Phil Gratton, an executive public servant at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), currently on interchange as Associate Faculty with the Canada School of Public Serviceâ€™s (CSPS) Digital Academy, gave a presentation on Threat Resilience in the Realm of Misinformation, Disinformation, and Trust at the 2022 West Coast Security Conference. The presentation was followed by a question-and-answer period with questions from the audience and CASIS-Vancouver executives. The key points discussed were the harms caused by state-sponsored disinformation campaigns, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate and counter the spread of disinformation, as well as the importance of critical thinking and collaborative response to build resilience against these threats.
