AbstractChildren and adolescents in residential care often face multiple traumatic experiences. However, some individuals show resilient adaptation. To depict this heterogeneity, the person-centered examination of different classes of adaptation is a powerful tool. Up to date, resilience was insufficiently addressed in this population. Data from 141 children and adolescents in residential care institutions in Austria regarding trauma history, psychopathology, behavioral adjustment, and protective factors were assessed with standardized self-report questionnaires. Distinct classes of adaptation after traumatic experiences were examined with Latent Class Analysis. Class differences regarding traumatic experiences and protective factors were analyzed with Ï‡2 testing. Three classes were identified [resilience (66.18%), mixed psychopathology (13.97%, mixed), high psychopathology (19.85%, high)]. Only males were classified into the resilient class and only females into the high class. The high class differed significantly from the resilient class regarding cumulative trauma history and protective factors. The mixed class did not differ from the resilient class regarding trauma history, however, they differed significantly regarding protective factors. The resilient class was associated with protective factors. Strong gender differences show the relevance of a differentiated evaluation of gender-specific protective factors and resilience indicators. Fostering protective factors may be a suitable approach for tailored intervention measures.
