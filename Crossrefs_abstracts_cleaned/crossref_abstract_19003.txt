AbstractGreenhouse gases (GHG) such as CH4and CO2are emitted from wastes at the Piyungan Integrated Waste Management Facility. Integrated Waste Management Facility is called asTempat Pembuangan Sampah Terpaduin Indonesian, and abbreviated as TPST Piyungan. Both CH4and CO2gasses are potential to trigger climate change. Therefore, local institutions are required to intensify efforts towards preventing the harmful effect on climate change. This study aimed to determine the involvement of local institutions in handling waste problems in the TPST as one of the strategies to mitigate climate change. A qualitative approach was used to identify three factors of climate resilience including urban systems (infrastructure), social agents (stakeholders), and local institutions while quantitative scoring methods were used, based on the recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to determine the waste management strategies. The results showed the Integrated Waste Management Facility in Piyungan has not been able to reduce CH4emissions. The urban systems or infrastructure of the facility were found to be in a moderate while the social agents or stakeholders and local institutions were in a good category. However, the participation of local institutions has a major influence on climate change mitigation.
