 Nowadays, the management of soil resources for global food security is one of the strategic purposes of the countries. In this regard, creating soil nutritionâ€™s supply chain network for the fertility of agricultural fields is one of the most critical priorities of the government. In the above strategic network, we are faced with uncertain parameters that show a complex behavior under time, geography, and market changes. This parametric uncertainty is aggravated by the occurrence of disruptions such as sanctions and natural disasters, with devastating effects on strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. In this paper, by adopting a set of reactive and preventive strategies, the resilient supply chain network of dependent petrochemical industries is presented, consistent with the structure of its production cycle in Iran. To cope with the uncertainty, a robust programming approach was extended into flexible-possibilistic programming. The final model controls the uncertainty and risk-aversion of output decisions and effectively confronts the adverse effects of disruptions. Finally, using a real industrial study, the effectiveness and applicability of the final model are explained. Furthermore, by providing efficient solutions, mean cost and minimum standard deviations were achieved.
