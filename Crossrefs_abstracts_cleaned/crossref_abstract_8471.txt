Case studies are presented of deaf high school students who were identified as "outstandingly successful" in a national survey. In the analysis of case histories, a subgroup of students had achieved success despite numerous stressful circumstances. Students who would have been expected to do poorly were nonetheless achieving. Although from different sociocultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, these students appeared to have one attribute in common: a high level of resilience. The study explores resilience and how three deaf students were able to overcome many obstacles to achievement.
