The assessment of resilience of health infrastructures during an epidemic crisis is a fundamental issue in civil engineering, as shown by the recent COVID-19 crisis. During epidemic crises, health services and infrastructures need to maintain a level of functionality and avoid failures. In addition, it is important to evaluate post-hazard procedures, such as emergency and recovery actions. In this regard, the paper applied resilience as a parameter to assess investments, countermeasures and mitigations. The Resilience-Based (RB) methodology herein proposed was then applied to quantify the resilience of health infrastructure systems by considering the recovery of four European Countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy) after the first wave of COVID-19. The results demonstrated that the resilience of health system infrastructures (HSI) depends significantly on the policies that every government management appliedâ€”these being ultimately responsible for the differences in respective COVID impacts. In particular, the principal advantage of using resilience lies in its readability by many stakeholders, such as health infrastructure managers, government owners and public authorities.
