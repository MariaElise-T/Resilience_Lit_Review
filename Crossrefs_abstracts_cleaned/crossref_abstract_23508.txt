 The effect of risk message framing on travel intention requires more empirical investigations in long-term high-risk situations like the current COVID-19 pandemic. Based on frame theory, this study employed an experimental design to examine how two contrasting approaches of COVID-19 risk message framing (amplifying vs. attenuating) affected post-pandemic travel intention via the mediation of perceived safety and travel fear, and how resilience and impulsivity as tourist traits moderate these relationships. Survey results based on 481 responses revealed that: (1) risk messages significantly predicted tourists’ perceived safety, travel fear, and travel intention; (2) tourists’ perceived safety and travel fear mediated the effects of risk messages on travel intention; (3) while resilience moderated the effects of message framing on perceived safety and travel intention, impulsivity only moderated the effect of message framing on travel fear. The study provides a theoretical basis and practical implications for destination risk communications.
