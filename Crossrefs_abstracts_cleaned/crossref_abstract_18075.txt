PurposeGiven the heightened imperatives for boosting supply chain resilience (SCR) in industrialized construction (IC), it is essential to explore the correlational impacts of supply chain vulnerabilities (SCV) and supply chain capabilities (SCC) which are the measures of SCR, specifically in Hong Kong where policymakers actively promote IC. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model to explore the correlational impacts of vulnerabilities and capabilities targeting SCR in IC.Design/methodology/approachAfter drawing on the general literature on SCR, empirical research using an expert opinion survey was conducted following the methodological framework of this study. The gathered data were then subjected to the partial least squares structural equation modeling process. Thereby, four hypotheses were formulated and tested for 20 capability–vulnerability relationships.FindingsSeven of the 20 statistical relationships tested were identified to be significant. Accordingly, production-based SCV were identified as the most critical disruptions. “Resourcefulness” could substantially withstand production-based SCV, receiving the highest path significance. An “enablers-results framework” for achieving SCR of IC was also developed based on these findings to help industry practitioners with SCR implementation.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this is the first structured evaluation model that measures the correlational impacts of SCC and SCV targeting SCR in the construction domain. Further, this study adds substantially to the existing SCR and construction “body of knowledge” by proposing a model explaining how various SCV and SCC influence SCR in IC. These findings also inform the industry where and how to deploy critical SCC at appropriate levels, targeting critical SCV, to contain or extirpate them.
