AbstractThe recovery of silicone o‐rings after 23% compression at room temperature (22°C) was determined. Two sets of experiments were performed. To determine the effect of temperature on resiliency, the recovery of o‐rings that had been compressed for 24 h at room temperature was measured at both 22°C and −7°C. To determine the effect of storage under compression on resiliency, the recovery at 22°C of o‐rings compressed at room temperature for 6 months or 1 year was compared with those compressed for 24 h. In addition, the effect of a silicone lubricant on the recovery of the o‐rings was determined. The initial room temperature recovery of silicone o‐rings after being compressed for 6 months is somewhat slower than those compressed for 24 h. There is very little change in the recovery of the o‐rings compressed for 1 year compared with those compressed for 6 months. Recovery after 24 h of compression is slower at −7°C than at 22°C. Silicone oil lubricant appears to aid recovery after 24 h of compression but has little effect after 6 months or 1 year of compression. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2009
