This study aimed to explore he experiences of survivors of the 2017 Marawi siege in the Philippines, focusing on their traumatic experiences, the role of faith in their recovery, and the resilience strategies they used. The Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach was chosen for its strength in exploring deep personal experiences and the meaning individuals attach to them. Through in-depth interviews and purposive sampling, participants with direct experience of the siege were selected. Their stories underwent a rigorous process of case analysis, cross-case analysis, and identification of emerging themes using IPA.  The analysis revealed the profound role of faith in the healing journey of survivors. Deeply connected to Meranaw cultural norms, faith has been shown to be a key coping mechanism that facilitates acceptance, forgiveness and achieving financial stability. These stories not only demonstrated remarkable resilience, but also echoed existing literature on the importance of resilience in trauma recovery. The complex relationship between trauma, faith and resilience was evident, with survivors’ experiences deeply rooted in the cultural values ​​of the Meranaw community.  In conclusion, this study confirms the complex interplay between trauma, faith and resilience and highlights the importance of culturally sensitive post-traumatic interventions. Based on these findings, it is recommended that future interventions include faith-based and culturally sensitive approaches. Given the qualitative nature of the study and the potential for recall bias, further research using mixed methods is advocated for a more comprehensive understanding. The use of IPA enabled a nuanced exploration of survivors’ experiences and ensured the validity of the study. A rigorous analytical process coupled with the identification of new themes further strengthened the reliability of the study. Limitations such as potential recall bias were carefully addressed by cross-referencing the stories and looking for consistent patterns across cases.
