 Stress among social work students is an issue of concern and has adverse outcomes. This study used a longitudinal design to assess stress, resilience and coping in undergraduate social work students in India and a comparative cohort of non-social work undergraduates. Standardised instruments were administered at three time points: the first on course entry, then in the second year of study and finally on the verge of course completion at the end of three years. Moderate levels of stress and resilience were seen in the social work cohort, but no incremental progression in their manifestation was observed as students progressed through their degree. Stress, problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies emerged as significant predictors of resilience. The findings indicate a need to develop resilience in social work students to enable them deal more effectively with various stressors.
