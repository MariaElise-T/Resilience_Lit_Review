AbstractThe global climate change and resource depletion crisis require rethinking business models that drive the production and consumption of goods and services. This requires transdisciplinary and systemic reconfiguration and a critical evaluation of traditional economic, business, and management constructs. This research provides a systematic literature review of how the constructs of sustainability, resilience, and sustainable business models have been defined and applied in the economic, business, and management academic literature from 1990 until 2022. The key contributions of this paper are (1) a review of how sustainability, resilience, and sustainable business models have been defined in the literature, (2) an identification of the interfaces and lack thereof between these constructs, and (3) an outline of the gaps and limitations and need for further research to address the knowledge gaps.
