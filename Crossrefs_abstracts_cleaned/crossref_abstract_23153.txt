AbstractAims and objectivesThis study aimed to compare anxiety, resilience, and depression between COVID‐19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non‐COVID‐19 unit nurses and assess their effects on depression.BackgroundNurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 unit nurses.DesignDescriptive research study.MethodsThis study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID‐19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative‐pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non‐COVID‐19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines.ResultsAnxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID‐19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID‐19 patients and non‐COVID‐19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID‐19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID‐19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non‐COVID‐19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively.ConclusionsAmong nurses working in COVID‐19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety.Relevance to clinical practiceThe nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up‐to‐date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources.
