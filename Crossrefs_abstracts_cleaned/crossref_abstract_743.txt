 Using a mixed method of inquiry of 49 women at a halfway house in New Jersey, this exploratory study evaluated factors of risk and resilience that impact incarcerated mothers. A quantitative analysis of the sample provided insights into this halfway house population, and a content analysis of case files revealed themes related to intergenerational factors and motherâ€“child relationships. Practice, policy, and research implications of this study are discussed.
