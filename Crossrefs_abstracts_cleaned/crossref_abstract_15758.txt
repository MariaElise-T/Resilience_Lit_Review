Abstract
This study analyses the resilience of peri-urban communities in the face of increasingly complex and dynamic global climate change to environmental impact. This study aims to understand the characteristics of peri-urban societies, the factors that influence their resilience, and strategies needed to increase their resilience in the face of climate change. This study uses a qualitative approach with a case study method in Kebalen, Bekasi, and one peri-urban city in Indonesia. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and document analysis. The results showed that the diverse characteristics of peri-urban communities affect their resilience in the face of climate change. Factors such as resources, accessibility, and social support also affect the resilience levels of peri-urban societies. Strategies needed to increase the resilience of peri-urban communities include collaboration in community empowerment, education, and training in local resource management disasters as well as improving infrastructure and accessibility. This study contributes to the understanding of the role of peri-urban communities in addressing the impacts of global climate change. It produces recommendations for the government, private sector, and community disaster management to synergize and increase the resilience of peri-urban communities.
