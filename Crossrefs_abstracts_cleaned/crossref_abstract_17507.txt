This study aims to identify the factors related to resilience of the families of children with Down syndrome (DS). Data were collected from 126 parents of children with DS in Korea, using a self‚Äêadministered questionnaire. The age of the child, developmental level of the child, parental depression, and stress and strain were negatively related with family adaptation, whereas health of parents, family cohesiveness, flexibility, communication skills, supportive family/relatives, and quality of community service were positively related. Parental depression, family cohesiveness and communication skills were the factors that were strongly related to family resilience and adaptation. It is suggested that nursing interventions to decrease parental depression and increase family cohesiveness and communication skills should be included to increase resilience of the families of children with DS.
