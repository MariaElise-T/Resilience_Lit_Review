<p>The present research investigates the mediating role of resiliency in the relationship to life satisfaction and happiness. The study uses correlation and the research population consisted of 241 female students from the University of Tehran who were chosen with the simple random sampling method to answer the questionnaires. To measure the variables of the research, the scale of life satisfaction proposed by Diener et al. (1985), the resiliency of Conner and Davidson (2003), and Oxford happiness (1989) were utilized. The results which were attained using the method of structural equation modeling demonstrated that the exogenous variable of life satisfaction has a significant direct effect on happiness. In addition, according to the results, the relationship between life satisfaction and happiness is mediated by resiliency. In this pattern, all the regression weights were significant from a statistical perspective, and in general, the results show that life satisfaction affects happiness directly and via the mediation of resiliency.</p>
