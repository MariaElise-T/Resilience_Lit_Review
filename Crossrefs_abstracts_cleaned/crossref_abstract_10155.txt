Enhancing the index of crisis resilience is one of the key goals in medical environments. Various parameters can affect crisis resilience. The current study was designed to analyze crisis resilience in medical environments based on the crisis management components. This cross-sectional and descriptive-analytical study was performed in 14 hospitals and medical centers, in 2020. A sample size of 343.5 was determined based on the Cochran's formula. We used a 44-item crisis management questionnaire of Azadian et al. to collect data. The components of this questionnaire included management commitment, error learning, culture learning, awareness, preparedness, flexibility, and transparency. The data was analyzed based on the structural equation modeling approach using IBM SPSS AMOS v. 23.0. The participants’ age and work experience mean were 37.78±8.14 and 8.22±4.47 years. The index of crisis resilience was equal to 2.96±0.87. The results showed that all components of crisis management had a significant relationship with this index (p <0.05). The highest and lowest impact on the resilience index were related to preparedness (E=0.88) and transparency (E=0.60). The goodness of fit indices of this model including RMSEA, CFI, NFI, and NNFI (TLI) was 2.86, 0.071, 0.965, 0.972, and 0.978. The index of crisis resilience in the medical environments was at a moderate level. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling findings indicated that the impact of each component of crisis management should be considered in prioritizing measures to increase the level of resilience.
