Using structural equation modeling, the authors evaluated a path model developed on the basis of resilience–stress theories. Participants were college students in the United States (n = 207), China (n = 209), and Taiwan (n = 212). The relationships among stress, trait resilience, self‐efficacy, secure attachment, and active coping were consistent across the 3 samples. These results may be related to the Westernization of Chinese and Taiwanese college students in the process of globalization. Practical and theoretical implications of the results are discussed.
