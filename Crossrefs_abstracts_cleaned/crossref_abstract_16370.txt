The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has brought to light the underlying technology known as Blockchain. This innovation is a decentralized information management system that allows for the recording of digital asset transactions without the need for institutional intermediaries. The potential of Blockchain to revolutionize the management of companies, particularly in the context of supply chain risk management, is immense due to the complex and vulnerable nature of the supply chain. This article aims to highlight the impact of the Blockchain on the risks observed in the Supply Chain by examining how this innovation can strengthen the resilience of these chains in times of increased threat and uncertainty. Our study, which utilizes a bibliometric analysis, highlights the role of Blockchain technology in mitigating various risks, including those related to fraud, errors, loss of information, and supply chain failure. It should be noted that the implementation of environmental supply chain practices requires the commitment and participation of all stakeholders involved in the supply chain, as well as favorable policies and incentives from governments and institutions to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. The key features of Blockchain, including real-time transparency, traceability, and automated smart contract management, enable risk mitigation and contribute to the overall resilience of green supply chains.
