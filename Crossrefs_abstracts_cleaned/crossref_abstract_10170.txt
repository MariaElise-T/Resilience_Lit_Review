Abstract
One barrier to developing resilience-enhancing interventions for dementia care partners is a lack of an objective measure to capture resilience-related behaviors. To validate a behavioral framework of resilience in dementia care partners for future measure and intervention, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 care partners who experienced challenges created by a health crisis of their care recipients. We used abductive thematic analysis to identify 14 resilience-related behaviors care partners adopted to recover from care challenges. These behaviors included four problem-response behaviors, three help-related behaviors, three self-growth behaviors, two compassion-related behaviors, and two learning-related behaviors. Twelve care partners reported full recovery from the effects of their challenging experiences. Ten care partners reported partial recovery in the face of PLWDâ€™s declining health and their own unmet needs, and four care partners felt not at all recovered. This finding suggests new intervention targets for enhancing care partner resilience.
