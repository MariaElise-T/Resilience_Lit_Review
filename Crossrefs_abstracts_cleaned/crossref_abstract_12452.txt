Consensus control of multiagent systems (MASs) has been one of the most extensive research topics in the field of robotics and automation. The information sharing among the agents in the MASs depends upon the communication network because the interaction of agents may affect the consensus performance of the agents in a communication network. An unexpected fault and attack may occur on one agent and can propagate through the communication network into other agents. Thus, this may cause severe degradation of the whole MASs. In this paper, we first discussed MAS technologies. After that available technologies for the modeling of attacks and fundamental issues due to attacks on MAS attacks were discussed. We also introduced cooperative attack methodologies and model-based attack methodology. Objective of this article is to provide comprehensive study on recent advances in consensus control of MASs under attacks covering the published results until 2021. This survey presents different kinds of attacks, their estimation and detection, and resilient control against attacks. At the end, the survey accomplishes some potential recommendations for future direction to solve the key issues and challenges reported for secure consensus control of MASs.
