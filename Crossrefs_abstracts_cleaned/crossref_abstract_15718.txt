 The purpose of this study was to look at small business owners’ entrepreneurial resilience and mental well-being during adversity. This paper tries to gauge the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on an entrepreneur’s mental wellness and how being resilient in their approach to handling uncertainties mediates and positively envisages their mental wellness. The quantitative approach was utilized to collect data and achieve the specified goal. The information was gathered from 159 small business owners in Varanasi, India. The partial least squares method was used to analyze the collected data. Future research should look for more accurate ways to measure resilience as well as personal traits that could be used to further analyze the person–entrepreneurial context fit. In order to improve the generalizability of the study’s findings, researchers can also consider perceived adversity and resilience as mediating factors, in addition to the actual adversity and resilience assessed in this study.
