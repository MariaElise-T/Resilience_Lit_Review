Abstract
An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm is essentially a network of UAV agents in which coordinating interaction and dependencies are important for successful mission execution. However, the environment that they work in is susceptible to many potential disruptions, such as external weather factors or internal component malfunctions. These disrupt operation and adversely impact overall system performance. To prevent a high rate of mission failure, UAV swarms must exhibit a certain degree of resiliency to disruptions. This study conducts a bibliographical analysis of research on resiliency in UAV swarms over the last decade, and key insights into essential constructs necessary to engineer resilient behavior in UAV swarms are documented. This study also lays the groundwork for future analysis on UAV swarms, with a particular focus on incorporating resiliency to improve performance in the face of disruptions.
