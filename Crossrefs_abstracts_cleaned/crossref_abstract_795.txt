Climate  change  is  a  critical  issue  for  all  of  humanity.  It  is  predicted  that  Thailand  is  likely  to  have  an  increasing  frequency  and  intensity  of  rainfall  and  storms  which,  will  result  in  a  more  severe flash flood problem. Slum residents in Chiang Mai are one of the groups of people who are vulnerable  to  flooding  impacts  of  climate  change.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  analyze  the  flood-resilient  housing  style  of  low-income  people.  Data  from  3  slums  (146  households)  which  encounter  different  kinds  of  floods  every  year,  i.e.  drainage  floods  (Ban  Sanku:  21  households),  river  floods  (Kampang  Ngam:  64  households)  and  flash  floods  (Samunkee  Pattana:  61  house- holds),  were  collected.  The  study  found  that  flood  frequency,  duration,  depth  and  flow  velocity  caused damage  to  the  houses,  but  only  flood  frequency,  duration,  and  flow  velocity  were  factors  affecting the housing structure.  If considering only damage to slums which frequently face shallow water depth, slow flow velocity and short duration, all 8 low-income housing styles (A-H) can be built. The high platform house with open space under the house is appropriate for slums located in flooding area where high-level, slow flow velocit y floods occur frequently but for a short duration. It  may  be  a  permanent,  semi-permanent or temporary structure (D-F).  For  the  other  slums  facing  high  flood  levels  with  high  flow  velocities  for  a  short  duration,  all  permanent  housing  styles  are  appropriate.  If  the  objective  is  not  only  damage  prevention  but  also  living  during  a  flood,  per- manent high platform houses with open spaces under the houses are recommended for all slums.
