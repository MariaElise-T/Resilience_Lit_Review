In this paper, resilience theory is applied to construct an evaluation index system of tourism public services. The entropy weight method, Kernel density and Moran index were used to measure China’s tourism public services development level from 2010 to 2020 and to analyze its spatial–temporal evolution. The results showed that the overall development level of China’s tourism public services had a gentle upward trend; however, the development trend of each subsystem was not completely consistent with the overall development. From the spatial grade distribution, the characteristics of China’s tourism public services presented a clearly higher intensity in the middle region while the values for the two-sided ones were much lower. From the spatial pattern, the weakening trend appeared from the southeast to northwest. The high level and the above trend of concentrated contiguous distribution regions were formed in the eastern region in China, and the distribution regions were transformed into an optimized one in the southwest region in China. From the spatial agglomeration, the characteristics showed that the distribution in the east region was superior to that in the west region, and that in north region was superior to that in the south region. The overall tourism public services development level of each subsystem was improved while there were obstacles in its balanced development. The tourism entertainment services, tourism human resources and tourism safety services were the obstacle factors to the tourism public services development.
