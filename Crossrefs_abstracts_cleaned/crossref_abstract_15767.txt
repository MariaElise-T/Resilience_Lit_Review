Agroforestry, as the synergistic integration of woody perennials with crops and livestock systems, is posited along with a multi-functional land-use strategy with substantial implications for climate adaptation and mitigation. The article embarks on an analytical journey through historical paradigms, typologies such as silvo-pastoral and agro-silvicultural systems, and evaluates their contributions to enhancing soil health, water management, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and microclimate regulation. Distinctive case studies spanning diverse geographic regions including Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe and South America are scrutinized to elucidate how agroforestry initiatives can be contextually optimized for addressing region-specific environmental challenges and socio-economic needs. Sustainability aspects are dissected into economic, social, and environmental benefits, thereby constructing a holistic view of the multi-dimensional advantages of agroforestry systems. The review identifies significant research lacunae, anticipates technological innovations such as remote sensing and machine learning algorithms for data-driven management, and delineates strategies for scaling up best practices. Additionally, the article explores the impediments to widespread adoption, which encompass land tenure complications, economic viability, socio-cultural factors, and policy and regulatory constraints. In the review accentuates the need for an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving concerted efforts from researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders for the actualization of agroforestry's full potential in achieving global sustainability and climate resilience objectives.
