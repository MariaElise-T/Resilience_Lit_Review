Objective In this study, it was aimed to research the connection between psychological resilience, alexithymia, depression, anxiety and impulsivity in patients who attempted suicide with drugs. Methods The patient group ( n = 66) who attempted suicide with drugs and the control group ( n = 66) without any psychiatric diagnosis were examined in the study. Sociodemographic data form, Psychological Resilience Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) were used in the study. Results It was found that PRS dedication and challenge are significantly higher in the control group ( p = .039 and p = .003, respectively). When the undiagnosed group who attempted suicide were compared with the control group, it was observed that there is a significant difference between BIS-11 total and TAS total after bonferonni correction (respectively; p = .002; p = .001), while, there is no statistically significant difference in terms of PRS total score ( p = .483) Conclusion It was observed that patients who attempted suicide with drugs had low levels of psychological resilience, high alexithymia levels. In the absence of an additional diagnosis of depression, psychological resilience did not differ in terms of suicide attempts. In the suicide group, those who did not receive any additional diagnosis were not more impulsive than those who were depressed.
