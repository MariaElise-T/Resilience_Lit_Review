Family communal spaces have multiple functions and can accommodate the activities of individuals and families. These spaces accommodate the life of gotong royong, which is a form of solidarity and togetherness in the form of local wisdom of the Indonesian people. Families apply this traditional concept in space and create cohesion through intense interaction between families, which will have an impact on the security and resilience of settlement against negative things that come from society and the environment. The purpose of this study is to examine how interactions influenced by local wisdom and the environment create cohesion, which has an impact on community and environmental resilience in coastal settlements. The research method uses geographic methods with socio-spatial analysis and behavioral mapping methods with place-central mapping analysis. The study shows cohesion between families increases because of the high-intensity meetings and a sense of belonging and togetherness as a family. Unity with the environment is also formed because of their livelihood as fishermen who have close relationships with the sea and the coast. In addition to cohesion, the family communal space creates community and environmental resilience because of the additional functions as areas of family and environmental control.
