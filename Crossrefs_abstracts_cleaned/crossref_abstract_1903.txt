 Resilience engineering has introduced a number of new ideas into safety science, capitalizing on similarities to some safety fields within human factors yet distancing itself from other fields like human reliability analysis (HRA). Resilience engineering highlights important new aspects of safety that should be further considered in HRA and other areas of safety. However, resilience engineering does not represent a paradigm shift away from HRA. As this paper will demonstrate, to a great extent, concepts explored by resilience engineering are already covered by HRA. This paper reviews core assumptions of HRA and resilience engineering and then presents a discussion of: (i) three ways in which HRA can fortify the emerging field of resilience engineering and (ii) two ways in which resilience engineering can infuse important new concepts into HRA. This paper argues that in order to achieve this mutual benefit, it is important to reconcile the two fields.
