 Although the literature on positive adjustment following traumatic events is growing, only a few studies have examined this phenomenon in young refugees. Using the social-ecological framework, the aim of this study was to identify factors and processes that according to young refugees promote their resilience. A total of 16 treatment-seeking refugees aged 13–21 years, living in the Netherlands, were interviewed. Data analysis revealed four resilience strategies: (1) acting autonomously, (2) performing at school, (3) perceiving support from peers and parents, and (4) participating in the new society. These strategies interacted with one another and demonstrated the interrelatedness between individuals and their social context. Having to wait long for a residence permit and being older appeared to negatively influence participants’ resilience strategies. These findings suggest that resilience refers to a dynamic process that is context and time specific.
