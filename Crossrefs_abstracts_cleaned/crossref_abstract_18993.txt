The current global situation is complex and volatile. Thus, promoting the construction of a resilient digital innovation ecosystem has become an important issue for regional innovation development. Based on panel data from 30 Chinese provinces and cities, this study empirically investigated the current situation and resilience level of China’s regional digital innovation ecosystem development using a global entropy method, a technique for order performance by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), Moran’s I, obstacles, and panel models. The results indicate that the resilience level of China’s regional digital innovation ecosystem will grow from 2011 to 2021. Spatially, it showed a spatial distribution of “coastal high–central flat–northwest depression,” with inter-regional “low coupling” and intra-regional “high cohesion” characteristics. The global Moran’s I was greater than zero, decreasing by 43.860% from 2011 to 2021, and the scope of the “high-high” quadrant and the “low-high” quadrant has been expanding and narrowing, respectively. The state and response indicators were the main obstacles to the resilience development of the regional digital innovation ecosystem, and the obstacle degree of the pressure indicators increased during the survey period. Industrial structure, regional urbanization, human capital, and digital industrialization have made significant positive contributions to regional digital innovation ecosystem resilience overall, and the drivers were regionally heterogeneous in space. Finally, this study proposes strategies for improving the resilience of regional digital innovation ecosystems, including strengthening top-level design, differentiated development, and lowering obstacles.
