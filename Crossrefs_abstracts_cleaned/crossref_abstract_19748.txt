Abstract
This research investigates the relationship between city resilience and its urban systems. The study determines the efficiency of a healthy urban system as one of a main characteristic in achieving a compatible resilient city. Most of the current studies are theoretical and suggest pathways and procedures that are beyond virtual practices. Healthy urban systems are suggested to link human well-being with the effectiveness of the city infra-structure and municipal services. These services are associated with the drinking water supply, sewage disposal, garbage system, and adequacy of the transport system. Many recent approaches have agreed on the importance of these elements related to resilience. However, any involvement in operation of these elements may lead to all types of pollution. This may eventually affect the nature of the urban system and reduce the cityâ€™s resilience to pressure and disasters. The study intends to explore this relationship in the city of Baghdad. This city has faced accelerated disasters for many years. The research attempts to determine the resilience pathway of Baghdad and investigate its ability based on its urban system. The research concludes that sound healthy urban systems are one of the most effective pathways to achieve resilience in the city of Baghdad. Introduction.
