PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors influencing on resilience in adolescents with cancer.METHODS: The participants consisted of 107 parents and 107 adolescents who aged ten and eighteen diagnosed with cancer more than six months and currently receiving outpatient treatment or further management after off-therapy. Data was collected using self-report questionnaires and analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and multiple regression.RESULTS: Resilience was significantly different by religion (t=2.472, p=.045) and number of cancer treatment regimens (F=3.155, p=.047). Family problem-solving communication was also significant by number of cancer treatment regimens (F=3.582, p=.031). The higher social support showed the stronger family hardiness and the better family problem-solving communication. In addition, a positive relationship was found between Family Hardiness Index (FHI) (r=.193, p=.046), Family Problem Solving Communication (FPSC) (r=.226, p=.019) and resilience of adolescents with cancer. FPSC (beta=.356, p=.045) and religion (beta=.441, p=.002) were predictive factors at ages 10-12, FHI (beta=.509, p=.029) and FPSC (beta=.503, p=.037) were predictive factors at ages 13-15 on resilience of adolescents with cancer that explained 16.0% and 24.3% respectively.CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that nursing interventions should focus on enhancing family resilience and resilience of adolescents with cancer.
