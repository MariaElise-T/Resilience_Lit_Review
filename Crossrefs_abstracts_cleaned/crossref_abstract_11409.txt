 District nursing (DN) teams deliver high-quality, complex care under extremely difficult circumstances. DN team resilience depends on the balance between capacity (funding and staff availability) and demand (workload and both clinical and quality standards). The caseload is where capacity and demand meet. Resilience in teams is stretched to the limits and often breached, despite which district nurses remain positive about their role. The overwhelming issue appears to be high workload exacerbated by staff shortages and increasing referrals to DN services. The time is rapidly approaching when district nurses may not be able to keep their caseloads open. If demand and capacity are to be better aligned, the demand should be better predicted, so that lead times are considered and resources are available.
