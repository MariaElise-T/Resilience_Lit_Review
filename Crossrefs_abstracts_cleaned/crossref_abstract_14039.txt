Abstract
Nationwide, nursing students experienced multiple interruptions in learning because of the pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on resilience and self-compassion. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to examine pandemic-related factors, resilience, and self-compassion using the Brief Resilience and Self-Compassion scales. The majority of participants (n = 259, 73.4 percent) described declining mental health. There was a moderate relationship between resilience, self-compassion, and age (r = .30, n = 353, p = .00/r = .290, n = 353, p < .01). Resilience and self-compassion are integral to student success. Strategies to support studentsâ€™ mental and physical health are discussed.
