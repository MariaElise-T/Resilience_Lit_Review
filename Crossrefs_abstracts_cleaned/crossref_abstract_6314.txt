To deal with the chronic illness is one of the difficult tasks. Resilience and positive emotions in patients could enhance coping strategies and reduce disease complications. This study aimed to determine the level of resilience as an important predictor of mental well-being among cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. As the disease progresses, it carries with it a tremendous increase of mental health consequences such as depression. This study provides an important contribution to a growing field of research of resilience that tries to predict the mental well-being of cardiovascular patients. This study was conducted on 100 CVD patients referring to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College & Hospital (JNMCH, A.M.U, Aligarh, India). The study included two groups of cardiovascular patients, each of 50 members. Group 1 consisted of male cardiovascular patients and group 2 consisted of female cardiovascular patients. Data were collected using the Resilience Scale (Wagnild & Young, 1993) and Mental Well-Being Questionnaire (Tennant et al., 2007). Significant correlation was observed between the resilience level and mental health of cardiovascular patients. Resilience was found to be a strong predictor of mental well-being among both the groups (males and females).
