BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, and countries along the Belt and Road (B&amp;R) route have also been hit hard. However, the impact varied greatly from country to country, some severely and others mildly. What factors have led to such a wide variation?MethodIn this paper, we considered institutional, infrastructural, economic, social, and technological resilience as components of overall anti-pandemic resilience, and constructed a set of indicators to evaluate this resilience for B&amp;R countries in 2020. We evaluated the anti-pandemic resilience using the combined empowermentâ€“VIKOR method, and classified the countries into different resilience levels by means of hierarchical clustering. The validity of the evaluation indicator system was verified by analyzing the consistency between the actual performance and the assessed resilience.ResultsThe ranking results showed that Israel and Bahrain were representative of countries that had the highest resilience, Hungary and Estonia represented countries with moderate resilience, and Laos and Cambodia represented countries with the lowest resilience. We also found that countries with high resilience had much better institutional and economic resilience than countries with moderate resilience, whereas countries with low resilience lagged behind in both infrastructural and social resilience. Based on these findings, policy recommendations were offered to help B&amp;R countries respond to future pandemics.
