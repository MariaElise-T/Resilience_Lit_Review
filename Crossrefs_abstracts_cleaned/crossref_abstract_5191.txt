ISO 28000:2022 “Security and Resilience — Security Management Systems — Requirements” is the second edition management system standard that supersedes the first edition (ISO 28000:2007, “Security Management Systems for the Supply Chain”). Both standards include aspects relevant to the supply chain; however, the incumbent (28000:2022) standard omitted notification about the supply chain in the title. So authors are interested in the reason for the accentuation shift as a necessary standard.
The article argues that Resilience now comes to the fore because of poly-crises in the world and Ukraine. It causes the rethinking and balancing actions for many aspects of Resilience and security based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2015), EU Green and Tweens transition (2019), and Paris Agreement (2015), and a paradigm shift from short-term to long-term values to ensure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) externalities for better Sustainability and Resilience.
In Ukraine, DSTU ISO 28000:2008, “Security Management Systems for the Supply Chain” will become obsolete in 2025. After the revision, ISO 28000:2022 covers all aspects of organizations much beyond the supply chain noted in ISO 28002:2011, “Security management systems for the supply chain — Development of resilience in the supply chain — Requirements with guidance for use”.
The author engages in prioritizing implementing ISO 28000:2022 in Ukraine. That is especially important to the nuclear industry with a complicated and safety-significant supply chain.
