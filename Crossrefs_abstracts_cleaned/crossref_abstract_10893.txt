AbstractResilience is the ability to bounce back from a disruption. Of late, applying the concept of resilience to systems and enterprises is gaining importance because major disruptions are becoming more unpredictable, more frequent, and more severe. While there have been some efforts on defining metrics and measuring resilience, there is no generic quantitative approach to resilience that can be used to measure, predict or compare resilience. This paper proposes a generic quantitative approach to defining and measuring resilience. A simple resilience model is introduced using five critical states of a system, and a set of assertions based on a resource based view. These assertions are treated mathematically in the generic resilience model, and a formula for computing resilience is defined. Two simple cases are also discussed to illustrate the usefulness and potential of this approach.
