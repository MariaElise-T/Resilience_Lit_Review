PURPOSE: The purpose of this short communication is to provide theoretical considerations that support Human Resources (HR) professionals’ decisions regarding the development of a post COVID-19 pandemic career resilient Generation Z’s workforce. Building on the work of Pataki-Bittó & Kapusy [1] and Pichler, Kohli & Granitz [2], an effort to provide practical recommendations, that align workplace policies and practices with Generation Z’s work values will be made, in order to develop a resilient workforce. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors review literature on Generation Z, namely regarding the factors that shaped their underlying development and consequent work values. Furthermore, literature regarding current organizational policies and practices focused on this generation was reviewed. FINDINGS: Although the recommendations made here allow worker integration and a better person-organization fit, this conceptual framework also suggests that very little is known about this generation, and as such, no one-size-fits-all recommendation exists for managers. It is our understanding that the recommendations set out here must be adapted to each organizational context, and each manager should pay more attention to its content than its form. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This short communication presents a reflection regarding recommendations, that align workplace policies and practices with Generation Z’s work values, in order to develop a career resilient workforce. It is a work that combines previous works and as such it offers a more encompassing systematization of the latest recommendations regarding this generation.
