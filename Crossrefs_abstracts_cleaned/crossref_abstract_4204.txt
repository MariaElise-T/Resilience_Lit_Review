 Cyclones and the associated floods have recently become a regular problem for many states of India, particularly on its west and east coasts. Odisha (renamed from Orissa in 2011) is a state located along the eastern coast of India that experiences tropical cyclones mainly from the Bay of Bengal. Some of the recent severe cyclonic storms that caused large-scale devastation in Odisha in the last decade include cyclone Amphan in May 2020, cyclone Fani in May 2019, cyclone Titli in October 2018, cyclone Hudhud in October 2014 and cyclone Phailin in October 2013. The roads, being one of the essential lifeline infrastructure facilities, commonly get damaged during these cyclonic floods in terms of floodwater overtopping, erosion of road surfaces, shoulders and embankment slopes, and even the washing out of the whole roadway section. These recent events have indicated that special attention is needed to minimise damage to this vital lifeline infrastructure by developing and adopting climate-resilient road infrastructure. This paper focuses on the damage assessment of transportation infrastructure during the recent cyclones and associated floods in Odisha, and advances some recommendations for possible measures to be taken for the design of cyclone- and flood-resilient road infrastructure.
