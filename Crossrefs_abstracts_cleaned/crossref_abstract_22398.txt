Object and purpose of research. The object of research is a propeller shaft block (PSB). The purpose of study is development of vibration absorbers to reduce the resonance vibration levels for resilient insert disks of propeller shaft block (PSB). Materials and methods. Measurement of vibration spectrum of resilient insert disks with and without vibration absorbers. The efficiency of vibration absorbers is assessed as a difference between vibration levels with and without vibration absorbers. Main results. Mounting of vibration absorbers leads to attenuation of peak resonance levels in vibration spectra of the disk. Conclusion. The feasibility of significant resonance attenuation of resilient insert disks in propeller shaft blocks are shown by mounting small size vibration absorbers giving a large loss of oscillatory power.
