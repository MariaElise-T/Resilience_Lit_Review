Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, complex reproductive syndrome characterized by menstrualirregularities, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. This study aimed to determine the role of resilience and emotional regulation and marital satisfaction in females diagnosed with the polycystic ovarian syndrome. Further, it investigated the predictors of marital satisfaction. 100 females were selected through purposive sampling from different clinics and hospitals in Lahore. State Resilience Scale, Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, and Relationship Assessment Scale were administered. Resilience and emotional regulation subscales i.e. cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression showed a significant positive correlation with marital satisfaction. Regression analysis indicated resilience and cognitive reappraisal were significant positive predictors of marital satisfaction. T-test analysis results of group difference showed that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression were high in participants who do not have acne symptoms. Resilience and marital satisfaction were high in females who do not have irregularity in their menstruation cycle whereas expressive suppression was high in females who have irregularity in the menstruation cycle. This study will help to understand the PCOS problem as a matter of female health which requires attention and care to decrease the social, physical, and emotional problems arising from it.Â
