The complexity of geographical conditions and regional morphology of Padang City have caused it to be at high risk of multi-hazard. Padang City is located near the meeting point of the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, and also on the Sumatra Fault line (Semangko Fault). Therefore, strong infrastructures are needed in order to minimize the impact of the risk of multi-hazard. This study is conducted to measure the resilience of Padang City’s infrastructures toward multi-hazard and provide recommendations to improve the resilience of Padang City’s infrastructures toward Multi-hazard. This study was conducted with qualitative methods and presented quantitatively in the form of diagrams. The measurement is carried out based on the concept of city toughness measurements made by UNISDR known as the "Scorecard". This study only focuses on essential 8 about "Increase Infrastructure Resilience" and essential 10 about "Expedite Recovery and Build Back Better". From this study, it can be concluded that the resilience of Padang City infrastructures is still relatively low so several recommendations that are expected will increase the resilience of Padang City’s infrastructures are proposed, that are; in-depth assessment, data collection and supervision monitoring of infrastructures, important assets, and protective infrastructure.
