Urban heat island (UHI) effects are evident in many cities globally. Studies have revealed that UHI impacts air pollution and vice versa. However, it is observed that these two severe problems are addressed independently instead of interrelatedly. The study seeks to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between air pollution and heat and how they constantly shape urban areas for planning and future research purposes.  A global shift from sustainable planning practices to building urban resilience exists in line with this. This study delves further into identifying resilient approaches to combating UHI effects and air pollution. The systematic review of existing literature revealed a complex relationship between air pollution and urban heat islands. On one end, air pollution contributes to the heating of urban areas. Similarly, urban heat island effects have an impact on air quality. These two threats appeared to be significant contributors to climate change. The study recommends that adopting resilient planning practices could play a vital role in mitigating these problems. The whole idea of resilience is to plan so that crises are anticipated, planned, and accounted for. This can be done by addressing the root causes of these problems since they are interrelated through adaptive planning, governance, and management.
