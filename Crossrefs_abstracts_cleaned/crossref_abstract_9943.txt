 Cementitious stabilization of granular soils has been proven to be a cost-saving option for the use of materials with marginal quality in the construction and rehabilitation of pavement structures. The orthogonal load distribution capacity of the Cement-Stabilized Materials (CSM) is typically characterized by Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Indirect Tensile Strength (IDT), and Resilient Modulus (Mr) tests in the laboratory. The aforementioned parameters and properties are integral components of the analysis and design of pavements with stabilized layers. Time and budget constraints make it impractical for many state agencies to complete the full laboratory characterization protocols to determine all the design input parameters. Therefore, in many cases, the design engineers opt out of laboratory testing and primarily rely on past experience and engineering judgments to assign design input parameters. Such an approach compromises the reliability of the pavement life predictions, and can potentially incur unforeseen costs to the traveling public. This study was designed to bridge this gap by developing a series of statistically robust relationships between the laboratory achived data to provide an estimate of the design input parameters. To accomplish this objective, 570 stabilized cylindrical specimens were prepared and subjected to UCS, IDT, and submaximal modulus tests at three strength ratio levels. Subsequently, the relationships between the IDT, UCS, and resilient modulus at small-strain and intermediate strain levels were developed in this study. Such relationships can serve as a valuable means for the estimation of the tensile and compressive strength of the CSM for pavement design.
