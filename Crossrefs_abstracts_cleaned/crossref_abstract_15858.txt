During the 2020/2021 academic year, the working conditions of students during online classes, the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and their correlations with resilience and sleep quality were examined on a sample of students from the University of Sarajevo (UNSA). The results of the research show that most students have satisfying working conditions from home, but also that a large number of them still feel fear and anxiety that something will happen to the internet connection or computer during online classes and exams. About 50% of students have increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, which are significantly in correlation with poorer sleep quality. Higher levels of resilience in students are correlated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress and better sleep quality. The level of student depression is a variable that is the best predictor in explaining the criterion variable quality of sleep.
