First-year undergraduate engineering students are exposed to numerous stressors, including high academic demands and adjusting to new social support networks. Positive adaptations through the use of personal resources e.g. resilience has been associated with improved well-being outcomes in literature. A sample of 8 first-year undergraduate engineering students was examined in terms of i) the prevalence of Eudaimonic Well-Being (EWB) and resilience and ii) the role of resilience on EWB. EWB was assessed using the Flourishing Scale and resilience was measured using the Brief Resilience Scale. Findings uncovered low prevalence of EWB and resilience in the study population. The means of both FS and BRS scores were found to be significantly lower in the study population, compared to findings from other empirical studies. No significant relationship was found between resilience and EWB. Areas for future research is discussed.
