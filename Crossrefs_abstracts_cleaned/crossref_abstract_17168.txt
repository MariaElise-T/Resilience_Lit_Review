Buildings allow satisfying several needs of society, although their construction and use imply significant energy consumption and pollutant emissions. In general, they experience temporary or permanent events that could affect the conditions of well-being, safety, and use of equipment in interior spaces from an energy perspective. It is expected that the building can respond to such events by its design features (passive response) or by its systems (active response), which is studied from the energy resilience approach. However, there is little research on this topic. Therefore, this paper conducts a literature review covering definitions, assessment strategies, and case studies, particularly for the tropical zone, to identify and socialize the most relevant findings to facilitate future research.
