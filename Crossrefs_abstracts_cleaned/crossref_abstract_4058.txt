The objective of this research is to solve the problem of the lack of prediction methods and basis for the long-term road performance of oil shale residue-modified soil in seasonally frozen regions. This paper summarizes and expands the resilient modulus prediction methods in the related literature. Based on the measured soil–water characteristic curve (SWCC) of the compacted modified soil and the trend characteristics of dynamic resilient modulus under freeze–thaw cycles, a semi-empirical prediction model is proposed. This model was used to quantitatively forecast the resilient modulus of unsaturated modified subgrade soil after the freeze–thaw cycle in a seasonal permafrost region. The applicability and accuracy of the method were verified by dynamic resilient modulus tests of the oil shale residue-modified soil under various freeze–thaw cycles and moisture content. The results show that the model has a high degree of fit to the experimental data and is more suitable for predicting the dynamic resilient modulus of modified soil under the change of moisture and the freeze–thaw cycle compared to the existing models.
