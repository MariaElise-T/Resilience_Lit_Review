The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent pandemic have expedited the development of resilient supply chains. Digitization is increasingly acknowledged as a facilitative approach toward achieving that target. Researchers commonly acknowledge the necessity for more empirical studies to explore digitalization's potential to improve supply chain resilience and efficiency in unstable circumstances. This study proposes a theoretical framework that explains the influence of supply chain digitalization on the resilience of supply chains and performance. The proposed relationships were confirmed through a survey conducted with 315 construction companies in Pakistan. The findings provide insights into how digitization and supply chain resilience can enhance the efficiency of supply chain performance. Furthermore, the findings confirm resilience's partial positive mediating role in the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance. Supply chain digitalization can enhance cost-effectiveness, information, communication efficiency, and supply chain resilience, improving performance during crises. This study contributes to the existing research on supply chain digitalization and resilience by using dynamic capability to establish their association. The research findings offer valuable insights for companies to enhance supply chain resilience through digitalization.
