AbstractThis study aimed to design a program incorporating a narrative perspective that promotes resilience. A program was implemented that conveys an appreciation for the internal qualities of a familiar other person through the creation of a story about them. The experiment was conducted with 36 pairs of women; each pair had a “giver” and a “recipient.” The giver created a story that praised the “good points” of the recipient. There were significant increases in recipients' scores on measures of resilience, self‐esteem, and sense of acceptance of the giver. Additionally, the use of a story can help expand the interpretative ability of receiving and expressing praise.
