SummaryThis paper proposes a double‐node upset complete resilient (DNUCR) latch to meet the requirements of low orbit space applications for high robustness, cost‐effectiveness, and high performance. With the help of its interlocked loops with multiple feedbacks consisting of C‐elements (CE), input splitting CEs, 1P‐2N and 2P‐1N elements, and inverters, the proposed DNUCR latch preserves the original data even after the radiation incident. Error injection simulations in Synopsys HSPICE show that the proposed DNUCR latch recovers from all DNUs and can withstand large amount of injected charge. The simulation outcomes further show that the proposed DNUCR latch outperforms existing DNU‐resilient latches in terms of delay, power consumption, and power–delay–area product (PDAP), with an average of 48% reduction in delay, 22% savings in power, and 60% reduction in PDAP. The proposed DNUCR latch is also found to be the best among the existing radiation‐hardened latches in terms of charge‐to‐PDAP ratio.
