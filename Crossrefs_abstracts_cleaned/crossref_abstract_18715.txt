The background of this study is that the unsatisfactory studentâ€™s gradeÂ  on mathematical reasoning ability (MRA) tasks.Â  Even though MRA is an ability that needs to be possessed by high school students. To overcome this problem, we carried out an experiment for improvingÂ  students' MRA and mathematical resiliency (MR) through Inductive -deductive approach (IDA) and based on studentâ€™s cognitive stage (CS). The research involved 68 eleventh grade students with 16.5 years old from a high school in Bandung Indonesia. The instruments of this study were the MRA, TOLT and MR scale. The study found that as many as 29.4% student were at concreteÂ  stage, 51.5 % at transition stage, andÂ  19.1% at formal stage.Â  Overall and based on studentâ€™s cognitive stage, the study found that the grades of MRA and MR of students who obtained IDA were better than the grades of students who taught byÂ  discovery learning approach (DLA). Based on students' cognitive stages, there was no difference grades of MRA and MR in the two teaching approaches. Beside that, study found that there were no interaction between teaching approaches and cognitive stage on studentâ€™s MRAand MR andÂ  the IDA tookÂ  higherÂ  role than the cognitive stage on obtaining studentâ€™s MRA,Â  and MR.Â  It was also found that students taught by DLA experienced more difficulty in completing MRA tasks. Beside that,Â  there was moderateÂ  association betweenÂ  MRA, and MR, but there were no association between MRA and CS and between MR and CS.Â  In addition, students performed active learningÂ  during the IDA lessons such as to discuss acitvely, to solve problems enthutiastically, and to present their work in front of the class voluntary
