Due to the changes in the domestic and international economic situation in the post-pandemic era, the economic development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has become unstable in many aspects. The paper adopted the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model to build a regional economic resilience evaluation system from the perspective of public health emergencies. Then, the spatial and temporal evolution of the economic resilience of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the influencing factors were explored by using entropy weight method, GIS and gray correlation method. The conclusions show that: (1) Temporally, the economic resilience of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has generally increased from 2010 to 2021, and is divided into three main stages: rapid development, adjustment to fluctuations and stable development. (2) Spatially, the overall pattern of economic resilience in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is high in the middle and south and low in the northwest, and shows a “stochastic—equalized—polarized” pattern of transformation. (3) In terms of influencing factors, economic status and economic response are the main dimensions affecting the resilience level of the economic system in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao region. The level of scientific research and innovation, medical governance, government regulation and the rationalization of the industrial system are the key factors.
