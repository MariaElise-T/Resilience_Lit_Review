Abstract  Introduction Resilience is a commonly discussed term describing the ability to overcome, adapt to, or cope with stressful/disruptive events. Although researchers and practitioners define resilience in diverse ways – e.g., psychological or disaster resilience – the concept fundamentally encompasses perseverance through adversity. As experts in the interplay between individuals, environments, and occupations, occupational therapists and occupational scientists have great potential to understand and enable resilience, with some similar concepts appearing in occupational theories (e.g., occupational adaptation). However, there are no published reviews of resilience in the occupation-focused literature.  Objective We will explore how resilience is conceptualized and operationalized in the occupational therapy and occupational science research literature.  Method Guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology, we will search library databases and other sources for relevant records. Two team members will screen records for inclusion, with discrepancies settled by a third person. We will include English-language literature (including research papers, editorials, dissertations, etc.) published since 1990 which 1) contains the word root ‘resilien*’ and 2) is occupation focused, according to our criteria (occupational therapist/occupational scientist co-authors or research participants; and/or published in occupation-focused periodical). We will report key information of included literature, such as methodology and resilience theories discussed.  Results Our study is ongoing at the time of publication; this manuscript reports its protocol without results.  Conclusion Findings will be useful for clinicians and researchers looking for occupational conceptualizations of resilience. From a social justice perspective, our review may highlight evidence that occupational engagement can foster resilience among marginalized communities.
