The Resilience Sacale for Adults, Family Cohesion sub-dimension and Juhnke-Balkin Life Balance Inventory Quality of Relationships (r= -0.182, p=0.024); a low negative correlation was found between the sub-dimensions of Positive Orientation (r=-0.170, p=0.035) and Friendship (r=-0.170, p=0.034). There was a low level of positive correlation between the Resilience Scale for Adults's, Self-Perception sub-dimension and the Juhnke-Balkin Life Balance Inventory Career/Occupation (r=0.239, p=0.003) and Sleep Difficulty (r=0.231, p=0.004) sub-dimensions. A low level of positive correlation was determined between the Social Resources sub-dimension of the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Juhnke-Balkin Life Balance Inventory Positive Orientation (r=0.161, p=0.046) sub-dimension. A low level of negative correlation was found between the Resilience Scale for Adults Scale, Social Resources sub-dimension and the Juhnke-Balkin Life Balance Inventory Sleep Difficulty (r=-0.212, p=0.008) sub-dimension. The psychological resilience levels of the nurses are above the average.
