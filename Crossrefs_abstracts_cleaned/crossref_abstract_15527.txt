This paper focuses on the role resilience plays in flood crisis management at the municipal level. Drawing from crisis management and the resilience literature, we outline a conceptual framework for crisis management that incorporates resilience abilities, namely the ability to respond, monitor, anticipate, and learn. Then, through an in‚Äêdepth analysis of a flood event, provoked by the Synne storm in Norway in 2015, we explore the extent to which Eigersund municipality succeeded in managing the flood. We conclude by outlining the importance of resilience abilities to cope with learning and coordination challenges and by proposing further research endeavors.
