 ABSTRACT: Youth in foster care often experience abuse, disrupted attachment, social ostracization, and challenges in developing belonging and social interest. Some fostered youths are resilient, but the prevalence and impact factors of resilience are unknown. This meta-analysis includes studies ( k = 89; N = 121,869) with participants aged 0–19 years from demographically diverse regions worldwide. The prevalence rate (event rate, i.e., the proportion of the sample assessed as resilient; ER) for aggregated resilience (behavioral and psychological resilience combined) was 0.61 ( k = 89; 95% CI 0.56–0.66; p < .001). Male sex and race were significant risk factors. Those aged 7–11 years had the lowest resilience ERs (combined = 0.58 vs. 0.63), suggesting developmental impacts and mistaken lifestyles (i.e., mistakes in the chosen way to approach tasks and problems; Adler, 1931) reinforced in school. Interventions must accommodate different sexes, ages, and races and should incorporate Adlerian principles (e.g., encouragement, understanding mistaken beliefs, social embeddedness, motivations). Developmental and trauma-informed policies are needed.
