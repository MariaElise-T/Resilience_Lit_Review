Because of the resilient frame structure, the factor graph is often used in navigation systems to solve the sensor asynchrony problem and realize plug-and-play effectively in the navigation information fusion method. To improve the fault detection performance of resilient integrated navigation systems under complex interference environments, a fault detection method in factor graph navigation framework based on INS measurements and GNSS pseudo-range measurements is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can effectively locate the fault satellite pseudo-range information based on the Chi-square fault detection method. Due to the plug-and-play characteristic of the factor graph framework, this method can quickly isolate faults to improve navigation accuracy. Finally, the effect of the method is verified by simulation and experiment. Compared with the Chi-square fault detection method, positioning accuracy is improved by more than 40%.
