Data were collected from 289 undergraduate college students at a minority‚Äêserving institution to explore the impact of academic rational beliefs on grit and resilience. Findings from hierarchical regression analyses suggested that academic rational beliefs related to evaluation and work habits accounted for a significant amount of variance in grit. Work habits explained a significant portion of the variance in resilience. On the basis of these results, recommendations for future research and implications for college counselors are offered.
