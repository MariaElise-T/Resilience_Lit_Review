Purpose
 – Due to climate change and a considerable increase in man-made disasters, disaster risk management has gained a lot of importance. This article aims to summarize the proceedings of two days of discussion on natural and human-induced disasters organized by National Institute of Disaster Management at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. The objective is to evolve a holistic national strategy for inclusion of disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies and programs into the mainstream of developmental activities. The libraries worldwide are witnessing a series of disasters, and DRR is one of the much-discussed topics within the library community. The literature on disaster risk management in libraries is scanty, and with less research being done, needs urgent attention. The library conferences in India and abroad hardly address the theme “DRR”; therefore, this report will be of interest to librarians and policy makers for libraries. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – This report includes selected presentations and discussion during thematic and plenary sessions and provides a review of some of the events of the first session of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR). The author's observation/participation and discussion on vital areas, namely disaster resilience, capacity building, risk insurance, global warming and climate change, created insight in preparation of this report. 


Findings
 – A multi-stakeholder NPDRR has been constituted by the Government of India, with Home Minister as Chairman, in Resolution No. 47-31/2012-DM-III on 26 February 2013. The event was attended by various stakeholders such as policy makers, administrators, professional disaster managers, UN organizations, multilateral organizations, scientists, technocrats, academicians, corporate and private sectors, community leaders, representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions (grass roots-level institutions in India preferably called a “village panchayat”), and NGOs. India is amongst 80 countries which have a national platform on disaster risk management like the NPDRR. The theme generated a lot of discussion on risk financing mechanisms, long-term recovery and rehabilitation, and holistic strategy for multi-hazard DRR. 


Originality/value
 – This is an important topic in the area of disaster risk management which includes disaster resilience, capacity development, and policy planning. This discussion forum facilitated the enhancement of knowledge and the integration of DRR into the mainstream of development.
