Background: Kidney disease is a progressive, debilitating condition. Patients experience challenging physical and psychological symptoms and are at increased risk of anxiety, depression, and poor mental wellbeing. Access to specialist psychological or social support is limited, with inadequate provision of psychosocial support available across UK renal units. The COSMIC study (examining the acceptability and feasibility of the Compassionate Mindful Resilience programme for adult patients with chronic kidney disease) aimed to support a new service development project, in partnership with Kidney Care UK, by implementing the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, and explore its feasibility for patients with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease and kidney transplant recipients. This paper reports on the qualitative exploratory work which examined the experiences of study participants, their adherence to practice, and the acceptability of the intervention. Method: Participants (n = 19) took part in semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed, coded, and thematically analysed. Results: Three themes (and nine subthemes) were reported: experiences of the CMR programme that facilitated subjective benefit, participantsâ€™ lived and shared experiences, and the practicalities of CMR programme participation. All participants reported that they found taking part in the CMR programme to be a beneficial experience. Conclusion: The CMR programme was found to be an acceptable intervention for people living with kidney disease and provided tools and techniques that support the mental health and wellbeing of this patient group. Further qualitative exploration into participant experience should be integrated within future trials of this intervention.
