Single-stud walls (wood or steel) with resilient channel are commonly used to provide acoustic isolation for apartments and hotel rooms. In apartments, kitchen cabinets are often mounted on demising walls and/or corridor walls where resilient channel is also being used. In hotels, heavy items such as headboards, nightstands, and desks are often mounted to the demising walls. It is often impossible to entirely avoid mounting items on the side of the wall with resilient channels. Commonly, contractors will attach plywood directly to the studs between the resilient channel to fill the void created by the resilient channel, and the cabinets or other heavy items are screwed through the gypsum board and into the plywood, completely short-circuiting the isolation provided by the resilient channel. This presentation provides laboratory test results showing the detrimental effects of this mounting method. The presentation also introduces a new method of mounting cabinets (and other heavy items) that maintains the acoustic isolation of the resilient channel. Laboratory test results for the new mounting method are included and they show that the overall acoustic performance (STC rating) of the wall is maintained when cabinets are mounted.
