AbstractAimsThis study aimed to establish a cross‐cultural adaptation of the Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit (CART) assessment survey for Korean communities (K‐CART) and evaluated its psychometric properties of K‐CART.DesignA cross‐sectional study design was used.MethodsA forward and backward translation of the CART was conducted. The psychometric properties of K‐CART were evaluated with test–retest reliability, internal consistency, content validity and construct validity. A field study was conducted involving 315 older adults in Pohang city, South Korea from January to March, 2019. Two versions of K‐CART were analysed, based on the four‐factor and the expanded five‐factor K‐CART.ResultsThe test–retest reliability and internal consistency were acceptable (intraclass consistency coefficient = .90). The consistency reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach's α = 0.91). The content validity index (CVI) was found to be acceptable; wherein the item‐CVI and scale‐CVI were both 0.95. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the construct validity of the expanded K‐CART with five factors reached a more acceptable model fit (χ2/df = 2.27, CFI = 0.89, TLI = 0.86, RMESA = 0.05).
