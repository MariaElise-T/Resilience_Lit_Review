Background: Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a trauma that creates havoc in the personal and social lives of CSA survivors. The survivors in Kerala, India, struggle amidst the cultural background that silences CSA. Rehabilitation efforts in the state are channelized through government-run shelter homes that serve as the second home for CSA survivors. Aim: This study aims to examine the role of emotional health and sociodemographic factors in predicting resilience among CSA survivors under institutional care in Kerala. Method: We used a correlational research design with purposive sampling. From shelter homes in Kerala, 267 female participants (age range: 10-18 years, mean age: 16 years) were recruited. A personal data sheet and an emotional health questionnaire (EHQ) were used to collect data. Spearman rank correlation coefficient, linear regression, Kruskal–Wallis H test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Dunn’s post hoc test were used to analyze data. Results: Positive relationships among the emotional health variables namely aggression, anxiety, and depression were found, whereas a negative relationship existed between these variables and resilience. Further analyses found that the emotional health variables significantly predicted the resilience among survivors of CSA. In addition, there exists significant differences in resilience based on sociodemographic variables, such as age, duration of stay, and friendships, but resilience did not vary based on the religion and birthplace of survivors. Conclusion: Results suggest that participants experience moderate levels of emotional distress. Provision for integrated psychological support is recommended in the present rehabilitation process in Kerala. The mentoring relationships developed in the institutions are found to be instrumental in building confidence and hope in the participants, which is reflected in the trends in their resilience scores.
