 This paper aims to analyse the vulnerability to multidimensional poverty in Tunisia using a dual cut-off identification method and the fuzzy sets approach to estimate the degree of resilience for each household identified vulnerable. The results obtained allowed us to understand the sources of vulnerability in the different Tunisian regions. There is clear evidence that the number of vulnerable households grows as the degree of vulnerability increases and the size of vulnerable groups depends on the source of deprivation. Individuals with a high degree of membership are in a state of extreme vulnerability, and their abilities to cope with shock effects are low; they are exposed to the risk of experiencing poverty in the future. Preventive policies must consider their situations in order to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions.  JEL Classification: C1, D6, I3
