Abstract
Alcohol education must ensure that young people have appropriate information, motivation and skills. This article describes the fifth phase in a program of intervention development based on principles of social marketing and intervention mapping. The aim was to enhance drink refusal self-efficacy (DRSE) and help develop skills for non-drinking or moderate drinking. We conducted a mixed-methods feasibility trial that measured intervention effects among 277 UK secondary school students aged 14–16, and used qualitative methods to explore four teachers’ experiences of delivering the intervention. The intervention did not produce the desired changes in DRSE or alcohol use, but nor did it increase alcohol use. In the qualitative process evaluation, time constraints, pressure to prioritize other topics, awkwardness and embarrassment were identified as barriers to fidelitous delivery. A more intense and/or more prolonged intervention delivered with greater fidelity may have produced the desired changes in DRSE and alcohol use. This study illustrates how principles of social marketing and intervention mapping can aid development of resilience-based education designed to help students develop skills to drink moderately, or not drink. It also highlights the need to consider the constraints of micro-social (school) and macro-social (societal) cultures when designing alcohol education.
