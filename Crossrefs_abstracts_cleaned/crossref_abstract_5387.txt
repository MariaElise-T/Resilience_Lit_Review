Abstract
More often sensor and the data analytical tools are established for human biomedical applications before it finds ways in solving farm animal problems. Resilience is a type of toughness or resistance against degrading forces and the capacity to recover or endure from potentially harmful dynamics. For moment-by-moment quantification of the individual farm animalâ€™s cardiovascular functioning, physiological functioning indices sensor-based data becomes paramount. With much emphasis being given currently on the animal welfare, especially the cognitive, emotional, and psychological aspects of livestock, creating scientifically meaningful information from the sensor data becomes important. In this invited talk, I will be sharing results on measuring emotions, evaluating the indicators of resilience in farm animals, and developing solutions for livestock digital phenotyping through data analytics. I will walk you through some examples of how the data analytics was handled, and sensor-based data were collected, assimilated, integrated, and the insights were developed based on machine learning approaches.
