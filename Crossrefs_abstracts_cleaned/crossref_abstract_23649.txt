AbstractThe main aim of this study is two‐fold. First, we examine the combined effect of small‐and medium‐sized enterprises' (SMEs) adaptability, government support and information technology capability in business resilience. Second, we study the mediating effect of information technology capability on the proposed direct relationships. A total of 211 SMEs participated in this survey voluntarily. The proposed model and hypotheses were tested using variance‐based structural equation modelling. The findings disclosed that SMEs’ adaptability and information technology capability are positively related to business resilience. In terms of government support, it is not significantly related to SMEs’ business resilience, while a mediation result is uncovered between government support and business resilience. Additionally, the results revealed that information technology capability mediates the relationship between adaptability and business resilience. Based on the theoretical implications of the existing literature on the SMEs’ business resilience, this study also provides several useful managerial implications for business resilience enhancement.
