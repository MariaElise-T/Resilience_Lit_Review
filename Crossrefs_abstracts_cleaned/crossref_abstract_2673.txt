ABSTRACT  Objective: to translate, culturally adapt and validate the Multidimensional Individual and Interpersonal Resilience Measure to Brazilian Portuguese.  Method: after initial translation, the pre-final version underwent rigorous cultural adaptation procedures. As a result, the final adapted version was submitted to a validity study.  Results: adaptation procedures provided equivalence between the pre-final and the original versions in semantic, idiomatic, experiential and conceptual terms. A total of 187 older adults were included in the validity study. Exploratory factorial analysis (EFA) generated a model of five factors ((RMSEA = 0.030; TLI = 0.959; X2 = 151.590 p> 0.05). Final version showed adequate consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.705) and test-retest reliability (ICC=0.835). No statistically significant correlation was found between resilience and sociodemographic and epidemiological variables assessed in this study.  Conclusion: EMRII-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring resilience in Brazilian older adults.
