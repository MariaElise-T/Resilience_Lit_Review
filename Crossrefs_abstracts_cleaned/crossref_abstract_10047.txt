AbstractResearch consistently demonstrates resilience as an interactive process, drawing on personal assets together with relational and contextual resources, to support improved outcomes in contexts of nonnormative adversity. What remains unclear are the dynamics of this process and what drives it. This article draws on a prior scoping review of the literature to conceptually explore the positioning of the individual within this dynamic interplay of risks, resilience, and sociocultural context as it pertains to child and youth mental health. The paper begins by summarizing findings from this scoping review, highlighting core resilience elements and processes. These are then considered in relational to the global meaning theory, situating meaning‚Äêmaking as a key mechanism that mediates the interaction between individuals and their ecologies. Drawing on the literature, this article considers how this interaction shapes the particular ways in which resilience then manifests itself in the lives of individuals and becomes available as a resource to assist in the promotion of mental health.
