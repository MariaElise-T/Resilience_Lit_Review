Food is an essential requirement for humans in carrying out their lives. Indonesia is an agrarian country, but in reality, food security is apparently still very fragile. The evidence is evident from the large number of people's food imported from abroad. There is still a lot of wrong food management which causes Indonesia to not have food sovereignty. This study aims to examine the verses of the al-Qurâ€™an which analyze economic resilience by taking idea from Muslim figures, namely Muhammad Abid Al-Jabiri. This study uses qualitative method with documentation techniques, namely recording, collecting and recording all found data in documents. This study focused on searching various literature and manuscripts, both primary and secondary, which are closely related to the theme to be discussed. This research also uses analytical-descriptive method where this method is used to get an in-depth picture of the interpretation of the verses on resilience from Muhammad Abid Al-Jabiri's perspective. The results of this research are that Al-Jabiri's economic resilience strategy can be implemented in the form of practical policies such as those in the food productivity resilience sector implemented by mapping economic areas.
