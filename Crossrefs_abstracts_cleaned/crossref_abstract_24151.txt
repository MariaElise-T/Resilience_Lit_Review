During the COVID-19 pandemic, China has achieved high recovery efficiency. One of the most important reasons behind this is the effective poli­cies of promoting work resumption. Why can such policies maintain steady performance despite the high level of environmental uncertainties? This ques­tion can be answered from the perspective of policy resilience. This study employed a policy evaluation model for analyzing quantitative data of 342 poli­cies of promoting work resumption. We evaluate the policies through the Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC-index) model and text mining methods. The results show that: first, the contents and elements of all policies have consistent characteristics, including the combination of multiple policy tools, the combi­nation of support for work resumption and pandem­ic control, the incentives to support effective policy implementation, and the reasonable match between macro and micro policies as well as short-term and long-term policies. Second, among the nine policies that are randomly selected from the sample, one is rated excellent and the other eight are good, indicat­ing that China’s policies of promoting work resump­tion have good resilience.
