The growth of renewable energy generation in the power grid brings attention to high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission as a valuable solution for stabilizing the system. Robust hybrid power system state estimation could enhance the resilience of the control of these systems. This paper proposes a two-stage, highly robust least-trimmed squares (LTS)-based estimator. The first step combines the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements using the robust LTS-based estimator. The second step merges the obtained state results with the available phasor measurement units (PMUs) measurements using a robust Huber M-estimator. The proposed robust LTS-based estimator shows good performance in the presence of Gaussian measurement noise. The proposed estimator is shown to resist and correct the effect of false data injection (FDI) attacks and random errors on the measurement vector and the Jacobian matrix. The state estimation (SE) is executed on a modified version of the CIGRE bipole LCC-HVDC benchmark model integrated into the IEEE 12-bus AC dynamic test system. The obtained simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed two-stage LTS-based SE.
