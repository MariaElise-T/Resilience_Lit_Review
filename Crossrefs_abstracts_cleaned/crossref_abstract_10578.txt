Abstract This study aimed to identify cognitive (reasoning and executive functions) and resilient behavioral variables of (im)migrant university students which are related to different aspects on their adaptation to academic experiences. It is a descriptive exploratory cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 64 undergraduate and graduate students from three universities of Porto Alegre, with average age 23.75 years old (DP = 2.9), from other Brazilian state or other country. The results pointed that significant predictors of all five academic experiences’ dimensions were resilience’s aspects and none cognitive. Among these resilience’s aspects, it was highlighted Structured style, which predicted three different dimensions. Those findings show the relevant role of resilience in adaptive process faced by this population and, consequently, in their academic success.
