In this paper, we present an experimental approach to evaluate the sound transmission through floors and building structures. This method is developed in our laboratory at the National Center of Studies and Integrated Research of Building Engineering, CNERIB, Algeria. The method is based on measurement of sound due to impact vibration generated by a standard tapping machine placed on the upper surface of a small concrete floor. This floor has dimensions of 1.2(m)×0.8(m)×0.2(m) and simply supported on four elastic supports with 2 cm of rubber layer. The natural frequency of the floor is measured with an ambient vibration apparatus, and the obtained value is f = 19 Hz. The measurement consists of recording vibration levels in the upper and lower surfaces of the floor, in 1/3 octave frequency bands between 16 Hz and 16 KHz using piezoelectric accelerometer Brüel and Kjær 4508. The sound level meter Brüel and Kjær 2270 has been used to analyze the vibration signal for different cases. The weighted sound reduction index of the floor has 4 dB without any cover. Some samples of cover floor are tested using this procedure. The results show that the weighted sound reduction index of resilient layer can reach 18 dB, 11.6 dB and 6.6 dB for the rubber, Bitumen and PVC material, respectively. The important results obtained in this paper can be used as a platform to correct the impact sound insulation in multi-storey residential building and renovation plans using recycled resilient materials.
