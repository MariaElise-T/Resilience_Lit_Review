The informal sector is instrumental in the economic structure of a country. It is associated with a high population as well as increased demand for products sold within this sector. Unfortunately, its inability to remain resilient amidst the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the sector. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of business resilience on demand stimulation in the informal sector in Anambra State. The study identified risk assessment as an aspect of business resilient measures which involves three processes: risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation. The above-listed resilient measures demand high financial commitment which most times these informal sector businesses cannot afford. This affected the informal businessâ€™ ability to withstand the pandemic shock. The paper, therefore, recommended the provision of credit to firms in this sector to keep them alive and ensure demand stimulation of their products. It also recommended capacity building and strengthening in both institutional and individual spheres to keep businesses in this sector afloat in the event of a disruption.
