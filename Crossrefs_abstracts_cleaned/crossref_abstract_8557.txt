Smart microgrids are rapidly being developed and deployed, even as concerns over their cyber-physical security are increasing. The high penetration of these power electronic-interfaced energy resources has resulted in weaker power grids and an increase in cyberattack surface. The implementation of frequency regulation in these new resources—particularly in wind generators—is on the rise. This article investigates how malicious controllable loads can threaten the integrity of frequency-regulating wind generators. Adopting a user-centric approach and benefiting from small-signal analyses, the article shows for the first time how these wind generators can be the target of attackers. Effective methods to enhance system resilience are sought by mitigating the attack risk in the extended end-users, wind generators. The article models and explores how proper tuning and design of the physical system can improve cyber-physical security. The work also extends the user-centric method to the physical layer of smart grids. Detailed time-domain simulations verify the results of the analyses.
