The New Normal Era needs future adaptation, in order to ensure cities still
   have competitiveness and resilience in the tourism sector during the
   pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the implementation of the
   Smart Tourism Branding concept in Bantul city, Indonesia, during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This is a quantitative study, using the random sampling
   method to obtain data from 230 respondents through a questionnaire, which
   was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
   During the initial stage, a statistical test on each question?s validity and
   reliability in the questionnaire was conducted, after which data analysis
   was carried out. Before performing multiple linear regression analysis,
   several assumptions were fulfilled, including data normality and
   multicollinearity. The results showed that the evaluation of smart tourism
   branding provides an overview of people?s understanding and satisfaction
   level with regard to tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Jelajah
   Bantul application, which is a smart tourism branding instrument, supports
   Bantul City?s ability to compete in attracting tourists and investment
   globally. In addition, the city?s tourism management and branding identity
   can be facilitated and strengthened when the synergy strategy of the
   community and city stakeholders is appropriately regulated.
