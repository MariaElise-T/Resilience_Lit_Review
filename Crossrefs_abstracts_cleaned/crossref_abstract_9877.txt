This paper analyses territorial resilience in rural Andalusia, Spain, after the impact of the recent economic crisis and identifies the factors associated with the highest recovery rates in different contexts and territories. To this end, we developed a methodology that incorporates the heterogeneity and diversity of rural territories and uses composite indices calculated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in order to measure levels of resilience and identify the factors that impact recovery in rural counties. The results reveal how different aspects of economic, social, human, and natural capital promote resilient territorial dynamics in rural Andalusia. These results provide useful information for political decision-makers in the design of public policies, especially at a time like the present when the EU is immersed in debate on the reform of rural development policies for the next programming period beyond 2020.
