 The author develops a conceptual framework that defines characteristics of critically conscious institutions and proposes their effectiveness in the promotion and strengthening of resilience in black students. Black students’ development within an anti-black society is framed as a sustained and continuous adversity, and this article expands the critical consciousness conversation by shifting the focus from changes in student characteristics to institutional change, mirroring the shift in resilience literature from a critique of individuals’ characteristics to a critique of the interactions between individuals and the proximal and distal environments with which they engage.
