Abstract
The impact of climate change has caused flooding in the North Coast of Central Java Province. The level of flood hazard in 14 urban/municipalities on the North Coast of Central Java is all in the high category. The potential population exposed to flooding in this area reaches around 11,589,000 people, where a third are vulnerable groups (the poor). The impact of the flood disaster has caused environmental damage as well as physical and economic losses. This article aims to examine strategies to increase the resilience of the North Coast of Central Java using the Socio-Ecological System (SES) approach, where there is a reciprocal relationship between aspects of nature/environment (Natural System) and socio-economic (Socio-Economic Systems). Given that vulnerability (V) in the Pantura area of Central Java is dominated by many poor people and vulnerable groups, the strategy that needs to be done to reduce vulnerability is through poverty alleviation programs. To reduce the level of exposure (E) in the form of large physical and economic losses, it is necessary to provide the urban infrastructure that ensures the sustainability of the socio-economic activity system can take place properly. In addition, it is also necessary to control land use change because this has reduced the capacity and storage capacity of water, as well as prevented flooding. Finally, to overcome environmental damage, it is necessary to carry out an environmental conservation program on the North Coast of Central Java in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.
