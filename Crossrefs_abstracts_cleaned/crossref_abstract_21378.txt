Due to climate change and urban expansion, Seoul and Pohang have suffered unprecedented floods, and 30% of Pakistan's land has been inundated. As the locations and types of abnormal climates have diversified, the concept of resilience, which acknowledges the uncertainty of disaster prediction and encompasses the entire process from pre-disaster to recovery, has emerged as a new paradigm for disaster prevention. However, to use the concept of resilience for disaster prevention in cities, resilience should be measured first; however, research on measuring resilience remains a challenge. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for measuring resilience using resilience indicators. Nineteen indicators were classified into four dimensions, and a regional resilience index was derived using the entropy weighting method. The relationship between resilience and flood damage based on rainfall intensity was then analyzed.
