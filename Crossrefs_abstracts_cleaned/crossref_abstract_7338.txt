This article reflects on a creative group work with LGBTQ youth attending a LGBTQ support youth group in a South London borough. Community music was used as an expressive mode for facilitating exploration of key themes of interest to the participants and the project was co-designed as an emergent practice. As part of a reflective practice, the resilience framework was applied post-project, as a new way to reflect on the possibilities that such an activity might offer towards promoting resilience in LGBTQ young people. Both the process and content of the young peopleâ€™s lyrics are discussed. The Resilience Framework has potential to be a valuable planning tool for future LGBTQ music youth work.
