The present study examined the relationship between family functioning and resilience on the psychological well-being (PWB) in high school students. A cross-sectional study was conducted using multiple linear regression for prediction and descriptive statistical analysis in five Indonesian high school students. A total of 341 high school students participated in the study, completing three validated self-administered questionnaires. Statistical analysis revealed that greater family functioning was associated with higher PWB. A significant relationship between resilience and PWB was found in this cohort. This study showed that to maintain healthy mental well-being, developing resilience and family functioning is vital for high school students. More emphasis may be placed on the possible role of resilience training and other kinds of family functioning and coping strategies in dealing with the unavoidable causes of stress in public high schoolers.
