 The failure rate of innovation projects is substantial. Even innovation projects that fare well are sometimes terminated before completion. However, given the importance of innovator passion and commitment to innovative endeavors for successful innovation, such terminations pose the clear and present danger of negatively affecting subsequent innovation projects. Therefore, it is a key leadership task in the innovation arena to maintain innovator passion for their endeavors despite such setbacks. Our research indicates that authentic leadership is likely to bolster innovator resilience potential in order to minimize the human cost of innovation project terminations.
