 This paper describes the approach and the results of an ongoing research effort to assess the resilience of port operations following major disasters and other disruptive events. The work presented in this paper used archival data from the U.S. Coast Guardâ€™s nationwide automatic identification system to quantify the state of resiliency of coastal navigation systems. Illustrating the experimental methodology are case study examples that assess the disruptions that resulted from a collision in March 2014 in the Houston Ship Channel, Texas, and from Superstorm Sandy in 2012 on the greater Port of New York and New Jersey. The methods and results can be adapted and implemented for quantitatively evaluating levels of port activity following disruptive events and for a better understanding of the factors that lead to more resilient maritime systems.
