Background: Pain resilience can protect cancer patients from emotional turmoil as a protective factor in adapting to chronic pain. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate cancer patients’ psychometric properties in the Persian version of the Pain Resilience Scale. Methods: This methodological study was conducted on 200 patients with cancer, who referred to the chemotherapy section of Imam Reza Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran in 2021 to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Ankawi Pain Resilience Scale. The subjects were selected through purposive sampling method based on inclusion criteria. Results: The results indicated that Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was obtained under the Behavioral Perseverance Scale (α = 0.86), Emotional/Cognitive Positive Thinking Scale (α = 0.93), and the whole Scale (α = 0.94). According to the exploratory factor analysis, this scale explained 65% of the variance of the pain resilience variable. The confirmatory factor analysis results confirmed that a two-factor model is a good fit for the data. Conclusion: According to the results, the pain resilience scale had an acceptable validity in people with cancer.
