Objective: This study explores the role of resilience in facilitating the integration of Colombian refugees in New Zealand. Due to the lack of research on this specific population in New Zealand, this study was conducted to address the gap in academic literature. Methodology: This study used ethnography and oral history as its methodological approaches, conducting 12 oral history interviews with the participants. Additionally, four participants presented written personal diaries, resulting in a total of 13 Colombian refugees participating in the study. Findings: The findings showed that resilience has been the key factor enabling Colombian refugees to achieve successful integration in New Zealand. Conclusion: This study demonstrates how resilience has been instrumental in empowering Colombian refugees to navigate and overcome the challenges of integration in the country, including lack of English proficiency, mental health problems, discrimination, and unemployment.
