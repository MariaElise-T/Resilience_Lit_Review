Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are at the forefront of combating the COVID-19 pandemic have faced significant psychosocial challenges. In this context, this study aimed to investigate burnout, hopelessness, coronaphobia, psychological resilience levels, and associated risk factors among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed as a cross-sectional study that was conducted from March 15 to August 15, 2021. A total of 432 HCWs were included in the study who are working in a tertiary central pandemic hospital. The rate of HCWs diagnosed with COVID-19 was 29.4%. It was found that HCWs experienced high levels of burnout, hopelessness, and coronaphobia. HCWs who have a history of psychiatric disease and who are doctors were at higher risk for burnout. It is noteworthy that more than one-third of HCWs (37.4%) reported moderate to severe levels of hopelessness. The levels of psychological resilience were higher in doctors and nurses. There was a significant positive correlation between burnout, hopelessness, and coronaphobia, and a significant negative correlation between psychological resilience and these variables. In conclusion, multidisciplinary approaches are needed to support the mental health of HCWs, providing psycho-educations, building psychological resilience, and providing the required institutional and psychosocial support.
