This case study made use of semistructured interviews and a social network map to explore how adolescents with cancer develop resilience during the cancer experience. Seven adolescents with cancer aged 11 to 18 years and their mothers participated in this research. Pattern-matching logic using a 4-stage Self-Sustaining Process Model was applied to arrive at a comparative analysis. Findings indicated that initially, 5 adolescents who were told of their cancer diagnoses moved through the process during the cancer experience. Also, in newly diagnosed adolescents and in those who experienced relapse, a slight difference was noticed in terms of their response to studies and their hope levels. Second, 2 adolescents who were told of their diagnoses indirectly did not experience a complete passage through the phases comprising the process. Finally, the adolescents received social support from their families, friends, and relatives. This study suggests that an understanding of individual and cultural differences is important to improve resilience in adolescents with cancer. Because of the small sample surveyed by this research, further studies are needed to validate these conclusions and develop appropriate nursing intervention techniques.
