AbstractRevolutionary changes of a VUCA-world are effecting more and more industries. Focusing the automotive industry, this is caused by several new trends in technology or market. This situation is requiring high flexibility and is questioning for sustainability as well as resilience in system development projects. This publication represents results out of a survey, part of a wider research. The objective is the development of a process orientated method for risk and technical change management. The survey is conducted by participants of transdisciplinary system development in automotive industry. Topics questioned are VUCA, complexity, (re-)action, quality and module interfaces of Generic Systems Engineering. The results demonstrate the participantsâ€™ experience and demands for sustainable and resilient system development projects. In conclusion, this report provides information on the considering elements to develop a process orientated method for risk and technical change management in automotive industry.
