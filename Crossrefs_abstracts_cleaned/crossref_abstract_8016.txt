An increasing body of research suggests job embeddedness (JE) as a motivational variable influencing employees’ attitudinal and behavioral outcomes such as quitting intentions and task performance. Personal resources have been reported to affect JE and these outcomes. However, little work has investigated the antecedents and consequences of JE among cabin attendants. There is also a dearth of empirical research regarding the mechanism linking resilience to cabin attendants’ affective and performance outcomes. Therefore, drawing on conservation of resources and JE theories, we propose a conceptual model that examines the interrelationships of resilience, JE, career satisfaction (CSAT), and creative performance (CPERF). Moreover, the model explores JE as a mediator of the impact of resilience on CSAT and CPERF. These linkages were tested via data collected from cabin attendants and their pursers. The findings from structural equation modeling reveal that resilience boosts cabin attendants’ JE, CSAT, and CPERF. As predicted, JE is a mediator between resilience and CSAT. Our paper culminates with implications for theory and practice as well as future research directions.
