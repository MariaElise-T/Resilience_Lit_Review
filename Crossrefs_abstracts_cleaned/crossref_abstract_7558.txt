Background: Student midwives face a number of challenges during their pre-registration programme, both academically and in clinical practice. Aims: This pilot study aimed to examine the role that resilience might play in supporting student midwives to continue on the midwifery undergraduate programme. Method: Five second-year student midwives volunteered to take part in the pilot. All five students completed Wagnild's updated True Resilience Scale (TRS), and partipated in a focus group and a one-to-one interview. Findings: One participant scored ‘moderate’ on the TRS, three ‘moderately high’ and one ‘high’. Six main themes emerged from the focus group and interviews: defining and recognising resilience; building and developing resilience through reflection; developing resilience through positive and negative encounters on the midwifery programme; the relevance of significant others; transferable resilience; and different styles of resilience. Conclusions: The pilot offered insights into the significance of resilience and student midwives that will contribute to the main study. This initial study has generated some findings that are reflected in the broader resilience literature. The characteristics of resilience were articulated and the data contained examples of a range of challenges and the role resilience might play. This pilot is to be followed up by a study that will follow one cohort over the first 18 months of the midwifery programme to get a longitudinal view of the midwifery students' resilience.
