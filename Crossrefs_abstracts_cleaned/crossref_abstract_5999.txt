 The PRE-EMPT project is a three-year project that has set out to improve the way buildings and infrastructure in the UK are planned, designed, built, managed and retrofitted to cope with natural and manmade threats. The PRE-EMPT toolkit is being designed to help embed resilience considerations at the most appropriate stage, into a wide range of critical infrastructure and built assets. The charrettes workshops that are being conducted as part of this project are being used to encourage a wide range of stakeholders. Engineers, architects, planners, designers, and developers have to proactively consider ways in which the built environment in the UK can better withstand, and adapt to the threats of events such as floods, storms and terrorist attacks.
