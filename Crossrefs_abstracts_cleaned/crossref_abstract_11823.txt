An understanding of what contributes to resilience in the adolescent cancer experience is important in caring for adolescents with cancer and childhood cancer survivors. The purpose of this article is to provide a synthesis of the literature related to resilience in the adolescent cancer experience. Research recommendations based on theoretical and methodological limitations noted in the review are presented.
