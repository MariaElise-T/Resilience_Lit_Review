AbstractBackgroundNurses are suffering from increasing stress, and nursing is recognized as one of the most stressful job. Their mental health problems are serious and worthy of attention.AimThe purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between resilience and mental health and general well‐being among nurses.MethodsA cross‐sectional survey was conducted in 2014, using a self‐reported questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete the measure of resilience, mental health, and general well‐being. The method of randomly cluster sampling was used to select nurses as participants. A survey of 365 nurses was conducted to test the hypothesized model.ResultsThis study showed that resilience, mental health, and general well‐being correlated with each other. General well‐being was an effective predictor of resilience and mental health, whereas it both can moderate and mediate the relationship.ConclusionsStrategies to increase nurses' general well‐being could enhance their resilience and reduce mental health problems. It is important to improve the mental health of nurses and maintain the professional values that ensure career sustainability.
