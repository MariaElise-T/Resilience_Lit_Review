In dynamic socio-economic environments, public sector organizations and companies with strong financial resilience are better equipped to adapt to economic changes, socio-economic fluctuations, and shifts in the business landscape with greater flexibility. Financial resilience also has implications for an organization's liquidity. One of the critical factors influencing financial resilience in public sector organizations is the quality of its audit. Ensuring high-quality audits is vital for assessing the accuracy and reliability of an organization's financial statements. This study aims to investigate the impact of audit quality and internal control on financial security, with information quality serving as a mediating factor. Quantitative research methods were employed to collect and statistically analyze the data. The study gathered information through questionnaires distributed to the Auditors of the Supreme Audit Board, with a sample size of 321 participants. The data was then processed using SmartPLS software. The research findings demonstrate a significant relationship between audit quality and internal control, positively influencing the organization’s financial resilience. Furthermore, the study reveals that information quality acts as a crucial mediator, linking audit quality and internal control to financial security. The analysis shows that audit quality significantly affects information quality. However, the direct impact of audit quality on financial resilience is not significant. On the other hand, internal control significantly influences both information quality and the organization’s financial resilience. Additionally, the quality of information also has a significant effect on the organization’s financial resilience.
