Abstract
Despite increasing automation levels and digital solutions, manufacturing process safety still very much rely on the inescapable contribution of the human factor. The changing relationship between man and automation system together with the increased complexity result in high risks for process safety. From time perspective, the resilience of a manufacturing system shows a curve divided into dimensions: adaptability, recovery and innovation. Perceptual stance, contextual integration and decision making and doing are made up of system resilience elements. As a socio-technical system, a human-automation manufacturing system may strengthen resilience by considering both technical and organizational sides.It is an effective approach to construct manufacturing system resilience by assigning the functions according to the task, the operator, and the situation considering the system dynamics.
