 Resilience is often operationalized as the presence of positive behaviors and the absence of negative behaviors without considering external factors (e.g., racial discrimination), potentially limiting oneâ€™s ability to control their outcomes. In a sample of 20 former foster youth, this study investigated internal and interpersonal resilience and betrayal trauma. A mixed-methods approach addressed two questions: (a) How resilient are former foster youth? and (b) Which factors examined correlate with resilience? I hypothesized that (1) resilience would positively correlate with emotion regulation and self-esteem and (2) negatively correlate with perceived stress, betrayal trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that (3) betrayal trauma would positively correlate with PTSD and (4) negatively correlate with emotion regulation. Results demonstrated no correlation between resilience and emotion regulation or self-esteem; negative correlations between resilience and perceived stress, betrayal trauma, and PTSD; and insignificant correlations between betrayal trauma and PTSD and emotion regulation.
