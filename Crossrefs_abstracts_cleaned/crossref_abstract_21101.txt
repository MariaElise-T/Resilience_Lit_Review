Along with the increase in large and medium-scale disasters in the world, including in Indonesia, in the last decade, many theories and practices have developed in terms of measuring and improving disaster resilience. This study discusses the conceptual model of community-level disaster resilience and disaster risk reduction. Using a basic conceptual model for spatial protection to geological hazard, research examines the role of community resilience in reducing risk by using social dimensions. To explore the conceptual model of spatial resilience at the community scale, case studies conducted in two disaster events, are (1) communities affected by landslides in Cisolok, Sukabumi District on 31 December, 2018 and (2) Sunda Strait tsunami in Pandeglang tourism area on 22 December, 2018. Research suggests that the importance of social capital in terms of forming community resilience is related to disaster risk reduction. Social network, social experience, social knowledge and belief systems, contribute to increasing resilience and disaster risk reduction. The results of this study are the importance of building social capital and spatial resilience of communities in reducing disaster risk.
