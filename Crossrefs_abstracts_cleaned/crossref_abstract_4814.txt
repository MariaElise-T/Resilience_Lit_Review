Abstract
Date Presented 03/26/20
This presentation introduces the concept of occupational resilience in occupational science. Drawing from study outcomes revealing enduring performance of music by refugees in challenging circumstances, authors posit that focusing on the talents, skills, and aspirations of individuals enables researchers to recognize successful performance of occupation amid challenges. To advance the debate regarding performance of occupations in problematic situations, occupational resilience is a vital new concept.
