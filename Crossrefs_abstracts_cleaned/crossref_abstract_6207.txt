This study attempts to test the relationship between professional stress tolerance and the productivity of university professors. The evaluation criteria used in this study are 1. Work Stress Questionnaire (JSQ) ofTÃ¶res, (1988), 2. Work Resilience Questionnaire (WRQ) of Winwood et al., (2013) and, 3. Work Performance Questionnaire (WPQ) of Koopmans, (2014). The regression analysis has been applied to predict the relationship among the research variables of this study. In addition, the t-test is also used to analyze the gender-based differences and differences in work stress and work resilience of university academicians. The results depicted at female university teachers faced more work stress compared to male university teachers, and male university teachers had a higher mean score regarding work resilience than female university teachers. Furthermore,obtained the results of the research explained that level of flexibility and supposed work efficiency are positively correlated. The significant prognosticator of work performance was occupational stress resilience. However,work performance was not predicted by work stress.
