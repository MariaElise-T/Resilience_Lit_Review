The primary focus of the NEBULA Future Internet Architecture is to provide resilient networking for the emerging cloud computing model. One of the attractions of cloud computing is its support for online services and data storage by thin clients such as mobile devices. This paper describes two components of NEBULA's edge network technology, Serval and CRYSTAL. Serval provides a new layer 3.5 service abstraction that naturally supports mobility, multi-homing, and multi-path transport, while CRYSTAL is a new virtualization scheme for software radios that makes it easier to expose greater network diversity at the network edge.
