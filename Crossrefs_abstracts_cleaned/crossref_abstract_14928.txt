Autonomy is also a coping method health professionals use to overcome challenges. The purpose is to examine the role of personal resilience and personality traits of health professionals in IPCP implementation in hospitals. A scoping review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines for a scoping review. The study was performed on six databases (PubMed, Clinical Key, ProQuest, EBSCO, Scopus, and Science Direct) for relevant papers published between 2017 and 2021. Search terms included "Resilience AND Personality, "Health Professionals", "Interprofessional Collaboration Practice", AND "Hospital." Eight articles were included in this review. The study showed that personal resilience and personality traits determined the success of IPCP implementation in the hospital, which was influenced by education, training, management support, and hospital facilities and infrastructure. Conclusion: The role of each health professional's personal resilience and personality traits affects the quality of IPCP implementation in the hospital. Recommendation: IPCP can improve the quality of service in hospitals by facilitating health professional knowledge and skills about interprofessional collaboration, especially in implementing case management in hospitals.
