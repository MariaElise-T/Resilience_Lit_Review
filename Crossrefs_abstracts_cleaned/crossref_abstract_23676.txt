AbstractIn the face of diverse challenges like global warming, ocean acidification, and human activities, the world's coral reefs are confronting a severe ecological crisis. Understanding the historical coevolution of corals with their environment and their resilience to current climate change is crucial for protecting these ecosystems and predicting their future. In this context, metal stable isotopes in corals present a novel and alternative methodology. Their significant fractionation during coral biological processes, persistent presence in coral skeletons, and relatively straightforward sources make them a valuable tool. However, the complexity of coral biology necessitates a deeper investigation into the fundamental mechanisms behind the isotopic fractionation of these biologically utilized metal elements. A comprehensive and systematic study of the roles of metal stable elements in coral biological processes is essential. This includes examining the fractionation of metal isotopes across different parts of the corals, such as tissues, zooxanthellae, and skeletons. To achieve these goals, multidisciplinary collaborations are essential. They should focus on several key areas: interpreting metal stable isotopes data in the context of coral physiology and ecology; conducting controlled laboratory experiments on coral cultivation; engaging in comparative studies with inorganically precipitated aragonites; and developing a holistic understanding within the framework of coral biomineralization models.
