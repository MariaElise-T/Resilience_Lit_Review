Exposure to violence is common in South Africa. Yet, few studies examine how violence exposure contributes to South African adolescents’ participation in youth violence. The aims of this study were to examine effects of different violence exposures on violent attitudes and behavior, to test whether attitudes mediated effects of violence exposures on violent behavior, and to test whether adult involvement had protective or promotive effects. Questionnaires were administered to 424 Zulu adolescents in township high schools around Durban, South Africa. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test associations among violence exposures and both violent attitudes and behavior. Victimization, witnessing violence, and friends’ violent behavior contributed directly to violent behavior. Only family conflict and friends’ violence influenced violent attitudes. Attitudes mediated effects of friends’ violence on violent behavior. Multiple-group SEM indicated that adult involvement fit a protective model of resilience. These findings are discussed regarding their implications for prevention.
