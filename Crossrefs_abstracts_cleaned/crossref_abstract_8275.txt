Academic motivation is an important construct for university students, associated with student wellbeing and academic performance. Students who are motivated tend to feel and perform well. Self-compassion, that is kindness and understanding towards oneself in difficult times, and resilience, an ability to bounce back from difficulties, are also associated with student wellbeing and academic achievement. However, how these variables are related to each other has not been evaluated in Indonesian university students. Indonesian higher education has rapidly developed, focusing on student achievement while their wellbeing suffers. Understanding how academic motivation is linked with self-compassion and resilience can inform an effective way to augment their motivation. Accordingly, this cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship among these three variables. An opportunity sample of 156 students in Indonesia completed measures about those three constructs. Correlation, regression and moderation analyses were used. Intrinsic motivation was positively associated with extrinsic motivation and resilience. Amotivation was negatively associated with self-compassion and resilience. Self-compassion was positively associated with resilience. Both self-compassion and resilience predicted all three types of motivation apart from self-compassion for intrinsic motivation. Lastly, self-compassion nor resilience moderated the pathway from extrinsic motivation to intrinsic motivation. Resilience interventions are recommended for Indonesian students to maintain intrinsic motivation. Our findings will help educators and wellbeing staff to identify helpful ways to support healthful motivation in this student population that is undergoing drastic changes.
