Recently we have witnessed an increasing demand of fault-tolerant communications in publish/subscribe middleware. Although several reliable solutions have been proposed, none of them address the problem of achieving resilient and timely event dissemination. We investigate how guaranteeing assured message dissemination despite occurrence of network faults without breaking temporal constraints. The contribution of this article is on devising a FEC approach where encoding functionality is placed at the root and on a subset of interior nodes in the multicast tree. Simulations-based experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach allows all the interested subscribers to receive all the published messages and the adopted resiliency mean does not affect the performance of the multicast protocol.
