BackgroundMechanisms for improving resiliency, and the potential benefits of doing so, are not well evidenced and understood. This research explored the relationship between mental health and resiliency, to broaden the perspectives of influ-ences on resiliency by controlling for mindfulness and self-compassion.Participants and procedureOne questionnaire comprised four pre-developed questions, examining mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress), resilience, mindfulness and self-compassion. Participants (N = 551) were recruited from the general public across the West and East Midlands of England.ResultsThe results showed that poor mental health was related negatively to resilience. Furthermore, the negative relation-ship of resiliency with mental health was mediated when controlling for mindfulness and self-compassion.ConclusionsMindfulness and compassion-based interventions have the potential to develop resiliency by influencing their rela-tionship with health. Future directions are discussed.
