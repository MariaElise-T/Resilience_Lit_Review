Background: Patients with rotator cuff disease commonly complain of difficulty sleeping. Arthroscopic repair has been associated with improved sleep quality in many patients with rotator cuff tears; however, some individuals continue to suffer from sleep disturbance postoperatively. Purpose: To determine whether changes in sleep quality following rotator cuff repair are predicted by a patient’s narcotic use or ability to cope with stress (resilience). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 48 patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were prospectively enrolled and completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) preoperatively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered preoperatively and at multiple intervals postoperatively for 6 months. Narcotic utilization was determined via a legal prescriber database. Pre- and postoperative sleep scores were compared using paired t tests and the McNemar test. Linear regression was used to determine whether narcotic use or CD-RISC score predicted changes in sleep quality. Results: An increased number of patients experienced good sleep at 6 months postoperatively ( P < .01). Mean ± SD nocturnal pain frequency improved from 2.5 ± 1.0 at baseline to 0.9 ± 1.1 at 6 months. CD-RISC score had a positive predictive value on changes in PSQI score ( R 2 = 0.09, P = .028) and nocturnal pain frequency ( R 2 = 0.08, P = .041) at 2 weeks. Narcotic use did not significantly predict changes in PSQI score or nocturnal pain frequency ( P > .05). Conclusion: Most patients with rotator cuff disease will experience improvement in sleep quality following arthroscopic repair. Patients demonstrated notable improvements in nocturnal pain frequency as soon as 6 weeks following surgery. CD-RISC resiliency scores had a significant positive predictive value on changes in sleep quality and nocturnal pain frequency at 2 weeks. Narcotic use was not associated with change in sleep quality.
