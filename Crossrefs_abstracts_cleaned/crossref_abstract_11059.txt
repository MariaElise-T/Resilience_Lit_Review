Abstract
The aim of this study was to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector in Europe, particularly on tourist spending on transport, accommodation, and restaurants. The data used in the study were sourced from Eurostat statistics for the years 2019 and 2021. As part of the research method, a cartodiagram was used to present the percentage changes in tourist spending in selected European countries. Additionally, an analysis of the percentage change in spending on transport, restaurants, and accommodation in 2021 compared to 2019 was conducted using the ggplot2 package implemented in the R programming language. The study results indicate a varied situation regarding declines in tourist spending in 2021 compared to 2019, with smaller decreases noted in Central European countries, suggesting greater resilience to the pandemic crisis. Despite the declines, Germany and France maintained the highest spending values in 2021, underscoring their key role in the European tourism market. Conclusions from the study suggest that tourism-related spending has a huge impact on the economy. A more thorough understanding of how tourists spend money during their travels, including during a pandemic, can help better tailor tourism offers to their needs. By implementing the recommendations in the article, countries can better prepare for future challenges, build more resilient tourism industries, and ensure sustainable growth in the postpandemic era.
