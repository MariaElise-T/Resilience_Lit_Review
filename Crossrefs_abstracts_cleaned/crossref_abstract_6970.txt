In this study, a moderated mediation analysis was conducted to assess
   whether psychological resilience mediates the association between loneliness
   and psychological distress and whether this association is moderated by
   social support or/and gender. So, three different two- and three-way
   moderated mediation models were tested. The study group of this research
   consists of 1251 participants from the general population of Turkey. It was
   determined that loneliness and psychological distress of the group receiving
   high social support decreased. Resilience shows a partial mediation in the
   relationship between loneliness and psychological distress. Besides, the
   relationship between loneliness and resilience is significant. Our study
   shows that one of the most important variables in reducing psychological
   distress, regardless of gender, is to reduce loneliness. This study showed
   that the psychological distress variable, which is one of the most important
   components in the evaluation of psychological well-being, is directly
   related to loneliness and resilience variables.
