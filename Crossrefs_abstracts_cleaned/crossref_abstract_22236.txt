AbstractResilience, commonly perceived as an unobservable household characteristic, has been defined differently according to each measurement approach utilized. This paper contributes to the literature, both conceptually, by reviewing the link between resilience, subjective well‐being and social inclusion; and analytically, by providing statistical evidence of whether subjective measures of well‐being are associated with higher household resilience. The paper shows that those who perceive themselves and their community to be involved in the decision‐making process related to policies and service provision are associated with greater resilience capacity. The empirical evidence is based on two household surveys in Senegal and Mauritania. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
