 Abstract: The Essential Resilience Scale (ERS) measures global trait resilience and three factors of physical, emotional, and social resilience. This study developed an Italian adaptation of the ERS and recruited participants from Italy ( N = 500) to complete the measure along with criterion validity measures of broad personality traits and related psychological concepts. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) demonstrated robust evidence for a well-fitting three-factor model of the ERS, with items strongly loading onto their respective latent factors. Utilizing Samejima’s graded response model, most item discrimination values were moderate-to-high, and category threshold parameters were well-distributed throughout the latent continuum. The ERS showed correlations in the expected directions with extraversion, emotionality, optimism, mastery, resilience, behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition, stress, and well-being. Cultural invariance was supported (at the scale- and item-level) with multigroup CFA and differential item functioning (DIF) with a sample of Canadian English speakers ( N = 874). Findings evinced the internal consistency (i.e., total MacDonald’s ω), factorial validity (i.e., three-factor CFA), criterion validity (i.e., personality, temperament), and convergent validity (i.e., trait resilience and well-being) of the Italian ERS. Results suggest the Italian ERS can be applied for measuring resilience for future research studies in Italian-speaking populations.
