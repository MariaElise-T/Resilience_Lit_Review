Resilience is a feature that is gaining more and more attention in computer science and computer engineering. However, the definition of resilience for the cyber landscape, especially embedded systems, is not yet clear. This paper discusses definitions provided by different authors, on different years and with different application areas the field of computer science/computer engineering. We identify the core statements that are more or less common to the majority of the definitions, and based on this we give a holistic definition using attributes for (cyber-) resilience. In order to pave a way towards resilience engineering, we discuss a theoretical model of the life cycle of a (cyber-) resilient system that consists of key actions presented in the literature. We adapt this model for embedded (cyber-) resilient systems.
