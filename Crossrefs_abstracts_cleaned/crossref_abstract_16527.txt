AbstractIntroductionMothers of children with haemophilia (CWH) experience guilt related to this genetic condition. Several factors contributing to maternal guilt have been identified, but the scope and extent of guilt have not previously been quantified.AimThis study provides insight into the experience of mothers of CWH and how they perceive and manage guilt. It then identifies the most common and helpful coping mechanisms.MethodsBetween May and October 2021, we distributed an anonymous electronic survey to mothers of CWH. The Parent Experience of Child Illness measured maternal guilt, the PROMIS Parent Proxy for Life Satisfaction measured perception of their child's life satisfaction and additional questions explored specific guilt factors and coping strategies.ResultsEighty‐seven mothers responded to the survey. Forty percent of mothers experienced increased guilt. The most common reasons for guilt included putting their child through pain during infusions and passing on the affected X chromosome. Perceived life satisfaction, increased age and genetic counselling were associated with less guilt. The most common coping strategies involved utilizing social support, self‐education and connecting with other mothers in the community.ConclusionSome mothers experienced increased feelings of guilt, illustrating the need for providers to tactfully provide anticipatory guidance and counselling. Tangible manifestations of haemophilia were more likely to trigger feelings of guilt than familial factors. Community immersion was beneficial, as other mothers in the community served as a source of social and educational support. Most mothers did not report guilt, illustrating the adaptability and resilience of the haemophilia community.
