Digital entrepreneurship can be a potential alternative solution for addressing challenges faced by young people and future workers in Asia. Additional studies are required to enhance comprehension of digital entrepreneurship given the insufficiency of research conducted in this domain. This research seeks to uncover possible determinants that could impact the desire to engage in digital entrepreneurship, with a specific focus on personal traits, resilience, and the level of educational services. The participants in this study are university students as they represent the potential future workforce and potential digital entrepreneurs. A total of 517 sample data (212 Malaysian, 305 Indonesian) were collected through online surveys towards students in Malaysia and Indonesia. The study used a brief version of The Big Five Personality Traits, CD-RISC resilience scale, Liñán & Chen entrepreneurship intention scale, and Parasuraman, Zheitaml, Berry SERVQUAL to gather data. To analyze the data, the study employed structural equation modeling. The results suggest that the intention to pursue digital entrepreneurship is affected by both an individual's openness to experience and their resilience. Additionally, the study revealed that service quality is a factor that affects both digital entrepreneurship intention and resilience. This study provides new understanding of digital entrepreneurship intention antecedents and implies that improvement on education quality service can foster student’s intention to digital entrepreneurship and their resilience.
