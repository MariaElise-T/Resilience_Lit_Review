The present study explores gender differences in adjustment issues, quality of life and psychological resilience among hostel students. Purposive sampling was used and 400 hostel students (female=183 and male=217) were taken from public and private sector colleges/universities. Students from 1st year, BS (year1) and MS (year1) with 18-25 years were taken. The College Adjustment Test CAT was translated in Urdu language and administered on the students along with PR, Short form survey (SF-36) and demographic form. Results show that reliability of the scales was found to be significant CAT α=0.72, SF-36 α=0.80 and PR α= 0.62. The first hypothesis showed significant result (p = 0.03) that 1st year students tend to face more adjustment issues rather than BS (year 1). The second hypothesis verified that female students encounter more adjustment problems as compared to male students. Male students show higher psychological resilience (PR) as compared to female students. While there are no gender differences found on the variable of QOL which was assessed through SF-36. PR showed negative correlation with adjustment issues r=-0.11and SF-36 r=0.20. This research will help university administrators, counselors and student affair officers to design appropriate policy/ programs with varieties of support packages to address the needs of the students.
