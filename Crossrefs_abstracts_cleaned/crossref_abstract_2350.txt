Infectious diseases and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have a huge economic impact on cities. However, few studies examine the economic resilience of small-scale regions within cities. Thus, this study derives neighborhoods with high economic resilience in a pandemic situation and reveals their urban characteristics. It evaluates economic resilience by analyzing changes in the amount of credit card payments in the neighborhood and classifying the types of neighborhoods therefrom. The study conducted the ANOVA, Kruskalâ€“Wallis, and post hoc tests to analyze the difference in urban characteristics between neighborhood types. Accordingly, three neighborhood types emerged from the analysis: high-resilient neighborhood, low-resilient neighborhood, and neighborhood that benefited from the pandemic. The high-resilient neighborhood is a low-density residential area where many elderly people live. Neighborhoods that benefited are residential areas mainly located in high-density apartments where many families of parents and children live. The low-resilient neighborhood is an area with many young people and small households, many studio-type small houses, and a high degree of land-use mix.
