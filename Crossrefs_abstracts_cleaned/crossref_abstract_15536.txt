Abstract:  The purpose of the study was to advance our understanding of resilience by studying multiple protective factors associated with positive adjustment among an ethnically diverse sample of 310 low‐income boys followed prospectively from ages 1.5 to 12 years, using neighborhood quality to define risk status. The results indicated that child and family protective factors measured in early childhood were all significantly associated with positive adjustment at 11 and 12 years of age. However, these results were qualified by risk level, such that parent–child relationship quality was only significantly related to positive outcomes in the context of low levels of risk.
