The impact of COVID-19 on mental health across the globe has been colossal. Student mental health and well- being during the pandemic has caused increasing concern due to the drastic transition to online classes, lowered opportunities for socialization and stress related to COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to explore the prevalence of mental fatigue among undergraduate medical students at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (COMHS), National University of Science and Technology, Sultanate of Oman and study the impact of resilience as a protective factor during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated that participants experienced mild levels of mental fatigue. Normal levels of resilience capacity were seen among medical students. Significant negative correlation was seen between Mental Fatigue and Resilience. Linear regression analysis indicated that gender was a moderate predictive factor in the experience of mental fatigue. Post-lockdown survey results indicated that medical students continued to experience signs of mental fatigue, though restrictions have eased. They also continued to exhibit normal levels of resilience capacity. Students at the COMHS experienced mild levels of mental fatigue during the pandemic lockdown period. Normal level of resilience capacity effectively contributed as an emotional protective factor. Medical students continue to experience mild levels of mental fatigue, though lockdown restrictions have eased. Enhancing campus-based counselling support services to target COVID-19 related psychological distress and improve resiliency capacity is vital.
