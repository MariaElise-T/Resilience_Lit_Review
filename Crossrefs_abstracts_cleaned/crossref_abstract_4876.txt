Problem: why are some technology entrepreneurship projects successfully, resilient and others not when they are executed in the same ecosystem? 

Research objectives: to revise conceptual and theoretical portraits of the process of technological entrepreneurship; propose a model that incorporates multidimensional factors that can effectively contribute to the success and resilience of technology entrepreneurship.

Methodology: we used the inductive approach and a qualitative exploratory strategy. Private and public companies are our sample for convenience.

Results: at the design stage, human capital and relationship capital identify market issues and opportunities. at the implementation and development stage, human, relational, structural, and technological capital are effective levers to generate performance and resilience. Finally, at the marketing and consolidation stage, human, structural, relational, financial, and technological capital have an undeniable contribution. But it is above all the integration of all these factors that generates success and resilience. 

Implications and limitations: the chapter is useful for researchers, entrepreneurs and governments who will find strategies to enhance the success and resilience of technological entrepreneurship. This research is part of the theory of artificial science. The adoption of an inductive approach and a qualitative strategy is one of its limitations. Future research could use the mixed strategy to extrapolate results.
