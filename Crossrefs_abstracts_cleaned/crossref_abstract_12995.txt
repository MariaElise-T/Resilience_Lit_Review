Parametric amplifiers based on coupled-core fibers and coupled integrated waveguides are promising devices for delivering broadband and flat gain spectrum with low noise figure in vital technological applications such as optical communications. To address potential practical issues that may arise in the experimental demonstration, in the present work, we derive analytical expressions for the impact of relative input pump phase and power fluctuations between two waveguides on pump waves stability. We, furthermore, evaluate, through numerical simulations, how the pump power oscillations between the two waveguides affect the amplifier spectrum, identifying optimal regimes of operation for coupled-core fibers and also for coupled integrated waveguides. Our findings hint at the resilience of these parametric amplifiers' architectures and at their possible practical implementation in realistic labs and real-world scenarios.
