Strength-based assessment can provide a systematic way to promote mental health and resilience in children. In this article, strength-based assessment of social-emotional functioning is described. Selected standardised strength-based assessment tools and their psychometric properties are then introduced. The primary focus of the article is on the use of strength-based assessment to promote mental health for youth within a public health framework. Suggestions for using strength-based assessment within a comprehensive prevention model, including universal (school-wide), targeted, and intensive approaches, are provided. Strength-based assessment can be used at the universal level as a screening tool or for programme evaluation purposes. At the selected level, assessment tools can be used to monitor progress and determine which children may be in need of more intensive interventions. Finally, strength-based assessment can be used to evaluate strengths and competencies as part of a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation and to plan for an individualised behavioural, educational, and/or treatment plan. A process for putting these practices into action is provided.
