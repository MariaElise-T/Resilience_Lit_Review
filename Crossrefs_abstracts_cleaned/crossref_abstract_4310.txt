AbstractIce storm disasters pose great challenges to the safe and stable operation of transmission systems, especially in high‐renewable‐integration scenarios. However, as one of the major types of natural disasters that can have severe consequences, ice storm disasters are much less studied than hurricanes and earthquakes. Ice storm disasters are characterized by a long duration and wide scope, which affect the source, network, and load side of the power grid. It is difficult to formulate a quantitative evaluation of resilience and establish effective planning strategies. Here, a resilient planning method considering the interactive effects of ice disasters on sources, networks, and loads is therefore proposed. First, the two‐stage Monte Carlo method is used to generate multiple grid fault scenarios for different levels of ice storm disasters. Then, an index is proposed to quantify the grid resilience as the total amount of system power loss caused by ice storm disasters. Based on this approach, a two‐layer mathematical model is established with grid resilience and total investment cost objectives in each fault scenario. Hierarchical reinforcement and the protection of generating units and transmission lines are selected as investment strategies to mitigate the impact of ice storm disasters. Finally, the IEEE‐24 node transmission system is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Optimizing the planning strategy can significantly improve system resilience with minimal investment cost.
