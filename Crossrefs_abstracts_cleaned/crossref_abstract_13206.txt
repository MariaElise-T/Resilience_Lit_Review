Abstract
The 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization declared the beginning of a global pandemic emergency. Italy was among the first European Countries to be severely impacted by the COVID-19 virus. This short communication describes the organisation of a project investigating different responses to the pandemics, studying the assessment of local and national Health Systems resilience to a biologic hazard such is a Coronavirus. Preliminary results highlighted a fragmented response to the epidemics across the Italian territory probably connected to different public health policies or local emergency management models. The implementation of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis is provided to study which are the main important indicators to be considered in the pandemic management. The analysis highlights the successful and effective measures for pandemic planning considering different systems: health, economic, political, socio-psychological, demographic, and emergency.
