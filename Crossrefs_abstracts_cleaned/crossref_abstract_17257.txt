AbstractBackgroundSchizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder which poses substantial illness burden on affected individuals. In view of the need to better understand the growing literature on resilience (adaptation in the face of adversity) and its clinical correlates to inform and optimize clinical management in schizophrenia, we sought to summarize the extant literature which examined the inter‐relationships between resilience and demographic features, phenomenology, illness course, psychosocial functioning, and its mediational role among relevant factors.MethodsA systematic review was conducted on published empirical studies examining the topic of resilience and clinical correlates within schizophrenia spectrum conditions up until December 2020.ResultsHigher level of resilience was associated with lower severity of specific symptomatology including positive, negative, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, cognitive deficits, and better insight. Moreover, higher resilience was significantly associated with different aspects of illness course (such as shorter duration of untreated psychosis, longer duration of illness, improved symptom remission and recovery), internal factors (such as lower stigma, better self‐esteem), and psychosocial functioning (better overall, real‐life, social and interpersonal functioning, better quality of life). Resilience also acts as a mediator in pathways leading to depression, functioning, and quality of life within schizophrenia spectrum conditions.DiscussionViewed within the context of various resiliency models (compensatory, challenge, protective factor models), suggestions were made to enhance resilience and balance risk versus protective factors in order to improve disease management. Future research should seek to better elucidate associated biomarkers, inter‐relationships with carer resilience, and evaluate the efficacy of suitable resilience‐targeted interventions in schizophrenia.
