Purpose
This paper aims to propose a conceptualization of the supply chain resilience domain using conceptual modelling techniques formalized through a metamodel and illustrated through an example.


Design/methodology/approach
This research uses conceptual modelling techniques to build and modularize the metamodel, the latter to manage complexity. The metamodel was built iteratively and subsequently instantiated with an example of a yogurt factory to analyse its usefulness and theoretical relevance, and thus its contributions to the domain.


Findings
Conceptual modelling techniques can represent a complex domain such as supply chain resilience simply, and the proposed metamodel makes it possible to create models that become valuable decision support tools.


Originality/value
Consolidation and structuring of concepts in the supply chain resilience domain through conceptual modelling techniques.
