Abstract
The article analyses the influence made by corporate reputation on the mediation model for the impact of external support on organisational performance through resilience. The article aims to clarify the mechanism behind the moderating role of corporate reputation played in the influence of external support on organisational performance and considering the mediating role of organisational resilience. The empirical research was made to verify the existence of the relationship and to reach the aim of the paper. The set of hypotheses was built based on the theoretical research and then verified on the sample of 268 organisations operating in Poland. Dependences among the data selected from the theoretical research were analysed using statistical methods, including the correlation with the moderator and the mediated regression analysis. The obtained results clearly showed that corporate reputation was a moderator of the discussed mediation model for the influence of the external support on organisational performance through resilience. The paper contributes to further development of knowledge in organisational resilience management. It clarifies and stresses the role of two external factors: corporate reputation and external support in shaping the resilience of an organisation and its performance. The obtained results imply specific practical recommendations. Since corporate reputation can be the key to achieving greater organisational resilience and performance, special attention should be given to managing this category in an organisation.
