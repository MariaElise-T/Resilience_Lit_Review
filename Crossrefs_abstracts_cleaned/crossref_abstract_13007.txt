 The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test has been culturally adapted for Haitian children and objectively scored for resilience and vulnerability (Roysircar, Colvin, Afolayan, Thompson, & Robertson, 2017). The HTP was used to assess 88 Haitian children’s adjustment to the 2010 earthquake and the continuous trauma of societal inequalities. The study examined the validity of the adapted HTP test and its dimensionality. The study included participant interviews with child self-report measures of self-esteem, as perceived by self, peers, and family; posttraumatic symptoms; and self-concept. All measures were translated and administered in Créole. Analyses included standardized sample scores; descriptive statistics; internal consistency reliability; interscale correlations; a generalizability study showing that there were no differences in HTP scores due to novice or expert raters; and an exploratory factor analysis of HTP scores indicating three factors and accounting for just under 50% of the variance. The three dimensions, HTP Resilience-Vulnerability Integrated, House Feeling Safe, and Person Feeling Unloved, are discussed within the international literature on child disaster trauma assessed pictorially, and within Haitians’ spiritual worldview of suffering and endurance.
