AbstractClimate change significantly impacts the global hydrological cycle, leading to pronounced shifts in hydroclimatic extremes such as increased duration, occurrence, and intensity. Despite these significant changes, our understanding of hydroclimatic risks and hydrological resilience remains limited, particularly at the catchment scale in peninsular India. This study aims to address this gap by examining hydroclimatic extremes and resilience in 54 peninsular catchments from 1988 to 2011. We initially assess extreme precipitation and discharge indices and estimate design return levels using non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models that use global climate modes (ENSO, IOD, and AMO) as covariates. Further, hydrological resilience is evaluated using a convex model that inputs simulated discharge from the best hydrological model among SVM, RVM, random forest, and a conceptual model (abcd). Our analysis shows that the spatial patterns of mean extreme precipitation indices (R1 and R5) mostly resemble with extreme discharge indices (Q1 and Q5). Additionally, all extreme indices, including R1, Q1, R5, and Q5, demonstrate non-stationary behavior, indicating the substantial influence of global climate modes on extreme precipitation and flooding across the catchments. Our results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the others. Furthermore, we find that 68.52% of the catchments exhibit low to moderate hydrological resilience. Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding hydroclimatic risks and catchment resilience for accurate climate change impact predictions and effective adaptation strategies.
