Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are used in various safety-critical domains such as robotics, industrial manufacturing systems, and power systems. Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety violations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Traditional resiliency techniques fall short of protecting against cyber threats. In this paper, we show how to extend resiliency to cyber resiliency for CPS using a specific combination of diversification, redundancy, and the physical inertia of the system.
