In today's data-driven business landscape, maintaining the resilience of digital infrastructure is paramount. One of
the most critical components of this infrastructure is the hard disk drive (HDD). The potential for HDD failures poses a
significant risk to data integrity and operational continuity. To address this challenge, this paper presents an innovative
approach to enhancing business resilience through the predictive analysis of hard disk drive failures using machine learning
techniques. Our research leverages machine learning algorithms to predict HDD failures, enabling organizations to proactively
manage resources and mitigate potential disruptions. By harnessing historical data, system behavior patterns, and SelfMonitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) metrics, our model can accurately forecast when an HDD is
likely to fail. This predictive capability empowers organizations to optimize resource allocation, reduce downtime, and enhance
data security.
