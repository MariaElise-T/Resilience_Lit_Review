ObjectiveFacing increasingly frequent disasters, the resilience concept can make up the limitations of traditional community disaster management. This article evaluated the disaster resilience in an urban community from the perspective of capital, and provides measurements for stakeholders to enhance the community resilience.MethodsOn the basis of selected capital indicators using systematic literature review, the urban community resilience framework is established based on analytic network process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Finally, the results are analyzed using the importance–performance analysis.ResultsFirst, 12 indicators within three dimensions of community capitals are identified. Then, the weights of social, economic, and natural capital are calculated as 33, 41, and 26 percent, respectively. Afterward, taking a waterlogging disaster as an example, an aged community acquired a 46.57 score of resilience. The importance–performance quadrant shows the priority of factors to be improved.ConclusionRelationship, norms, demographic characteristics, voluntary activity, physical facilities, communication system, general property, dedicated assets, resources, energy, ecological environment, and artificial environment are considered as key capitals of community resilience. In addition, a general framework to calculate and evaluate the resilience in a community is established that provides a benchmark for rating the resilience of urban communities.
