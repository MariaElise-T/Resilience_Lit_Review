In view of the high impact of extreme disasters, this paper comprehensively evaluates power grid performance from a new low-carbon toughness perspective. First, considering the increase in carbon emissions and the recovery time of carbon emissions, low-carbon resilience indicators are proposed. At the same time, considering the power-regulation effect of the phase-shifter transformer, the fault and response model of a power grid under an ice disaster is established, and then, a comprehensive evaluation index system of low-carbon toughness of the power grid is constructed. The weight determination is carried out using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-entropy-based weight method, while the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation center of gravity method is used to evaluate the power grid comprehensively. Finally, examples are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, emphasizing its potential for evaluating the comprehensive performance of low-carbon and toughness of the power grid in the future.
