The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the urban real estate market around the world. This study regards the impact of the pandemic as a quasi-natural experiment, using the Difference in Difference model (DID) to examine the short-term impact of this severe public health crisis on the residential land and housing markets in the Yangtze River Delta. The study found that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant inhibitory effect on the average price of urban residential land and houses in the Yangtze River Delta. Although the currency oversupply has caused real estate prices in all cities to rise, the price of urban residential land decreased by 13.7% for each additional unit of epidemic severity. The greater the cityâ€™s resilience to the pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, the faster its residential land prices will recover. Empirical research on the new house samples confirmed this conclusion. Local governments should continue to improve their ability to manage abnormal conditions, not only to prevent the spread of the epidemic, but also to gradually promote the recovery of the urban economy, strengthen urban resilience to better respond to health crises, and achieve sustainable urban development.
