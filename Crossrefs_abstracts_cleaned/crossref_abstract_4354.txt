Abstract
In recent years, extreme weather is constantly emerging on a global scale. Excessive development and construction of cities has changed the original water systems of citys, and lead to urban water hazards and water environment deterioration. Since 2014, after China has been vigorously promoting the plan of sponge city and relative construction, the problems of urban water systems gradually get relieved. By introducing the concept of resilience in this study into the development of sponge city planning strategies, a comprehensive and systematic top-level design of sponge city planning and construction is made from the four dimensions of ecological resilience, engineering resilience, economic resilience and social resilience. At the same time, combining with the issues in existing pilot sponge urban planning and construction process such as the lack of systematicness, integrality, fragmentation etc., based on the study case of pilot sponge city - Guiyang city in Guizhou province, with the resilience concept as the guidance, it is presented in this study the planning strategies of sponge city ecological pattern developing, systematic planning and construction guidance, and explored the extended industrial development of sponge city and the construction control mechanism, trying to provides a new way of thinking and a new approach of sponge city planning and construction related research.
