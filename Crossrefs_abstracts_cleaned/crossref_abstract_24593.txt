Abstract
We examined relationships between resilience resources (optimism, social support, and neighborhood social cohesion) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and assessed potential effect-measure modification by psychosocial risk factors (e.g., stress, depression) among adults without CVD in 3 cohort studies (2000–2018): the Jackson Heart Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study. We fitted adjusted Cox models accounting for within-neighborhood clustering while censoring at dropout or non-CVD death. We assessed for effect-measure modification by psychosocial risks. In secondary analyses, we estimated standardized risk ratios using inverse-probability–weighted Aalen-Johansen estimators to account for confounding, dropout, and competing risks (non-CVD deaths) and obtained 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using cluster bootstrapping. For high and medium (versus low) optimism (n = 6,243), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident CVD were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.13) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.07), respectively. Corresponding HRs were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.04) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.06) for social support (n = 7,729) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.29) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.16) for social cohesion (n = 7,557), respectively. Some psychosocial risks modified CVD HRs. Secondary analyses yielded similar findings. For optimism and social support, an inverse relationship was frequently most compatible with the data, but a positive relationship was also compatible. For neighborhood social cohesion, positive and null relationships were most compatible. Thus, specific resilience resources may be potential intervention targets, especially among certain subgroups.
