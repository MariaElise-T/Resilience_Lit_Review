Over the years, aggressive competition and globalization have resulted in tremendous progress in the development and management of supply chains. There are many high-performing supply chains that have benefitted from globalization. However, globalization of supply chains has also resulted in exposure to increased risks and frequent disturbances at various stages. One way to address these disturbances is to make supply chains resilient in nature. This paper identifies and prioritizes a set of important resiliency strategies for supply chains using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP). Responses from 23 experts from the Indian pharmaceutical sector have been analyzed. We found that supply chain agility, visibility, and collaboration were the three most important resiliency strategies that a pharmaceutical organization should follow to address the vulnerability within their supply chain. The findings will serve the supply chain managers and the policymakers in designing resilient supply chains through the better understanding of strategies and formulation of action plans, while also introducing MCDM techniques into resiliency studies.
