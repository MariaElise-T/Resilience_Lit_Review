There is limited research on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on emerging adults from diverse communities, including those with disabilities, international students, and students who identify as part of the LGBTQ2AAI+ community. A purposeful sample of seven undergraduate students, between the ages of 19 and 30, at a university in British Columbia, Canada, participated in this study. In-depth narrative style interviews were conducted via Zoom. Data were analyzed thematically and from a resilience lens framework. This study demonstrates that participants experienced a diversity of challenges, and thus engaged in differing processes of adjustment. Four protective factors were identified: (1) Positive relationships; (2) Perceived efficacy; (3) Purpose and ambition; and (4) Sense of normality. This study contributes towards the limited research base, and thus offers valuable insights, which can inform university policy makers, university administration, and public health policy makers to be better positioned to develop innovative adaptions of services and/or delivery.
