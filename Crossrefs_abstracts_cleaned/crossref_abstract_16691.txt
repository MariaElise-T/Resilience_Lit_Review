The present study was designed to examine the relationship between school engagement and well-being through a sequential mediating role of growth mindset and resilience among adolescents. A sample of 350 adolescent students (male = 150) (females = 200) age ranged between 13-17 years participated from three main schools in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Results indicated that present study variables including growth mindset, resilience, school engagement, and well-being were found to have positive associations with each other. Moreover, the sequential mediation path analysis showed that resilience and growth mindset acted as significant mediators between school engagement and well-being among adolescents. Furthermore, gender differences were also calculated indicating that female students showed greater school engagement, higher levels of growth mindset, and psychological well-being in comparison to male students. Findings of the present study emphasized understanding the key positive role school environment could have in enhancing resilience and growth mindset among students resulting in their greater well-being.
