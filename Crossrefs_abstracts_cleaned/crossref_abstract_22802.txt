Most prior research on resilience to HIV/AIDS among middle-aged and older men who have sex with men (MSM) has utilized quantitative methods that employ surveys and scales to measure constructs researchers have used to approximate the concept of resilience to HIV/AIDS. Only a few studies have purposively made efforts to incorporate the input of relevant stakeholders to guide their research on HIV/AIDS resilience and examine the perspectives and lived experiences of middle-aged and older MSM. To address this research gap, we conducted a community-based participatory research qualitative study to examine the perspectives and lived experiences of HIV-positive, middle-aged and older MSM from Southern Nevada in order to identify factors that promote such resilience. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with middle-aged and older MSM living with HIV/AIDS from January to April 2022. From our thematic analysis of our interviews, we identified factors that served as facilitators or challenges to the promotion of our participants’ HIV/AIDS resilience. We discuss in this article both the facilitators and challenges to our participants’ resilience-building as the key themes from our interviews. We recognized that the impacts of these factors were mediated by their strong influence on the social determinants of health that were explicitly relevant to our participants. We offer important insights based on our findings, which could be especially useful to future research on resilience to HIV/AIDS.
