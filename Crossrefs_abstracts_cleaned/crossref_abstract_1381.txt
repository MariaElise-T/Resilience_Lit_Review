The transition from primary to secondary school represents a significant rite of passage for many young people in the UK every year. However, this transition has been linked to negative educational, social and emotional outcomes for some pupils. This longitudinal study aimed to better understand the characteristics of pupils who are most vulnerable to negative outcomes at this time. A multi-variate approach was adopted to investigate the risk and resilience factors most predictive of adjustment to secondary school. The study also explored the combined impact of pre-transfer risk and resilience factors upon post-transfer school adjustment by examining possible moderator relationships. A longitudinal non-experimental relational design was adopted. Over 130 pupils completed resilience and school adjustment questionnaires both pre- and post-transfer. Teachers also reported on pupilsâ€™ school adjustment and risk/resilience at these times.The factors consistently found to be most predictive of Teacher-Rated School Adjustment were mainly risk factors (Behaviour and Maths Attainment), whilst the variables identified as most predictive of the Pupil-Rated School Adjustment outcomes were predominantly resilience factors (Support, Self-Efficacy, Emotional Sensitivity and Emotional Impairment). Findings also suggest that high levels of specific resilience factors in primary school alone may leave pupils with Special Educational Needs less prepared for the significant changes they face in their new schools. Findings both extend and challenge previous research and emphasise the importance of considering both teacher and pupil perspectives when assessing the effects of transitions on school adjustment outcomes. The implications of findings for education professionals are considered.
