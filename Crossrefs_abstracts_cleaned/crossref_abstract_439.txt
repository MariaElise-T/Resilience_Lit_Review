 The Winter Storm Uri, which occurred in February 2021 (WSU2021), was regarded as a triple extreme weather event because it was a large winter storm, caused massive power outages, and occurred during a pandemic. The event spelled record-low temperatures, which caused power outages and blackouts, leaving over 4 million people without electricity during the ongoing pandemic. This study empirically examined the preparedness for, impacts from, and response to the WSU2021 of individual households who live in the Rio Grande Valley. Information on preparedness, impact, and the response was collected from the valley residents using an online survey instrument. The study’s findings suggested that low-income households were found to have positive associations with impact and response and negative associations with preparedness. In addition, the nation established a policy to promote and maintain the resiliency of 16 critical infrastructures 18 years ago, including the energy sector, but the efforts to make the emergency sector resilient were insufficient, leading to failing the litmus test for extreme event resiliency. Based on the study’s findings, the study concludes that it is imperative for all key stakeholders to build extreme event resiliency in the Rio Grande Valley.
