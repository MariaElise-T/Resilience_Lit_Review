The ecological crises faced by humanity require all disciplines to think differently about how we interact with the ecosphere to prevent untold misery  and possible human extinction. The fact that these crises are primarily caused by human mismanagement of our environment means that  ergonomics (literally meaning the study of human work) should play a key role in understanding and ameliorating these negative effects. This  article introduces Thatcher and Yeow’s (2016) sustainable system-of-systems model for ergonomics to the South African ergonomics community.  The sustainable system-ofsystems model blends ecological models of systems with social models of ergonomics systems to create a new model that  encapsulates this eco-socio-technical systems thinking. This article focuses on aspects of complex adaptive systems and resilience thinking to  show where ergonomics might contribute to the creation of resilient and sustainable systems. The article concludes with a set of challenges that  need to be considered when creating sustainable work systems that demonstrate resilience over time.
