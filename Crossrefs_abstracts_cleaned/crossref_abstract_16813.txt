The research objective is to develop an algorithm for assessing the cyber resilience of the operational dispatch control (ODC) system of electric power system (EPS) during cyberattacks on data collecting, processing, and transmitting systems. The research methods include the probabilistic methods, fuzzy set theory methods, and methods of EPS reliability analysis. Result of the research: the impact of cyberattacks on the functionality of the EPS ODC system is analyzed. The factors ensuring the cyber resilience of the EPS ODC system in the case of materialization of cyber threats are identified. A model of cyber resilience of the EPS ODC system is proposed. An algorithm for assessing the cyber resilience of the EPS ODC system is developed factoring in the cybersecurity risks.
