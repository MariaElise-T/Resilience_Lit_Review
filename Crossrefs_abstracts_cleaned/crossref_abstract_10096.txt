AbstractThe security control problem for a class of unknown nonlinear systems is considered in this paper. For the nonlinear system running in the network environment, the measurement channel is subjected to hybrid attacks. Intermittent denial of service attacks and false data injection attacks are modeled as the hybrid attacks. According to the characteristics of the repetitive system, a resilient iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm under hybrid attacks is devised. Subsequently, the stability of the system is proved by mathematical derivation and theoretical analysis in the sense of mathematical expectation. The theoretical analysis results indicate that the resilient ILC algorithm can ensure the stability of the system, and the tracking error converges with the increased number of iterations. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulation and mobile robot simulation.
