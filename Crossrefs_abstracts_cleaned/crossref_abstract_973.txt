The family has a pivotal role in social development, as it represents the fundamental unit of society that contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Consequently, policies geared towards enhancing family well-being, such as poverty reduction, health, and education, are indispensable. Inevitably, families encounter challenges and difficulties, especially for poor household with limited capacity and resources to buffer from shocks. Nevertheless, some families are able to rebound quickly and learn from their struggles, a phenomenon known as resilience. Family resilience denotes a family's strength capacity to rebound from adversity and emerge stronger and more empowered. Using a depth interview method in Tapos, Depok, West Java, Indonesia, this study examines family resilience based on Froma Walsh's Key Processes, analyzing the strengths that enable families to overcome adversity. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, comprising two underprivileged families that receive government social assistance. Despite coming from impoverished backgrounds, these families possess resilience values that enable them to effectively fulfill their social roles and realize their aspirations. The findings reveal that family spirituality, adaptability, family connectedness, and communities support facilitate family members to grow and thrive despite adversity.
