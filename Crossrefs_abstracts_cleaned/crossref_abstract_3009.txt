SummaryThis paper considers the resilient interval consensus problems for continuous‐time time‐varying multi‐agent systems when a normal agent is surrounded by no more than r misbehaving agents. Each normal agent individually proposes a constraint interval which specifies their acceptable consensus range and misbehaving agents are anonymous and exert different arbitrary rules posing threats to the global performance of the systems. On the basis of our purely distributed resilient interval consensus strategy, we showed that if the network is (2r + 1)‐robust and the interval intersection is nonempty, the normal agents are able to reach an agreement with the final consensus equilibrium in the interval intersection. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretical results.
