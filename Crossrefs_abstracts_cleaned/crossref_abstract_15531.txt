 The purpose of this article is to describe the Black Love, Activism, and Community (BLAC) model of healing and resilience. The assumption of the BLAC model is that Black activism is inspired and sustained by love and community. Building on empirical research, liberation psychology, and African-centered psychology, the BLAC model identifies four culturally grounded domains of resilience (relationships, spirituality, identity, and active expression) that are hypothesized to serve as protective factors. These domains are also postulated to be critical components of culturally centered healing practices. Within the context of anti-Black racism, it is important to understand how activism can mitigate mental health outcomes among Black activists. The BLAC model also describes culturally centered intervention approaches for healing and wellness. Finally, applications of the BLAC model are discussed.
