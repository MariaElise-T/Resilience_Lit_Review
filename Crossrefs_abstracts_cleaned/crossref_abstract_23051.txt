Background: Guts, Resilience, Integrity, and Tenacity (GRIT) is an optimistic character that mixes passion and dedication. It is a driver of achievement and success, independent of and beyond what intelligence and talent contribute. The study aimed to assess GRIT and factors influencing it among mid-adolescent school students (13–18 years) in the Perambalur district, Tamilnadu, India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among mid-adolescent school students. We used a self-reported questionnaire to collect the data on sociodemographic characteristics and parents’ details and the standard eight-item GRIT questions. Analysis was done with the total and subscale scores. Results: Among the 1663 participants, 966 (58.1%) were males. The mean (SD) age was 15.6 (1.19) years. The mean GRIT score was 26.65 (4.12). Most students (755) showed medium (45.4%) GRIT scores. The age factor had a weak negative correlation with GRIT ( r = −0.052, p = 0.033) and females had higher scores ( t = 9.13, p = 0.002). Perseverance of effort was significantly more in those from a rural background ( t = 1.9, p = 0.012), while consistency of interest was more in those from urban background ( t = 0.63, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Most students had average or medium GRIT scores, with higher GRIT among females. The concept of GRIT should be properly addressed among children during their school years in order to inspire them to dream with passion and perseverance.
