This paper will explain the concept behind mental resilience training (MRT) and how the training package was developed and implemented within the British ArmyInfantry Training Centre (ITC) Catterick between 2014 and 2016. MRT is a mindfulness-based psychological skills training package that integrates cognitive behavioural and mindfulness based principles and techniques, which have been proven to improve stress regulation, emotional and cognitive control and self-confidence in military personnel. MRT is based on an extensive evidence base that has demonstrated that psychological skills training delivers tangible improvements in performance in elite sport and in healthcare, business and military contexts. The initial trials at the ITC Catterick have delivered tangible improvements in infantry recruitsâ€™ use of psychological skills within real-life training contexts.
