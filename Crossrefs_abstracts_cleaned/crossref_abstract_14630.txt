This research article delves into Lean Thinking and Strategy and incorporates their effects on psychological resilience, cultural adaptability and economic sustainability. This paper offers a current perspective on combining Strategic Management with Lean Thinking through an up-to-date review of literature. It traces the path from Toyota’s production system to development of Lean Thinking across various industries with emphasis on waste reduction and continuous improvement. This interplay between Lean Thinking and Strategy is evidenced by the findings which suggest combining them can lead to efficient, customer-centered, agile organizational practices. The study examines how combining Lean Thinking and Strategy can enhance psychological resilience, promote cultural adaptability, as well as ensure economic sustainability. This article’s theoretical discussions indicate that there is a positive relationship between these concepts. It is therefore essential to verify this empirically. The study ends with some recommendations for implementation and integration, along with future empirical research to look into similar integration within other organizational contexts.
