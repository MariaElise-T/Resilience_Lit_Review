The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact and changed many aspects of human life. More than 50% of the number of people infected with COVID-19 in Jakarta are young adults. Therefore, young adult Covid-19 survivors are one of the groups who feel the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The high stigma of society towards Covid-19 has further worsened public acceptance of Covid-19 survivors. In addition, their self-productivity and career development are hampered due to social restrictions. This also results in the difficulty of finding work and even layoffs in various places. The condition and presence of Covid-19 survivors can cause anxiety and this anxiety greatly disrupts the lives of Covid-19 survivors. Prolonged and untreated anxiety can lead to self-defeating actions such as the emergence of suicidal intentions, so anxiety needs to be addressed as early as possible. Keye and Pidgeon (2013) called resilience as the mental capacity that can help and maintain a person's psychological stability in dealing with anxiety. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between resilience and anxiety in young adult Covid-19 survivors. This study involved 310 Covid-19 survivors aged 18 to 40. The measuring instruments used in this study were the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and The Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (DC-RISC). The data were analyzed using quantitative analysis methods, namely the spearman correlation technique. Based on the results of data processing, the correlation coefficient or r = -0.313 with significance or p = 0.000 Ë‚ 0.05. This means that there is a significant negative relationship between anxiety and resilience in young adult Covid-19 survivors in Jakarta.
