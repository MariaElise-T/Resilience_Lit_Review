The sample of the study consisted of 255 Turkish women over the age of 18 who had at least one child. The data collection instruments used were the " Conflict Zone Determination Scale" the "Relationship Stability Scale" the "Relational Resilience Scale" and the "Personal Information Form" developed by the researcher. SPSS 25.0 and Hayes's macro PROCESS 4.0 were used to analyze the data. As a result of the analyzes, it was found that there were low negative significant relationships between conflict frequency and relationship resilience, high positive relationships between relationship resilience and relationship satisfaction and low negative significant relationships between conflict frequency and relationship satisfaction. As a result of this research, it was found that conflict frequency predicted relational resilience, relational resilience predicted relationship satisfaction, and conflict frequency predicted relationship satisfaction. At the same time, relational resilience was found to play a mediating role in the relationship between conflict frequency and relationship satisfaction.
