AbstractIntroductionInternalized stigma is known to be high in bipolar disorder (BD). Concepts such as self‐compassion and psychological resilience have recently begun to be studied as protective factors for BD. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationships between internalized stigma, self‐compassion and resilience among individuals with BD.MethodOne hundred and thirty‐two male and female (18‐65 years of age) participants with a DSM 5 diagnosis of BD (BD‐ I & BD‐ II) were included. The remission criteria (YMRS< 5 and HDRS< 7) was evaluated using clinician‐administered measures and all participants were found to be remitted. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed. Participants completed the Internalized Stigma in Mental Illness Scale (ISMI), the Self‐Compassion Scale (SCS) and the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA).ResultsSignificant correlations were found between internalized stigma, sub‐dimensions of self‐compassion (self‐kindness, self‐judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over‐identification), and resilience in the expected directions like negative correlations between internalized stigma and positive dimensions of self‐compassion (self‐kindness, common humanity and mindfulness). Self‐judgement and self‐kindness mediated the relationship between internalized stigma and psychological resilience.ConclusionsThe findings of the study shed light on which dimensions of self‐compassion might be more beneficial to work with in order to increase resilience when working with internalized stigma in BD. This strengths‐based investigation would be valuable to enrich psycho‐social interventions for the prevention of relapse in BD.
