Epidemiological studies reported that resilience, generally regarded as the ability to manage stress in the face of adversity, correlates with mental health in middle-aged and older adults. Currently, there is limited information on eating habits that affect resilience. Therefore, this cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between vitamin intake and resilience based on sex in community-dwelling middle-aged and older individuals in Shika town, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. A total of 221 participants (106 men and 115 women) aged 40 years or older were included in the analysis. We assessed vitamin intake and resilience using a brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) and the resilience scale (RS), respectively. A two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that higher intakes of β-carotene and vitamin K were associated with higher RS in women, but not in men. Furthermore, a multiple logistic regression analysis stratified by sex showed that β-carotene and vitamin K were significant independent variables for RS only in women. The present study suggests that higher intakes of β-carotene and vitamin K were associated with higher resilience among middle-aged and older women. The results obtained demonstrate that β-carotene and vitamin K intakes may enhance resilience by strengthening stress tolerance.
