Abstract
The implementation of lockdown measures to curb the transmission of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has brought about significant psychological impacts and older adults have been identified as one of the vulnerable groups. In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires—COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual’s engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors.
