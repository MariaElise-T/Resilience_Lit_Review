Background:
The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has great potentials in
next-generation railway train control systems. Considering the fail-safe characteristics of train control,
the threat from GNSS interference may result in an increasing likelihood of outages of train
positioning or even safety risks to the railway system.


Objective:
The interference protection solutions are investigated and demonstrated for achieving the
resilient train positioning using GNSS.


Methods:
This paper describes the main types of GNSS interference and investigates the impact on
Location Determination Unit (LDU) in the GNSS-based train control system. Specific architectures
and solutions for interference detection and protection in both the position domain and measurement
domain are presented.


Results:
Interference injection simulations are performed with both the GNSS spoofing and jamming
signals, which evaluate the effects of interferences and demonstrate the protection performance
of the presented solutions under GNSS attack scenarios.


Conclusion:
The interference protection solutions within both the position domain and measurement
domain are effective and significant to mitigate the effects from the GNSS interference, which
enables resilient train positioning to achieve safe train operation.
