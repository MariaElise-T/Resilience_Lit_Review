Background. The problem of individual resilience is becoming especially relevant today, when Ukraine is at war. The issue of preserving physical and mental health of Ukrainians is especially important. No one here was not ready to live and work in war conditions. At the same time, we are able to form an optimal response to these events with the help of resilience. The purpose of the article is to identify the key resilience strategies of Ukrainian teachers in war conditions based on the analysis of the results of the research conducted by the authors. Methods. This research is a part of wider program "Codes of resilience", developed to improve the resilience skills of teachers. The authors use the multidimensional model of overcoming stress and finding internal stability "BasicPh" of Prof. Mooli Lahad to identify the key resilience strategies of Ukrainian teachers in war conditions. This model consists six channels for coping with stress: – belief; A – affect; S – sociability; I – imagination; C – cognition; Ph – physiology. Results. The results of the study showed that the most influential way to overcome stress for teachers is their cognitive settings. Information analysis, critical thinking skills, planning strategies, etc. are the most common ways among teachers to respond to external challenges. The second most influential factor of stress resistance is the worldview of teachers. It turned out that teachers do not actively use their own emotional settings to overcome stress. The same we can say regarding their creative settings. The readiness of teachers to rely on the strength of communities in difficult times (social settings) also needs additional attention and additional research. This factor was the least influential.
