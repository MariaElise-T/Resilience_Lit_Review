            Resilience, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important factors to consider as student military Veterans work to reintegrate into society. The impact of these factors on academic success is not fully understood, but is important for rehabilitation professionals, student advisors, and counselors. The current study examined the impact of resilience, depression, PTSD, and TBI on student Veteran academic outcomes, and whether the amount of student Veterans' military experience moderated the effect of these factors on academic performance. Seventy-seven student Veterans completed measures that assessed resilience, grade point average, academic disruptions, and symptoms of depression, PTSD, and TBI. Path analysis was used to determine the manner in which the variables influenced academic performance. Results indicate that student Veterans should not be viewed as a homogeneous group and their needs differ based on level of military experience. Academic disruption among less experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of depression, whereas academic disruption among more experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of TBI.
