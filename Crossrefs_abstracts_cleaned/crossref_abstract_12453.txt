 Numerous training interventions on patient handoffs have been initiated in the last few years, in part to meet new residency program accreditation requirements. Most of these programs focus on increasing the structure, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of the information conveyed by the outgoing clinician in either verbal or written format. Our team has developed online training that can augment these programs with how to foster resilient communication that increases overall system resilience, and thus reduces unintended patient harm. It is anticipated that improving communication competencies with resilient strategies during real-time verbal exchanges conducted at the shift change will increase the likelihood of detecting and addressing erroneous diagnostic assessments, prognoses, and inappropriate elements of treatment plans.
