 To ascertain whether children and adolescents whose ages ranged from 9 to 17 years described distinct profiles of personal resiliency, the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA) were administered to 100 youth who were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit and were diagnosed with various DSM-IV-TR disorders along with the Beck Youth Inventories of Emotional and Social Impairment (BYI-II). Four profiles based on the RSCA Sense of Self-Mastery, Sense of Relatedness, and Emotional Reactivity scales were identified by a k-means nonhierarchical cluster analysis. The profiles were not differentiated with respect to sex, age, being Caucasian, or diagnoses, but were discriminated with respect to different levels of self-reported symptoms as measured by the BYI-II scales. The results were discussed as suggesting that different profiles of personal resiliency should be considered when treating psychiatric inpatients.
