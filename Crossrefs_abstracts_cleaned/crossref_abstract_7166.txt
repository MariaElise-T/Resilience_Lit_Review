Greyfields are construction sites that emerge from the expansion of cities towards rural settings. They are unused structures in settlement areas that negatively impact the habitats and lead to ecologically, economically, and socially problematic zones. This study aims to examine the Greyfield problem, which emerges as one of the outcomes of urban sprawl, within the context of Transect Theory and urban resilience. We analyze the Greyfield problem in the Arapkoy rural settlement, which is located along the north coastline of Kyrenia, Cyprus. This study presents the impact of Greyfield sites on environmental, social, and economic values within the framework of Transect Theory. Thus, a road map for the redevelopment of Greyfields into public use is put forward to be used for future planning activities, which is a necessity in enabling urban resilience.
