The authors utilized hierarchical multiple regression to understand the relationships between complex trauma, family environment, family cohesion, and resilience in 485 young adults aged 18â€“35. The young adults varied regarding their educational background and experiences with trauma. Results demonstrated that youth with more experiences of complex trauma were associated with lower levels of resilience. However, when they reported strong family environments and family cohesion prior to adulthood, they were more likely to be resilient in young adulthood despite the complex trauma experienced. Hence, family environment and family cohesion appear to be protective factors despite complex trauma exposure. Implications for family counselors working with trauma and resilience building through a systemic lens are discussed.
