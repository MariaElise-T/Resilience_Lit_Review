Aims/Background: Rehabilitation of spinal cord injury focuses on resilience in all aspects of daily living. In order to improve functional outcomes, obstacles to achieving resilience must be recognised. This study explored the process of non-resilience in a spinal cord injury population in Iran. Methods: This qualitative study was part of a grounded theory study. The experiences of 24 participants, including 16 people with spinal cord injury, and 8 people with spinal care experience (3 caregivers, 2 occupational therapists, 1 physiotherapist, 1 social worker and 1 nurse), were explored through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using constant comparative analysis. Findings: Seven main concepts emerged from analysis of the interviews: lack of essential knowledge, dependence, psychosexual preoccupation, confusion, lack of accommodation, inappropriate feedback, and inability to adapt. Social deprivation was found to be the participants' main concern. Conclusion: Resilience requires adaptation in all areas of daily living. Detecting barriers to resilience is important in planning rehabilitation programmes in people with a spinal cord injury. Improving social support for people with a spinal cord injury can promote their mobility within the community and mental health.
