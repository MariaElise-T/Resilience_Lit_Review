 Suitable rootstock enhances apple tree resilience. In 2021, we studied “Buckeye Gala” apple ( Malus domestica var. Buckeye Gala") on nine rootstocks with contrasting vigor in NS and BC, Canada. Rootstock effects on vigor, yield, and midday stem water potential were significant in BC. After sustained heat events, the large-dwarfing rootstocks Geneva 935, Geneva 4814, and Geneva 969 had lower ratio of sunburn fruits, resulting in higher projected damage-free yield. We discussed how higher stem water potential and larger canopy volume supported by vigorous rootstocks contributed to alleviate heat stress and improve apple resilience to global warming.
