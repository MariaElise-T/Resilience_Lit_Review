The Covid-19 pandemic has recently created an environment of chaos that modern societies have not experienced. The reactions of countries and societies to this new situation are different. The health policies implemented by countries in the fight against the outbreak during the Covid-19 pandemic process have an impact on the resilience of communities and constitute a determining factor in all kinds of losses. The concept of resilience has been increasingly used in the literature in recent years. Resilience, as a word meaning, is defined as the capacity of a system to continue its functions with the reactions it gives to the external effects it is exposed to. The purpose of this research is to explain the difficulties faced by societies during the Covid-19 pandemic process with selected country examples in the relationship of resilience. In this context, the countries of China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, India, the United States of America and Brazil were evaluated in terms of significant health policy differences and the losses suffered by the societies. Administrative or political skills of countries, existence of processes that ensure transparency, infrastructure and capacity of health systems and social capital determine the resilience capacity.
