These four nouns are taken out of the article titles on offer in this issue. Uncover within the systemic transitions taking place, the coherence required, the resilience that has emerged, and the joy that may be found in food production, distribution and consumption.
With this issue also comes the inaugural installment of a new series called the Canadian Food Studies Choux Questionnaire. A riff on the Proust Questionnaire, we skirt the obvious food-related point of entry, the madeleine. We are interested in more than just the remembrance of things past. The lighter, more versatile choux bun is the receptacle for everything from crème pâtissière to tuna, from food fears to greatest edible achievements. Food philosopher Lisa Heldke is our first respondent.
And because we have been feeling particularly inquisitive of late, we have asked our contributing authors to tell us about themselves. It’s biography by way of lunch menus and food literature.
