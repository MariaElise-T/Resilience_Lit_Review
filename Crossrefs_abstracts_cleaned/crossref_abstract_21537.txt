National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project was launched by ICAR in 2011 to develop climate-resilient agriculture technologies through strategic research. It demonstrates and reinforced to accept better practices and wide-ranging technologies for mitigating climate risk to make farming as a profitable business. The current study was carried out in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The sample consists of 60 farmers as beneficiaries from NICRA villages and 60 farmers as nonbeneficiaries from non-NICRA villages were selected randomly. The ex-post facto research design was used in the study. The constraints faced by the farmers for adoption of climate resilient technologies were lack of sufficient rainfall, lack of owned resources, lack of short duration and drought tolerant crop varieties, lack of knowledge about climate resilient practices, and inadequate financial support. The key suggestions given to the respondents for implementation of climate resilient technologies are the provision of technical guidance and information should be delivered on regular basis, training programs should be conducted about climate resilient practices, financial assistance should be rendered for water and soil conservation and need based technology demonstrations should be given.
