Purpose – The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between risk managing capabilities, resilience, and shared value creation behavior for local MICE companies. Design/Methodology/Approach – This study will explore what kind of risk managing capabilities local MICE Alliance has used to pass through the long tunnel of Covid 19, and how they have demonstrated their ability to maintain and revive their organizations through risk managing and supply chain capabilities. An empirical survey was conducted with MICE Alliance member companies in regions except for Seoul and the metropolitan area. A total of 190 samples were collected for data analysis. Findings – While the supply chain capabilities had no impact on resilience, business performance resources had an effect on resilience. It is also noticeable that resilience had a significant impact on ESG-based shared value creation. Research Implications – In this study, the relationship between risk management capacity, resilience, and ESG-based shared value creation, which had been conducted in previous studies, was expanded to the local MICE alliance, playing a role in laying the theoretical foundation. In addition, although the supply chain capacity has no effect on resilience, it presents a homework that requires serious consideration for the sustainable MICE industry environment in the future.
