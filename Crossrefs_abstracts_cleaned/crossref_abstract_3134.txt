This paper proposes a non-recurrent training algorithm, resilient propagation, for the Simultaneous Recurrent Neural network operating in relaxation-mode for computing high quality solutions of static optimization problems. Implementation details related to adaptation of the recurrent neural network weights through the non-recurrent training algorithm, resilient backpropagation, are formulated throughan algebraic approach. Performance of the proposed neuro-optimizer on a well-known static combinatorial optimization problem, the Traveling Salesman Problem, is evaluated on the basis of computational complexity measures and, subsequently, compared to performance of the Simultaneous Recurrent Neural network trained with the standard backpropagation, and recurrent backpropagation for the same static optimization problem. Simulation results indicate that the Simultaneous Recurrent Neural network trained with the resilient backpropagation algorithm is able to locate superior quality solutions through comparable amount of computational effort for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
