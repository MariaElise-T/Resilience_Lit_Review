In the framework of the ion cyclotron resonance frequency heating development at CEA Cadarache, a prototype antenna based on the load-resilient electrical layout foreseen for ITER has been built. This prototype was recently tested in Tore Supra. The ITER-like electrical scheme has been validated during fast perturbations at the edge plasma. Clear load resilience properties are reported. The main conclusions and consequences learned from the development of the ITER antenna are discussed.
