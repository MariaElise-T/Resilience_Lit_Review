The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between the sense of coherence and resilience and the styles of stress coping and to determine which of the studied variables (comprehensibility; manageability; meaningfulness; optimistic attitude and energy; perseverance and determination in action; sense of humour and openness to new experiences; personal competences and tolerance of negative affect) was more important in predicting coping styles with stressful situations in the group of juveniles who had been referred to probation centres. Participants in this study were 210 juveniles from probation centres. The following research tools were used in the research: A. Antonovsky’s Orientation to Life Questionnaire, Resilience Scale by N. Ogińska-Bulik and Z. Juczyński, and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations by N. S. Enlder and J. D. A. Parker. The research results show that sense of coherence and resilience play a predictive function for the style which focuses on the task, emotions, avoidance and strategy related to engaging in substitute activities and seeking contact with people. Building (by probation officers) the sense of coherence and resilience among juveniles involves better understanding of the surrounding world and the stimuli which come from it, understanding internal signals and increasing the sense of manageability and comprehensibility, enhancing the ability to use the own and the environmental resources as well as working on the sense of meaningfulness, i.e. the motivational aspect of functioning. Supporting components of resilience (optimistic attitude and energy; perseverance and determination in action; sense of humour and openness to new experiences; personal competences and tolerance of negative affect) through psychoeducational activities (in probation centres) enables better understanding of the own self and, consequently, using stress management strategies aimed at finding a positive solution to a particular situation.
