This quantitative research aimed to fill the research gap by examining the mediating effect of perceived social support between received social support and resilience. This study's measure of social support comprised three types: emotional, informational, and instrumental. A total of 120 participants were recruited using snowball sampling. To examine the mediating effect, Hayes Process Macro Model 4 was used as a tool for mediation analysis. The result showed that only perceived emotional and informational support were found to mediate between received social support and resilience. Results supported the critical role of cognitive processing after receiving social support in affecting resilience levels. It could further apply to the counseling services, suggesting that psychoeducation or follow-up on clients' perception of the social support they received from their social network matters to the therapy outcome. Social support and cognitive processing efforts are indispensable in practical counseling sessions.
