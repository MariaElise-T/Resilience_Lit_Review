Abstract  Purpose: This study sought to analyze the elements that compose the resilience of organizations when facing a disruptive event, using as context the crisis caused by Covid-19.  Originality/value: The study of organizational resilience helps us to theorize, more accurately, organizational adjustment and adaptation in increasingly complex and difficult-to-understand environments. However, although their research has shown promise, its concept still needs more independent attention and empirical validation. In this sense, this paper contributes to a holistic view with a consistent definition of the term through a quantitatively validated model since most of the empirical studies found in the literature are qualitative in nature.  Design/methodology/approach: A survey was applied to test a model for measuring organizational resilience, through an exploratory factor analysis, in addition to the use of simple descriptive statistics. Data collection occurred between November 9 and December 23, 2021, through an electronic form with 41 respondents (companies).  Findings: The tested model showed a high level of reliability (McDonald’s ω of 0.955) and can be applied within organizations to measure their resilience. The tested model comprises 12 items: unity of purpose; stress testing plans; strategic planning; proactive posture; breaking silos; leveraged knowledge; internal resources; effective partnerships; innovation and creativity; decision-making; staff engagement; and leadership.
