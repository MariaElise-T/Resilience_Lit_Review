AbstractAimIn 2010, we interviewed 16 UK centenarians about their lives and later published a paper on the socio‐emotional aspects of positive ageing. We were struck by their ability to ‘move on’ from difficult situations which we recognized conceptually as ‘resilience’. In the effort to understand aspects of resilience as portrayed in their stories, we re‐examined their data.MethodologyIn the original study, we used participatory action research (PAR) for its storytelling and group process components. Here, we re‐examine data from the centenarians’ life stories using a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) lens.DesignWe focused on the notion of resilience in the centenarians’ stories guided by CBT insights to analyse and develop psychosocial interpretations.ResultsResilience comprised the ability to frame difficult life events in positive terms, accept what cannot be changed, manage worry and anxiety effectively, develop psychological flexibility in the face of change and continually seek opportunities for growth and development. We suggest that these resilient behaviours may have contributed to positive ageing.
