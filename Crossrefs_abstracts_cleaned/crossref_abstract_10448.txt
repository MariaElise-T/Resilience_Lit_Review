The intended focus of this study on the accountancy students in Pakistan is due to the pressure to excel academically combined with a heavy workload, high academic pressure and frequent examinations leads to high levels of academic burnout among accountancy students. The present study was carried out to identify the relationship between grit, academic resilience and academic burnout among accountancy students. Data was comprised of 400 accountancy students of which 202 were males and 198 females who were recruited through purposive sampling technique. Their age ranged from 19-26 years (M = 22.09; SD = 2.06). Three scales were used to collect responses from participants; Academic Resilience Scale (ARS-30) (Cassidy, 2016), Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (Campos et al., 2013) and 12-Item-Grit Scale (Duckworth et al., 2007). The correlation analysis revealed significantly positive relationship between grit and academic resilience while significantly negative correlation with academic burnout. Moreover, the linear regression analysis established grit as the strongest negative predictor of academic burnout while mediation analysis observed the role of academic resilience between grit and academic burnout. The present research is helpful in understanding the role of these variables and their impact on accountancy students. The findings of the study would help in developing effective counseling and resilience enhancement interventions to facilitate accountancy students to deal with their academic burnout.
