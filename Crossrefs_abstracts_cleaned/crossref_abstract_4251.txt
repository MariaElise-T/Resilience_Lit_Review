 The resilient modulus and cumulative permanent strain of subgrade soils under anticipated repeated loading are important considerations for the design of a pavement against fatigue and rutting failures. A simple model was developed to evaluate the resilient modulus and accumulated permanent strain of cohesive subgrade soils under repeated loads. The empirical model was derived from the observed behavior of an A-6 cohesive soil. The model was tested against an A-5 soil. The proposed model was found to predict adequately the resilient modulus and the accumulated plastic strain for all A-6 and A-5 specimens with 90 percent confidence intervals of 0.61 and 1.4, and 0.66 and 1.39, respectively.
