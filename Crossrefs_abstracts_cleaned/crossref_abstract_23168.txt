This paper describes a protocol for the feasibility evaluation of the Participatory Action Research on Social and Emotional Learning (PARSEL) programme. PARSEL aims to contribute towards the development of academic achievement and resilience among urban refugee students in a community learning centre in an upper middle-income country. The evaluation is a single arm pre-post design using a mixed methods approach, with the main focus on the feasibility of the programme. Measurements of impact are also included as the secondary outcomes of the study. The programme aims to enrol students from refugee background in a community learning centre. The programme is estimated to run for 18 months and the study is due to report in the end of fourth quarter of 2022.
