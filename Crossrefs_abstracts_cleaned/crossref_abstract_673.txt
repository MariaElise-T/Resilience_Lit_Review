AbstractThe present study examined whether general self‐efficacy (GSE) mediated the association between resiliency and academic engagement, and whether social support moderated the mediating process. Participants included 1549 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 16.71 years old, 629 boys). Using self‐reported questionnaires, our study found that, after controlling for youth age, sex, and family socioeconomic status, GSE partially mediated the positive relation between resiliency and academic engagement. Further, social support moderated the association between resiliency and GSE, as well as the association between resiliency and academic engagement. Findings underline the significance of identifying the mediating and moderating factors linking resiliency and academic engagement. Implications and future research directions were discussed.
