Using the linear output feedback method, we investigate the resilient synchroniz ation for a class of chaotic systems. The influence of uncertainties in controll er itself is weakened. By the LMI (linear matrix inequality) toolbox, the resili ent controller is derived conveniently. Finally, the computer simulation results  illustrate the validity of the method and the importance of the research.
