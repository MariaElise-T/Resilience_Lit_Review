 This paper describes a procedure for evaluating the reduction in impact sound pressure level of floating floors by measuring the apparent dynamic stiffness of the resilient layer, according to International Standard EN 29052-1. The impact sound pressure level experimental data, obtained according to International Standard UNI EN ISO 140-8, was compared with estimates obtained from dynamic stiffness measurements. Results confirm the effectiveness of the empirical model. Two questions are addressed. The first concerns the decrease in layer thickness over time. The second concerns the relationship between damping ratio and performance.
