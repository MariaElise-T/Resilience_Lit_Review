Background and purposeThere are a lack of documentation on psychometric assessments on the Malay version of 14-item Resilience scale (RS-14) in Malaysia. This study was to empirically assess its reliability and validity.MethodA prospective test–retest design was employed on Malaysian women with early breast cancer (N = 105). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.ResultsThe results showed overall Cronbach alpha values were .92 and .93 for test–retest, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between .62 and .75. This study accepted three factors and two factors for test–retest, respectively. Individual factors showed Cronbach alpha average ranged from .71 to .91.ConclusionThe Malay version RS-14 tool was found to be statistically valid, reliable, and reproducible. It was able to measure resilience level in those women under study.
