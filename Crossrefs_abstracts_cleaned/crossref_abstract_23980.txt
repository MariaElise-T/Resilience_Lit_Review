AbstractThe 2019 European Congress of Radiology program, “Women in Focus: Be Inspired,” offered insights from successful women and men for overcoming a number of everyday work and personal life challenges. With regard to balancing career and personal life and achieving well-being, the advice of female and male radiology leaders on the front lines, throughout the world, shares common themes. This paper highlights and expands on points of advice and encouragement from the “Women in Focus” program. The first step is to know yourself, so you can set priorities. Then, take charge, be brave, and follow your dreams, which may not be the same as other people’s. Finding balance requires examining your goals and acknowledging that you may not be able to get everything you want all at once. Receiving effective mentorship from numerous sources is key, as is finding an environment that supports your growth. It is important to surround yourself both at work and at home with people who support your ideas and give you a sense of peace, well-being, and resilience. If the culture does not fit, have the courage to move on. Current leaders should reach out to ensure the diversity of future teams. Society benefits, radiology benefits, and our patients benefit from a specialty that values equity, diversity, and inclusiveness.
