Preface to the CISBAT 2019 Journal of Physics: Conference Series special issue

CISBAT 2019 took place from 4 to 6 September 2019 at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland under the heading “Climate Resilient Buildings - Energy Efficiency & Renewables in the Digital Era”.
Focused on energy efficiency and the use of renewables in buildings and cities, CISBAT bi-annually offers a dynamic platform for scientific exchange in fields ranging from nanostructured materials for renewable energy applications in buildings to urban energy systems.
