PurposeThis study explores how small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry in Puerto Rico can enhance resilience to cope with critical infrastructure (CI) collapse due to natural disasters. This study aims to validate the food supply chain (FSC) resilience model for SMEs in rural areas.Design/methodology/approachThis study used qualitative in-depth interviews to gather data and a coding process for the analysis. The participants were members of the FSC located in the municipality of Adjuntas and nearby towns in Puerto Rico. For this study, the sample participants selected to conduct the interviews were the farmers, producers and retailers.FindingsThe results show the importance of local CI backup, networks and flexibility among FSC members in alternating supply chain logistics and distribution. Other transportation modes include drone pilots, aerial and land, facilities to transport and deliver merchandise and positioning farmers and producers as important players in the FSC.Originality/valueA modified FSC resilience model from previous research is presented to include SMEs located in highly vulnerable remote zones, where access to resources is limited after a disruptive event, and a typology of enterprises with local CI backup according to their level of adoption of resilient practices. This study contributes to enhancing resilience and mitigating the vulnerabilities of SMEs after the CI collapses.
