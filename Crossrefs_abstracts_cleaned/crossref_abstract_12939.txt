The article examines the problem of resilience building in adolescents affected by the armed conflict; presents and analyzes theoretical and empirical studies on internal and external resources for the individual resilience
building in adolescents, resilience development dynamics, experiencing of psychological trauma and choice of coping strategies by adolescents in a context of armed conflicts; examines the concept of resilience building through the approach of resilience as a process and the social ecology model; focuses on crucial role of social and cultural context for the individual resilience development. In a period of adolescence an individual psyche is being transformed and proved to be especially vulnerable. This process of transformation becomes complicated and burdened with psychological trauma experienced in a situation of armed conflict. The resilience approach, in contrast to the traditional trauma-oriented paradigm, focuses on importance of inner potentials and external protective factors for resilience building, on individual capability to activate psychic resources and recover in extreme situation of armed conflict. The resilience approach and social ecology model allow to present structurally the problem of resilience building in conflict-affected adolescents with considering the interaction of inner and external resources: personal characteristics and contextual factors. Negative effect of risk factors in war conditions appear to be decreased or mitigated by activation of protective factors. Individual characteristics, different social and cultural contexts, as well as specifics of an armed conflict situation, shape difference in resilience building and coping processes. All of those should be thoroughly examined and taken into consideration while developing and implementing effective comprehensive intervention programs for resilience building and strengthening.
