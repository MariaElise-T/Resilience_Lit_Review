The objective of this study was to investigate the direct effects of pain-induced depression and anxiety, as well as the mediating role of psychological resilience, on the psychological distress associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The method involved a sample of 196 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and applied the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale, and visual analog scale for pain. Bivariate and path analyses were performed, and a multiple mediational model was utilized. Results showed that all correlations among study variables were significant (p < 0.01). A partial mediation effect of psychological resilience was observed, and direct effects among the variables (pain, psychological resilience, anxiety, and depression) were statistically significant, including the direct effect of psychological resilience on depression and anxiety. The indirect effects of pain through psychological resilience on depression and anxiety were also significant. Thus, the results suggest that psychological resilience partially mediates the effects of pain-induced anxiety and depression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
