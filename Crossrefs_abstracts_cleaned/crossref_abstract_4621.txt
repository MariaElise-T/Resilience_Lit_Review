Teaching is regarded as the most respectable profession in any society. It is believed as the best job in the world. Any institute gives optimum results only when its human resources are utilized effectively. A teacher is the most important factor that not just works as a mentor and trainer for getting an education but inculcates morals and transforms conscience. The current education system is particularly aimed at increasing the student’s attainment, but teacher well-being is ignored or not considered essential to take care of. If a teacher has poor health and experience high levels of stress, he will not perform well at the workplace and do not make the best of their ability. The psychological well-being of a teacher can influence the ability of the teaching methods used by him in his teaching. Therefore, it is important to identify those factors that can enhance the well-being of teachers. This research is undertaken to find the effect of resilience in explaining the relationship of spiritual intelligence and psychological well being among teachers. To achieve this aim, a sample of 200 teachers (100 male teachers and 100 female teachers) within the age range of 25-40 years from different schools of Haryana was selected. The teachers’ well-being was assessed with the Scale developed by Ryff (1989), spiritual intelligence by David king (2008) Resilience Scale by Wagnild and Young (1987). Linear Regression analysis revealed that resilience predicts psychological well-being among teachers in a significant way. This shows that teachers who were resilient reported higher levels of psychological well-being.
