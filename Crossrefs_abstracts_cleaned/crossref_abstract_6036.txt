Introduction: Irreparable accidents, occupational diseases, and damage to the environment occur annually in the cement industry. Therefore, to minimize the risks, pay attention to the health of employees, and protect the environment, this study was conducted with the aim of “investigating the status of HSEE management system and resilience engineering in the cement industry".
Method: This was a descriptive study with the participation of 182 employees from a cement industry in Iran. They were selected according to random sampling and Cochran's formula. For this purpose, resilience engineering and HSEE questionnaire were reviewed and localized according to the studies and opinions of HSE and cement industry experts. Then, the status of HSEE management system and resilience engineering was reviewed. All analyzes were performed by one-sample t-test method using SPSS version 18 software.
Results: The results of this study indicated that the average of dimensions of resilience engineering and the dimensions of health, safety, environment, and ergonomics management system are lower than the standard score. Moreover, reporting has the highest average (4.72) among the dimensions of resilience engineering and the environment has the highest average (4.76) among the dimensions of the HSEE management system. 
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that by examining the status of resilience engineering and HSEE management system, authorities can improve the performance of HSE management system using the concept of resilience engineering .This is done with proper planning of resilience engineering indicators to strengthen the performance of HSE management system. To improve the level of resilience, every effort should be made to change the horizons of senior management in order to value HSE issues and accept them as a value in the organization.
