AbstractA simple evaluation method of building resilience is proposed, and the resilience of elastic‐plastic high‐rise buildings is evaluated under resonant long‐duration ground motions. The concept of availability is incorporated into the evaluation model of the building resilience, which was proposed in the previous paper. Not only in‐building components but also external factors such as lifelines and redundancy of facility systems are considered in the evaluation model. Based on the evaluation model, the following probabilistic indices are formulated: (1) the expected value of the total recovery time, (2) the expected values of the availability of the structural frame, facilities, and non‐structural components just after an earthquake event, and (3) the maximum likelihood recovery curves (MLRCs) of the structural frame, facilities, and non‐structural components. Numerical examples are presented for evaluating the resilience of elastic‐plastic high‐rise building models under a pseudo‐multi impulse (PMI), which substitutes for resonant long‐duration ground motions. Finally, the influences of the passive viscous dampers, the redundancy of facility systems, and the uncertainty of manpower to repair the components on the building resilience are clarified through the results of numerical examples.
