Abstract
To investigate how high-intensity exercise influences an athlete's myocardial resilience and the correlation between myocardial resilience and markers of myocardial ischemic injury.
Fifteen swimmers participated in high-intensity exercises. Cardiac ultrasound was performed before and after exercise on each subject. Left ventricular general strain, systolic general strain rate, and the differences (▴general strain and ▴ general strain rate, respectively), before and after exercise were analyzed. Blood was collected at the morning of the exercise day and 6 hours after exercise to measure cardiac enzyme indicators.
The correlation between myocardial resilience and markers of myocardial injury were evaluated. Most cardiac enzymes concentrations increased after exercise (P < .05). Cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB, and cardiac troponin T were all correlated with the degree of ▴ peak strain (differential value of posterior wall basal segment before and after exercise) and ▴ peak strain rate (differential value before and after exercise) (P < .05).
After high-intensity exercise, the concentrations of creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin T in the blood are positively correlated with two-dimensional ultrasound deformation indices, proving the fact that the seindices can be used as a diagnostic basis for myocardial injury, and are more sensitive than general strain. The two-dimensional strain echocardiogram is non-invasive and easily accepted by the patient. It can make up for the shortage of myocardial enzymes in the injury areas, including weak timeliness and the inability to locate injury.
