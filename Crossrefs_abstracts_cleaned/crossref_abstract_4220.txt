In Japan, the Goal of Carbon Neutral in 2050 was declared by Prime Minister in October, 2020. In order to achieve the goal, the Japanese government positioned Renewable Energy Source (RES) such as PV and wind power as ‘main power supply resource’ and is expanding its introduction by taking various types of countermeasures to solve the problems induced by massive integration of the RES into the grid. In recent years, the power system was damaged many times by a lot of natural disaster such as strong earthquakes, typhoons and heavy rains. The situation of the Japanese power system is drastically changing due to low demand growth, massive introduction of the RES as well as evolution of the power system reform that is introduction of power markets such as energy spot market, capacity market and balancing market. In this paper, our activities toward deregulated, smart and resilient power systems are presented. © 2022 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.
