The concept of supply chain resilience has arisen in response to changing conditions in the global market environment. Although supply chain resilience building is gaining increasing interest among the professional public and business practice, supporting decision-making in supply chain resilience building is still in its infancy. This article aims to present a mathematical model of the supply chain based on Markov chains to assess the impact of funds allocated to strengthening the supply chainâ€™s resilience to its overall performance and thus support decision-making in the field. Mathematical model assumptions are presented, then a mathematical model of a linear supply chain is developed and generalized, tested and methodological recommendations are presented. To support the use of the model, a set of managerial implications is presented, benefits and limitations are discussed, and further research direction is defined.
