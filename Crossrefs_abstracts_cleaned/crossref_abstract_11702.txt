 This study aims to examine the associations among social support, coping styles, and resilience in parents of children with orofacial clefts (OFCs). We conducted a cross-sectional study. Through convenience sampling, 306 parents of children with OFCs completed questionnaires on social support, coping styles, and resilience. Pearsonâ€™s correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the relationships among the selected variables. The results showed that age, gender, educational level, diagnosis of children, severity of OFCs, social support, and positive coping style had significant associations with resilience, which jointly explained 69.1% of the total variance in resilience. The findings suggested that social support and a positive coping style may be instrumental in improving resilience. Further research is required to explore interventions to improve the resilience of parents of children with OFCs.
