Due to an uncertain business environment caused by natural and man-made operational disruptions, operational resilience is gaining importance. This is especially true for companies whose competitive advantage relies on operational efficiency. This research aims to determine if operational resilience, operational disruption, operational efficiency, and firm competitive advantage are linked. Responses were collected from 266 industry professionals. According to the study, operational resilience does not affect operational efficiency, but it does affect a firm's competitive advantage. Operational disruptions affect operational efficiency but not a company's competitive edge. This research also reveals that operational efficiency has no impact on the link between operational resilience and competitive advantage. This research will help organizations to raise their competitive edge, which is a key measure of performance. This will be done while considering operational interruption events and operational resiliency resources. This research will aid organizations to understand the importance of these variables to get a competitive advantage for their growth and survival.
