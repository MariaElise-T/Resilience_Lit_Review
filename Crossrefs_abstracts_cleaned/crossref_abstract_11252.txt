Climate change is affecting all habitats and faucets of life, rural as well urban environs. Urban localities are the main contributors to global warming due to the carbon emissions released through human intervention in the climate system. City dwellers also become the victims of climate change and natural vagaries, Climate change disasters. In order to reduce these risks, cities have adopted strategies to enhance their resilience to climate change disasters and to create resilience. In this context, the United Nations has adopted several legal tools, most notably the Framework Convention on Climate Change. However, these tools have not been effective due to the minimal role of the organizations responsible. Also, the inability of major nations to meet their obligations in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions constitutes a primary contributor to the hazards endangering the survival of urban habitants. The aim of the research study was also to demonstrate the impact of resilience in reducing climate change and mitigating its effects, thereby increasing the elasticity of the environmental system. Keywords: Environment, climate change, resilience, disasters mitigation and adaptation.
