AbstractThe Dutch elm disease (DED) pathogens, Ophiostoma ulmi (Buisman) Nannf. and the more aggressive Ophiostoma novo-ulmi Brasier, have decimated European elm populations in the last 100 years. Today, the number of tolerant elm varieties available on the market is limited, partly due to the long breeding cycles and expensive facilities they require. Developing a low-cost technique to allow early screening of elm tolerance based on simple morphological and/or biochemical traits would considerably boost elm breeding and research. Within this general aim, we developed an in vitro plant culture system to (i) characterize stress responses to O. novo-ulmi-root inoculation in two Ulmus minor Mill. clones of contrasting susceptibility level to DED (termed ‘tolerant’ and ‘susceptible’) and (ii) compare the upward dispersal rate of the pathogen in the two clones. Constitutive xylem anatomy was similar in both clones, indicating that differences in plant responses to the pathogen are not attributable to anatomical factors (e.g., conduit size). Susceptible plantlets suffered a significant delay in apical growth and a decrease in chlorophyll content at 21 days post-inoculation (dpi). The rate of pathogen dispersal from roots to aerial tissues was similar in both clones. However, the tolerant clone showed a marked increase in lipid peroxidation at 1 dpi, while the susceptible clone showed enhanced values of lipid peroxidation during most of the experimental period (1–21 dpi). Despite wide stem colonization by the pathogen, the tolerant clone effectively regulated the oxidative stress levels and showed remarkable resilience to inoculation. These results extend current knowledge on elm defense mechanisms, and the proposed in vitro plant culture system emerges as a promising early screening method for tolerance to improve elm breeding.
