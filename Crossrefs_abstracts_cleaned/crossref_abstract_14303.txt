Abstract. In every field concerning post-disaster reconstruction, not only in engineering, technology plays a leading role and, just as resilience, it has become the goal that every action should achieve. In light of what has been claimed, this paper intends to critically illustrate one of the most interesting elements of technological innovation underway in the city of L'Aquila hit by the 2009 earthquake. The reference is the so-called "smart tunnel", a system of functional and management rationalization of the underground services of the city. The work was divided into two portions called "Excerpts" where the first one is currently 93% completed and highlighted the presence of intrinsic criticalities in the work and in the context. In order to avoid irrational and random conditions that could inevitably lead to a safety lack, related to the excerpts II a methodology is being developed, based on District Information Modeling. It is configured as a control and management tool for the whole system which will allow the interference management inspired by principles of rationality and safety. The smart tunnel system is part of a series of other public and private initiatives, aimed at a widespread experimentation of advanced technologies that deals with the renewal of infrastructures, services and mobility, telecommunications. These innovations mainly concern the Lâ€™Aquila historical centre but also the outskirts and follow the principles of the smart city and related to the resilience development.
