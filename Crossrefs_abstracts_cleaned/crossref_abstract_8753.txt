For purpose of saving energy and avoiding injuries, foam composite with excellent resilience property was successfully prepared consisting of inflame-retarding nonwoven, spacer fabric and PU/additive foam. Effects of foam density, additives (vermiculite, perlite) content and opening ratio of spacer fabric on resilience rate were explored respectively. Experimental result shows that 50 kg/m3foam density of PU foam had the lower resilience rate when containing 10 wt%-20 wt% vermiculites. Perlite P2 addition produced optimal resilience property comparing other types of additives in PU foam. Resilience rate decreased with increase of opening ratio of spacer fabric when containing 5 wt% additions.
