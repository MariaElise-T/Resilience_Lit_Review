Abstract
Pauline scholars have long analysed the Jerusalem collection described in 1 Cor 16:1–4, 2 Cor 8–9 and Rom 15:25–29 to unveil Paul’s motivations, but only recently have they considered the economic implications and ramifications of the long-distance gift. Some have tried to associate the long-distance gift with several socio-economic contexts, such as economic inequality, prevalent poverty, patronage and/or gift exchange. This article, however, brings economic fluctuations to the fore to explicate 2 Cor 8:1–15 (esp. vv. 10–15), arguing that Paul’s chief rhetorical inducement to the Corinthians is the practical benefit of increasing their long-term resilience and survivability against the mutable economies facing most ordinary people through balanced exchanges among those of various economic statuses.
