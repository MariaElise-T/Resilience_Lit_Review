Abstract.  In view of the increasing wheel loads of agricultural vehicles, the question arises as to whether soil can recover from the mechanical impact of traffic. The damage to soil quality depends also on the soils resilience. This paper presents a new approach to monitoring vertical soil movement in situ. We assessed the effects of trafficking the soil with excavators and sugarbeet harvesters by monitoring surface and subsurface levels. The caterpillar loads of the crawlers varied from 13 to 19 t, the wheel loads of the sugarbeet harvesters from 6 to 11 t. Classical geodetic levelling was used to record soil surface movement and a hydrostatic settlement meter measured deformation at three depths within the soil profile. The results of three field tests prove the importance of wheel load and soil moisture for soil compaction. Trafficking very dry soil with an excavator did not cause significant plastic deformation in 30 cm depth. Conversely, trafficking wet soil with a sugarbeet harvester led to soil sinkage of 1 to 2 cm even at 60 cm depth. Increased wheel load in subsequent passes led to greater subsidence than during the first pass. Settlement decreased from the soil surface to deeper layers, but it remained throughout the monitoring period of up to 12 days. No soil recovery from plastic deformation was recorded within this time. The measuring system has the potential for long‚Äêterm monitoring of the mechanical recovery of the soil. Additionally, it can contribute to the validation of mechanical impact models, which are based on soil stresses.
