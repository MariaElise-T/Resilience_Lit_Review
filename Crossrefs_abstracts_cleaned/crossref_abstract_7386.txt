The sudden new crown pneumonia epidemic at the end of 2019 greatly impacted people's productive lives, and communities, as grassroots units of national and urban functioning, played an important role in the prevention and control of this epidemic. Therefore, how to enhance the resilience and recovery capacity of communities against public health emergencies and strengthen community resilience will be an inevitable requirement for normalized prevention and control in the post-epidemic era. Focusing on the study of micro-community resilience, this paper explores the relationship between social capital, knowledge sharing, placeÂ attachment and community resilience respectively, and explores the paths and mechanisms of the influence of the three on community resilience. This study used a questionnaire survey method, correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis on the collected data to empirically test the interrelationship between social capital, knowledge sharing, place attachment and community resilience. The results showed that social capital, knowledge sharing, and place attachment all positively influenced community resilience.
