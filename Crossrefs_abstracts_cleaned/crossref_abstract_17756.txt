Introduction
The broaden and build theory of positive emotions maintains that positive emotions serve to broaden individualsâ€™ thoughts and behaviours, resulting in the accrual of resources (e.g. resilience) that catalyze upward spirals of well-being. However, there is a relative dearth of research examining the upward spiral hypothesis in the context of adolescence.


Methods
Adolescents (n = 4064) in participating Canadian high schools were surveyed annually for three years as part of the COMPASS study. Reciprocal associations between positive emotions and resilience were examined as predictors of flourishing.


Results
Adolescents who experienced positive emotions more frequently than usual reported higher levels of resilience one year later. Similarly, adolescents who had higher levels of resilience than usual reported more positive emotions the following year. Higher than usual levels of resilience and positive emotions positively predicted flourishing.


Conclusion
Positive emotions result in a cascade of beneficial outcomes including increased resilience and enhanced well-being, catalyzing an upward spiral towards flourishing. Opportunities to enhance positive emotions early on in adolescence may help build resources that can set students on the path towards increased well-being.
