Within the framework of this article, the author continued analytical work on developing a methodology for
statistical assessment and analysis of economic resilience indices, in particular, a methodology for regional detailing of
the economic resilience index was developed. The implementation of methodological provisions is based on solving two
interrelated problems. The first – accounting task – is aimed at creating a step-by-step algorithm for assessing the index
for territories at the subnational level. The second - analytical task - is an information and analytical tool for assessing
the contribution of economic resilience of regions to the index for the country as a whole.
