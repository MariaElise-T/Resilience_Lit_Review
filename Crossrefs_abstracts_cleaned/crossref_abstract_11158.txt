The current study examined the reciprocal association between psychological resilience, physical activity, and self-rated health in older America adults. A 3-wave cross-lagged panel design was employed using data sampled from the Health and Retirement Study 2010, 2014, and 2018. In total, 8380 older adults, age ranged between 56 and 95 years at the baseline (mean age = 68.06, SD = 7.77), were analyzed. Using structural equation modeling, standardized path coefficients were estimated to determine the relationship between physical activity, self-rated health, and psychological resilience across 2 follow-up points. Cross-lagged analysis revealed that higher levels of physical activity at T1 and T2 were significantly associated with higher levels of self-rated health at T2 and T3, respectively. Self-rated health at T1 and T2 were significantly associated with physical activity at T2 and T3, respectively. Self-rated health and psychological resilience were positively related to one another at each time point. However, relationship between physical activity and psychological resilience was complex across time. Study findings support reciprocal prospective relationship between physical activity and self-rated health and the relationship between self-rated health and psychological resilience.
