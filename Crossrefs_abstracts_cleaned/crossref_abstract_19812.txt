Originality/value
This study considers the Vietnamese textile industry to assess the indirect effect of inbound logistics on supply chain resilience through dynamic supply chain capabilities in a theoretical sense while assisting managers in comprehending the functions of supply chain collaboration, agility and reengineering as the foundation for supply chain resilience in a managerial sense.
