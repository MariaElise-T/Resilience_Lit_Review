Existing gaps in research, highlighting the varying resilience of economies to crises and shocks, limit the scope for designing policies for long- and short-term growth. There is a need for new researches in the context of a large-scale Russian-Ukrainian crisis. This article studies the reactions of the border and internal Russian regions to the largest shock in recent years, associated with a special military operation and large-scale sanctions. Representative publications declared that the Russian economy is resilient to sanctions. Our research reveals regional aspects of the short-term response of the Russian economy. Systematization of the main indicators of employment, standard of living, economy allowed to cover the main characteristics of socio-economic development of the region. Scientific novelty is achieved by new data on inter-group and intra-group differences of border and internal Russian regions. The practical significance of the study lies in the possibilities of applying the obtained results to work out policies that take into account the differences between border and internal regions.
