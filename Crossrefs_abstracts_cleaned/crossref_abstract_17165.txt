Urban vitality is the quality and the intensity of human activity within the urban space that represents the liveliness and the energy of cities. The spread of COVID-19 and the enforcement of social distancing policies have drastically reduced urban human activities and impacted the local economy, which has brought attention to the concept of urban resilience against COVID-19. Urban resilience can be understood as the capacity of a cityâ€™s systems to endure a crisis, minimize the impact of a crisis, and recover to a normal state from a crisis. The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively assess the levels of resilience of communities in Seoul, South Korea, using the social-ecological resilience model and the resistance-recovery ratio. The proposed framework for measuring resilience identifies the communities' capacity to resist the crisis, recover, and adapt to the recovered state, which provides a comprehensive understanding of urban resilience after COVID-19.
