Personal, academic and clinical factors are the main stressors for nursing undergraduates. This study aimed to assess stress, resilience and associated factors among nursing undergraduates. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing undergraduates at one university in Sri Lanka. A self-administered questionnaire including demographics, Perceived Stress Scale and Resilience Scale for Adults was used. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-test, ONE WAY ANOVA and binary logistic regression model. This study found that 38% of undergraduates had a high level of stress and the majority had a moderate level of resilience (76.7%). The mean total resilience score (RS) was 102.4 (±5.53). “Not getting expected marks” adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 5.56, 95 % CI=1.37-22.6) and “not satisfied with the academic program” (AOR 4.87, 95 % CI=1.27-8.76) were found to be the factors for having a high-stress score. Statistically significant median RS differences were observed: “Perception of Self” with grade point average (p=0.02) and recreational activities (p=0.04), and “Perception of future” with gender (p=0.04), the physical well-being (p=0.03) and recreational activities (p=0.04) and “Structural style” with the academic year (p=0.03). Influencing factors on stress and resilience need to be taken into account for organising academic programs for nursing undergraduates.
