The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chain operations globally. Nevertheless, resilient firms have the capacity to combat an unprecedented situation with the right strategic approach. The current research has developed an integrated research model that combines factors such as supply chain intelligence, supply chain communication, leadership commitment, risk management orientation, supply chain capability and network complexity to investigate supply chain resilience. The research model of this study was empirically tested with 309 responses collected from supply chain managers. Results revealed that supply chain resilience is measured with supply chain intelligence, supply chain communication, leadership commitment, risk management orientation, supply chain capability and network complexity and demonstrated a substantial variance R2 of 0.548% towards supply chain resilience. Practically, this study suggests that supply chain managers should focus on factors such as big data analytics, risk management orientation,1 supply chain communication and leadership commitment to enhance supply chain resilience and sustainable supply chain performance.
