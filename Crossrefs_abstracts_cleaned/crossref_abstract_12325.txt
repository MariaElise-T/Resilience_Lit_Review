 e18510  Background: Cancer patients' resilience influences treatment outcomes, but how community resilience at the ecological level affects hospitals that provide chemotherapy is poorly understood. Methods: Agency for Health Care Research and Quality 2019 ecological data were analyzed (N=3,232 counties). The number of hospitals with chemotherapy services (continuous) was the outcome. The exposure was community resilience- individuals who live with various risk factors (income-poverty ratio, crowding, communication barrier, household unemployment, disability, age 65+; no health insurance, vehicle access, and broadband internet access). Covariates included residential racial segregation-dissimilarity index- degree to which non-white and white residents were distributed across counties, scored 0-100 (integration-segregation) and income inequality scored 0-1 (equality-inequality), recategorized as 10th (low-risk), 11th-89th (moderate-risk), and 90th (high-risk) percentiles and rural-urban and region. Using STATA/MPv.17, descriptive, chi-square; adjusted negative binomial regression were performed adjusting for population weight. P-values â‰¤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Chemotherapy services were available in 38.4% of counties. The adjusted model reveals that chemotherapy availability decreased in high-risk than in low-risk resilient areas (Coef.: -1.10, 95% CI: -1.34 - -0.86), but increased in rural than in urban areas (Coef.: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.61- 0.49). Conclusions: Chemotherapy services rose in rural than urban areas and services were less likely to be provided when community resilience was low. [Table: see text]
