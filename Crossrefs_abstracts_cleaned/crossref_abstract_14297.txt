New nurses seem unable to find a means of flourishing professionally in acute care practice and, consequently, exit far earlier than expected. Worldviews of baccalaureate students have changed from previous generations; yet, the approaches to nursing education remain essentially the same. Just as clinical settings benefit from nursing theory as the basis for nursing practice and scientific inquiry, the science of nursing education would benefit from nursing theory as a basis for guiding educational practice. Parse's human science theory, the Human Becoming School of Thought, is a fitting theoretical framework for a model of teaching-learning for undergraduate baccalaureate nursing education. In addition, as a theory of dynamic relational synchrony, Parse's work provides an appropriate framework with which to promote professional resilience and career longevity by purposefully engaging students within student-faculty dyads to explore personal meanings and philosophies of caring, and to create strong professional identities.
