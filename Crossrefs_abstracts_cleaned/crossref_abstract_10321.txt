Climate change-induced disasters are increasing in intensity and frequency in the United States. Infant feeding in the aftermath of an extreme event is particularly challenging, especially given large variations in community vulnerability and resilience. The aim of this study was to identify the physical, social, and spatial vulnerabilities of communities along the Gulf Coast and highlight locations where high (or low) breastfeeding initiation rates have the potential to offset (or exacerbate) infant feeding challenges in the wake of a disaster. We structured this study as a retrospective, spatial data analysis of breastfeeding initiation, the risk for extreme events, social vulnerability, and community resilience to uncover locations that may need post-disaster intervention. The results suggested that significant gaps in the geographic distribution of community risk, vulnerability, resilience, and breastfeeding initiation existed. While many metropolitan areas benefitted from high breastfeeding initiation rates, they were also the most “at risk” for disasters. Conversely, many rural communities faced less risk for extreme events but exhibited more social vulnerability and less resilience should a disaster strike. Prioritizing emergency response resources to support infant feeding after a disaster is critically important, but urban and rural communities have divergent profiles that will require variable strategies to ensure recovery. Our results highlight this variability and provide prescriptive guidance regarding where to potentially allocate emergency resources.
