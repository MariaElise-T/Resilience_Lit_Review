In the digital world, the crypto currency has to do with the use of tokens based on the distributed ledger technology in a secure manner. Crypto currency can be a resource on a block chain network or can be seen as a tool to perform the transactions ensuring the privacy and security. Data may be available in temporal or text format. This paper describes about the distributed architecture for secure and attack-resilient bit coin-based crypto currency transactions for classified temporal and text data. The temporal data may be voice, sound or graphical information basing on the time series. If the data available is temporal this work describes about how it can be classified into a processed form. In this context, this paper describes the process of converting temporal data into text data. Further, the paper describes about the process of ensuring the security. This paper describes about the methodologies of cryptography-based hashing, attack-resilient nonce generation and verifiable encryption techniques for the construction of resilient transactions against stealthy data-integrity attack.
