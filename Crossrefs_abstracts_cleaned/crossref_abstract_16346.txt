ObjectiveTo explore whether biological rhythm disturbance mediates the association between perceived stress and depressive symptoms and to investigate whether ego resilience moderates the mediation model.MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out using an online self-report questionnaire distributed to college students from September 2021 to October 2021. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Severity (PSS-10), the Biological Rhythms Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), and Ego Resilience (ER-96) were used for investigation. SPSS 23 was used for data analyses. The significance of mediation was determined by the PROCESS macro using a bootstrap approach.ResultsAmong the participants, 9.2% (N = 1,282) exhibited significant symptoms of depression. Perceived stress was positively associated with depressive symptoms, and biorhythm partially mediated this relationship. The direct and indirect effects were both moderated by ego resilience. Perceived stress had a greater impact on depressive symptoms and biorhythm for college students with lower ego resilience, and the impact of biorhythm on depressive symptoms was also stronger for those with lower ego resilience. Perceived stress had an impact on depressive symptoms directly and indirectly via the mediation of biorhythm.ConclusionSchools and educators should guide college students to identify stress correctly and provide effective suggestions to deal with it. Meanwhile, maintaining a stable biorhythm can protect college students from developing depressive symptoms. Students with low resilience should be given more attention and assistance.
