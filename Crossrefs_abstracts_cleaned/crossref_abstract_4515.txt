 This commentary responds to the proposal for geographers to engage in debating the ontological politics of resilience multiple. An examination of how resilience is (multiply) deployed and enacted at points of articulation provides a means by which to politicize the proliferation of resilience interventions and to comprehend the world-making effects of resilience practices. In considering how resilience practices make (different) worlds, in this commentary, I review two particular, situated contexts in Aotearoa New Zealand to investigate how resilience multiple hangs together.
