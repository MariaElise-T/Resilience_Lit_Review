 Bereavement is considered one of the most stressful experiences that young people face, and there are unique considerations for how this impacts college students. Applying a resilience framework to the experiences of bereaved college students can provide a better understanding of their experiences; however, studies on the ways that these individuals themselves define resilience are extremely limited. Furthermore, no studies to date have considered the intersection between college studentsâ€™ conceptualizations of resilience and the developmental features of emerging adulthood. The authors present the results of a grounded theory study in which 51 bereaved college students completed a questionnaire and 10 were interviewed to identify the age-salient tasks that they use to define resilience. Three primary themes were identified related to resilience: (a) emotional indicators, (b) behavioral indicators, and (c) fixed and/or unidentifiable factors. Findings were analyzed to reveal the bidirectional impact between grief and the developmental features of emerging adulthood.
