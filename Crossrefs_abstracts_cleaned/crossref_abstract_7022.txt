 With the increasing number of AIDS orphans worldwide, the negative impact of HIV/AIDS-related stigma on AIDS orphans has raised researchers' concerns. Various stigma-enacted stigma, overt discrimination, and internalized stigma were found to contribute to harming the phycological well-being of AIDS orphans. Therefore, the study of resilience in AIDS orphans that provides buffering against stigma experiences is necessary and crucial. Hence, field observation of organization X, an AIDS orphanage supported by an NGO, is employed to investigate the benefits and approaches utilized by NGOs in the enhancement of AIDS orphans’ resilience. An interview with a staff member at organization X further completes the understanding of NGO supports and their impacts on AIDS orphans. It has been found that NGOs, macro-level resilience resources for AIDS orphans, promise basic survival supplies providing optimal physiological state, laying the foundation for education and other higher needs. The feeling of belonging and peer support within organization X allows AIDS orphans to support and become each other’s resilience resources. Moreover, educational approaches employed by NGOs help AIDS orphans to accept their illnesses and increase confidence, preparing AIDS orphans for social integration. All of these approaches were used by organization X, yielding a 90% social integration successful rate among their fostered AIDS orphans. However, private non-enterprise units such as organization X are facing financial difficulties and need governmental support, increased publicity, and structural improvement.
