OBJECTIVES
This study explored the assessment of resilience at work among 1st-line nurse managers (NMs).


BACKGROUND
Resilience is the ability to cope with stress. NMs have stressful roles and may ultimately withdraw from management if they lack resilient behaviors. Having a measurement of resilience at work in NMs and other healthcare workers may facilitate resilience development approaches.


METHODS
In a descriptive, cross-sectional design, an electronic survey of 25-item, 7-subscale Resilience at Work (RAW) self-report assessment was distributed to 77 NMs.


RESULTS
The highest reported subscale was living authentically; lowest was maintaining perspective. Total years as NM was related to overall RAW mean, maintaining perspective, staying healthy.


CONCLUSION
The application of an instrument to determine resilience may focus support for NMs on maintaining perspective, for example. Further study exploring the application of the RAW assessment to healthcare workers is indicated.
