Earthquake early warning (EEW) is becoming a popular tool for mitigating earthquake‐induced losses. However, the current literature separates EEW technical components and their operational and behavioural implications. This paper investigates how EEW can be integrated into business continuity practices, organisational resilience, and disaster risk reduction (DRR). A mixed methods approach is applied to analyse EEW perceptions in the case‐study context of Mexico City, Mexico, which is characterised by a high level of seismic hazard and social and physical exposure/vulnerability. The dataset includes evidence from 15 semi‐structured interviews with representatives of the public and private sectors, such as governments and enterprises, and 78 valid questionnaires compiled by local organisations, including civil protection and education institutions. The results reveal inconsistencies between technical EEW methodologies and their integration into three core domains of organisational practice: accountability, governance, and jurisdiction; standardisation of plans and procedures; training and education. Finally, open challenges for future research are highlighted.
