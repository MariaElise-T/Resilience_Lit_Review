The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economic, public and emotional health of our society, with the more vulnerable intersectionalities of our society being more severely impacted. Older adults faced greater risk of death by Covid-19 and long-term health complaints following infection. Moreover, pre-existing generational factors such as social isolation and difficulties accessing support were exaggerated during the pandemic. The current study used qualitative enquiry to explore the experiences of older adults during the first UK lockdown by interviewing 13 older adults already accessing mental health services. Five superordinate themes emerged from the data: (1) impact on mental health, including depression and anxiety, (2) restrictions, including ways of staying safe, frustration and indifference, (3) experiencing loss, such as loss of life, activities, connection, independence and stability, (4) coping with it, referring to support from others, developing routines, finding safety strategies and activity, access to services and connection and loss, and (5) hopes for the post pandemic world, including changes in values and priorities, resuming travel and activity. Although the data highlights the difficulties and struggles experienced by the sample of older adults, it also draws attention to the resilience and type of support required. This understanding can help inform our interactions and formulation of older adults within mental health services following the pandemic while keeping their stories and meaning in mind as we find ways to support them.
