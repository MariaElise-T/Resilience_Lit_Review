AbstractThis paper integrates a theoretical framework based on dynamic capabilities and relational perspective to provide a comprehensive understanding of the antecedents and outcomes of supply chain resilience. First, it discusses the antecedents of supply chain resilience and the internal relationships among antecedents combining dynamic capabilities and relational perspective. Second, it discusses the mechanism of supply chain resilience on sustainable operational performance (sustainable market performance and sustainable quality performance). Finally, based on organizational information processing theory, it proposes and explores the moderating effects of supply side disruption, facility disruption and catastrophic disruption on the relationship between supply chain resilience and sustainable operational performance. The conclusions enrich and develop the antecedents and outcomes of supply chain resilience, reveal the influencing factors of supply chain resilience from dynamic capabilities and relational perspective, and reveal the value of supply chain resilience to operational performance from the perspective of sustainability, providing a breakthrough for disruption mitigation strategies and enhance the confidence of managers in designing supply chain resilience; supply chain disruption types are included in the outcomes framework of supply chain resilience, which further provides theoretical guidance for enterprises to quickly recover normal operation from supply chain disruption shocks.
