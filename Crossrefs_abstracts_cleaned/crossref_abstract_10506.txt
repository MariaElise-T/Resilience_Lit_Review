Abstract
Date Presented 03/28/20
This qualitative study explored autistic adultsâ€™ definitions and descriptions of resilience through an online survey of open-ended questions via Qualtrics. Autistic adults were recruited from closed, online Facebook communities and Internet forums of autistic adults. Qualitative data was analyzed using grounded theory until saturation was reached. Multiple researchers and data collection from multiple sources ensured rigor, triangulation, and trustworthiness of the data.
