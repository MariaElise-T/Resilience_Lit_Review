Abstract

Background and Objectives
Caring for a person living with dementia requires resilience, the capacity to recover and grow from challenging situations. Despite the increasing interest in assessing and promoting resilience for dementia care partners, behaviors that indicate this attribute are not well known. The aim of this study was to synthesize the literature to identify resilience-related behaviors and develop a new framework for future validation and intervention research.


Research Design and Methods
We searched English-language peer-reviewed articles (January 1991–June 2019) reporting qualitative or quantitative descriptions of resilience-related behaviors among dementia care partners. Thematic analysis was used to categorize behaviors into domains, identify the relationships among them, and generate a thematic map.


Results
Sixteen articles were identified according to predefined inclusion criteria. Four domains emerged: (a) problem–response behaviors (problem-solving, problem-distancing); (b) self-growth behaviors (self-care activities, spiritual-related activities, and developing and maintaining meaningful social relationships); (c) help-related behaviors (help-seeking and help-receiving); and (d) learning-related behaviors (learning from others and reflection). Definitions of each domain, identification of corresponding behaviors, and formulation of Care Partner Resilience (CP-R) behavioral framework were informed by mixed research synthesis results and other relevant literature.


Discussion and Implications
The CP-R framework emerged as a result of a new focus on identifying and cultivating strengths instead of evaluating strain and burden. It serves as a useful foundation for understanding the impact of specific behaviors on dementia care partner resilience. Once validated, this framework will inform the development of future measures, research, interventions, and policies for dementia care partners.
