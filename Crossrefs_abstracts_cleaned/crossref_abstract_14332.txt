Temporary housing is immediate shelter needed after a disaster for the displaced people. A vast quantity of living quarters are required in a limited time and developed mainly by many different parties. Thus they had produced a wide range of qualities of the accommodation caused due to various considerations. After its initial period, countless transitory houses were still used for years and turned into permanent dwellings, yet others just left empty since the beginning. This paper examines how housing needs recovers and how shelters are resilient to the people in a post-disaster period. One hundred one samples of temporary refuge in Sigi after the 7.4 M Palu earthquake 2018 built by four influential organisations were examined its architectural properties and occupancy. The result shows that safety, comfort, and the expectation for permanent housing significantly determine the houses' success rate. The acceptability level is ensued from top to bottom as follows: the standalone unit with the user involvement; with the local resources; with the fixed package given; and the shared unit package, respectively.
