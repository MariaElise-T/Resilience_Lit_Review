Background: Resilience is a term used to describe an individualâ€™s adaptive coping following an adverse experience; it is important for gaining insight into the development of mental health difficulties in young people and their ability to manage adversity, informing both preventive and reactive clinical practice. Methods: The Delphi method was used whereby a panel of 15 clinical psychologists rated 67 statements, generated from focus groups with young people and interviews with multi-disciplinary staff, in terms of their importance relating to resilience for young people with complex mental health needs. A consensus level of 85% across the panel was set to include/exclude statements in terms of their importance for resilience. Results: Nineteen statements were included in the final list. These were grouped into the following four themes: (1) understanding the self, (2) agency in recovery, (3) interpersonal relationships and (4) therapeutic setting and relationships. Conclusions: The results highlight specific resilience factors for young people with complex mental health needs, based upon ratings by clinical psychologists. Recommendations are made which focus upon how to promote resilience within this specific population. These include offering secure therapeutic relationships and a safe environment for young people to make decisions, develop a greater understanding of themselves, and build relationships and a sense of connection with others, both within the specialist mental health service and upon discharge.
