Adolescents with high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are highly vulnerable to depressive symptoms (DS) and a range of mental health problems compared to their typically developing peers. It is not known whether resilience can influence DS in adolescents with high functioning ASD. This study sought to find out the link between resilience and DS in a sample of adolescents with high functioning ASD in Nigeria. The study is a quantitative correlation study of in-school adolescents with high functioning ASD. 68 adolescents with high functioning ASD from 20 inclusive education schools participated in the study. Data were collected using self report versions of Child and Youth resilience Measure (CYRM-SR) and Children&rsquo;s Depression Inventory second edition (CDI-2: SR). Findings showed that total resilience score is a strong negative predictor of DS in adolescents with high functioning ASD (B=-.93; &beta;=-.77; t=-4.20; p=.000). Specifically, individual capacities subscale (B=-2.20; &beta;=-.77;t=-8.39;p=.000), Primary caregivers resources subscale (B=-1.98; &beta;=-.69; t=-7.49; p=.000); and Contextual factors subscale (B=-2.02; &beta;=-.62; t=-8.38; p=.000) predicted overall depressive symptoms (Total DS score) negatively and significantly. It was concluded that DS among adolescents with high functioning ASD can be reduced through developing resilience skills among them. Parents, special Educators and all stakeholders should intensify efforts in building resilience in adolescents with high functioning ASD.
