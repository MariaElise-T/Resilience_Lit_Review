AbstractIntroductionThe brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) interacts with important genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors. Specifically, variants within the SORL1 gene determine BDNF's ability to reduce amyloid β (Aβ) in vitro. We sought to test whether functional BDNF variation interacts with SORL1 genotypes to influence expression and downstream AD‐related processes in humans.MethodsWe analyzed postmortem brain RNA sequencing and neuropathological data for 441 subjects from the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project and molecular and structural neuroimaging data for 1285 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.ResultsWe found one SORL1 RNA transcript strongly regulated by SORL1‐BDNF interactions in elderly without pathological AD and showing stronger associations with diffuse than neuritic Aβ plaques. The same SORL1‐BDNF interactions also significantly influenced Aβ load as measured with [18F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography.DiscussionOur results bridge the gap between risk and resilience factors for AD, demonstrating interdependent roles of established SORL1 and BDNF functional genotypes.
