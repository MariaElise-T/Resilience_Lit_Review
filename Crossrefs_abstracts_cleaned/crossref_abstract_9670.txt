Abstract
Environmental art design is a subject to deal with the relationship between artificial environment and natural environment, and also a subject to create a livable and ecological balanced living environment for human beings. Thus, it is of paramount of importance to study how artificial construction can adapt to the natural environment. To this end, the concept of physics “Resilience” is introduced into the landscape design of urban wetland park, and the strategies of shaping and utilizing resilience landscapes in urban wetland park is discussed in order to provide effective measures to deal with urban flood disaster, realize “sponge function”, promote regional ecological environment balance and sustainable development.
