Climate change is widely recognized as one of the most pressing issues confronting humanity today. It is considered to be a direct threat to our food production system including rice. Climate change affects rice production in various ways. The variability in temperature and precipitation increases, predictability of seasonal weather patterns reduces and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and cyclones increases. In India, the effect of natural disasters on agriculture, including disasters caused by climate change has been gradually growing. It is believed that during the mid and end century India's future rice production is projected to reduced by 2.5 to 5% from the current level. As there is less scope for rice area to grow in the future, any growth in rice production will have to come only from productivity gains. Since climate change is a continuous process, the rice production system requires specific adaptation strategies to prevent rice yield losses and its variability. Therefore, it's critical to understand how climate change affects rice crop and to follow better production practises including crop establishment methods, water management, weed management, nutrient management and microbial resources utilization that make cropping systems more resilient to extreme weather events. The spread of climate resilient production technologies would benefit rice production systems' resilience.
