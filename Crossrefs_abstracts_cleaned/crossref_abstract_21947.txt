AbstractAimTo explore the mediating role of post‐traumatic growth and perceived professional benefits between resilience and intent to stay among Chinese nurses to support Wuhan in managing COVID‐19.DesignA cross‐sectional questionnaire survey.MethodsIn May 2020, the study recruited a convenience sample of 200 Chinese nurses to support Wuhan in managing COVID‐19. A set of self‐rating questionnaires was used to measure resilience, post‐traumatic growth, perceived professional benefits and intent to stay. Structural equation modelling was performed with 5,000 bootstrap samples using AMOS 23.0.ResultsThe final model provided a good fit for the data. Resilience had the strongest direct effect on intent to stay. Perceived professional benefits partially mediated the association between resilience and intent to stay. Overall, the serial multiple mediations of post‐traumatic growth and perceived professional benefits in the relationship between resilience and intent to stay was statistically significant.
