The submergence of rice fields is a significant issue in India's rice production, which is further aggravated by the unpredictable monsoon rain patterns and the impact of climate change. Larger variation in rainfall patterns affected by the timing of nursery raising and transplanting later in the main field therefore, we adopted Climate Resilient Technology (CRT) for rice production, Extended seedbed durations for rice seedlings allow for adequate rainfall during the monsoon season. So that the experiment was conducted at 30 farmerâ€™s fields of NICRA village, Khana Bari, Kishanganj, Bihar, India, in 2022 under the supervision farm science Center, Kishanganj, the experiment was framed in randomized block design with ten replications. All plots received the recommended dose of fertilizers (120:60:40 kg ha-1 N.P.K.) in equal amounts. Urea, di-ammonium phosphate, and muriate of potash were used as the sources of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively. To determine the growth characters i.e., plant height (cm) at harvest stage, number of effective tillers hill-1, LAI, Chlorophyll concentration (SPAD) and days to 50 per cent flowering were recorded at 90 days. Yield attributes viz., After the completion of the harvest, various observations were recorded, such as the number of panicles/m2, the number of grains per panicle, the number of filled and unfilled grains per panicle, the test weight in grams, and the yield. This encompassed grain yield, straw yield, biological yield in quintals per hectare, and harvest index percentage. During the field experiment, both the climate-resilient technology Swarna Sub1 and Sabour Sampans paddy varieties were tested. Swarna Sub1 was found to be significantly superior in terms of plant growth, yield attributes, and yield characteristics. under submergence conditions. The significant maximum grain yield (48 q ha-1), straw yield (84 q ha-1), biological yield (153 q ha-1), and harvest index (45%) were recorded in Swarna Sub-1.
