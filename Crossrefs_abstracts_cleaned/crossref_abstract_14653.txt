Abstract
In order to build a resilient city, it is crucial to assess the current level of resilience as a baseline measurement. This study assesses the progress and status resilience building of Semarang City using a disaster resilience scorecard for cities developed by The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) at the preliminary level. The scorecard assesses disaster resilience by considering Ten Essentials for Making Cities Resilient, as an operational framework of Sendai framework for disaster reduction (2015 â€“ 2030), at the local level. The scorecard has 47 criteria, scoring between 0 to 3 where 0 is representing little or no awareness and 3 is representing full integration of disaster risk reduction (DRR). The finding shows that Semarang has an overall score of 69 out of 141. The analysis suggests that assign a budget for DRR and incentives to increase financial capacity, apply and enforce risk compliant building regulations and land use planning, invest and maintain critical infrastructure, and provide comprehensive post-event recovery plans needs to be improved and prioritized in disaster risk reduction toward a more resilient and safer city.
