PurposeThe purpose of this conceptual paper is to develop a model of the hypothesized relationships between investments and outcomes of resilient health care (RHC).Design/methodology/approachBased on the extant literature, the aforementioned model is described along with proxy measures of its composing variables and a matrix for assessing the cost-effectiveness of RHC instantiations. Additional possible relationships are set out in two propositions for theory testing.FindingsThe model conveys that RHC gives rise to both desired and undesired outcomes. Investments moderate the relationships between RHC and its outcomes. Both investments and outcomes can be broadly categorized as either human or technical. Moreover, the propositions refer to what type and how much investment is necessary to perform in a resilient manner, what are the intended or desired outcomes of RHC, for how long and who is affected by these outcomes.Originality/valueThe cost-effectiveness perspective of RHC is new and the proposed model opens opportunities for empirical and theoretical research.
