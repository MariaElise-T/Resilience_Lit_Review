With the global climate change, the frequency of extreme weather is getting higher and higher, and the threat to the safe operation of the power system is gradually increasing, which is likely to cause large-scale power outages and then result in N-k contingencies. Meanwhile, the Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC) based Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MTDC) power system has been confirmed that can provide the possibility for the network interconnection between regional power systems and various renewable energy resources to boost supply reliability and economy. To enhance the resilience of the power grid, a generation rescheduling scheme by optimal emergency control that considers the risk-based dynamic security constraint and reactive power constraints is proposed. Based on the transient stability criterion of the rotor angle speed of the center of inertia (COI), the active power is adjusted to improve the transient stability of the system. The usefulness of the proposed control strategy is highlighted on a 10-machine-39-bus hybrid power system built on MATMTDC, a MATLAB-based open-source software. The obtained results demonstrate that the state optimization control strategy is capable of enhancing the resilience of hybrid power systems and improving the transient stability when suffering N-k contingencies.
