This study explored the effects of grit on resilience and creative problem-solving in elementary science-gifted students. For this purpose, data were collected from 56 elementary science gifted students at a university-affiliated science gifted education center. The data were first subjected to descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, and then to multiple regression analysis with grit as the independent variable and resilience and creative problem solving as the dependent variables. The results of this study were as follows: First, the grit of elementary science gifted students was higher in perseverance of effort than consistency of interest and resilience was higher in all sub-factors. Second, perseverance of effort was more highly correlated with resilience than consistency of interest and was significantly predictive. In particular, the correlation with the self-regulation sub-factor of resilience was the highest, and the predictive power of the perseverance of effort on self-regulation was 81.6%. Third, grit did not correlate with creative problem-solving and did not show significant predictive power.
