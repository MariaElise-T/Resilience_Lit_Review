This study aims to enable a high level of coordination to cope with increasing levels of uncertainty by computing supplier- and network-based resilience values. Our case study is based on a real-world highly connected global manufacturing firm based in Korea as a test environment to evaluate a proposed bicriterion network resilience model using resilience and network values, together with an ordering approach. An outranking methodology is used to determine the improvement priorities of suppliers to achieve a high level of overall network resilience. The results show that the effectiveness of a firmâ€™s performance with respect to the entire supply chain may increase or decrease based on its embeddedness and connectivity within the supply network. This study is one of the first to provide an integrative (resilience capabilities and network attributes) approach to the supplier improvement model, future studies are encouraged to expand the model to different network settings.
