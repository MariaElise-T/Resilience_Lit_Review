 This paper describes how the city of Bandar Lampung began to incorporate climate change adaptation goals into its budget and some of its plans. A series of Shared Learning Dialogues supported by the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) involved staff from city government, NGOs and universities. This led to the formation of a multi-stakeholder City Team that was charged by the mayor with assessing climate risks and vulnerability, prioritizing problems and programmes, supporting small-scale adaptation projects and functioning as climate change adaptation advocates within the city. The paper describes some of these projects and how a range of factors underpinned better solid waste management and flood risk reduction, including fiscal reform that brought a large increase in the cityâ€™s budget, strong leadership and better planning. Challenges and barriers are also discussed, including what is needed to ensure that local government continues to incorporate climate change adaptation into its work and investments.
