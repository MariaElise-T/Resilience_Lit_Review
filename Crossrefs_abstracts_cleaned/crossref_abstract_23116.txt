AbstractSurvival response of the human tuberculosis pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to a diverse environmental cues is governed through its versatile transcription regulatory mechanisms with the help of a large pool of transcription regulators (TRs). Rv1830 is one such conserved TR, which remains uncharacterized in Mtb. It was named as McdR based on an effect on cell division upon its overexpression in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Recently, it has been implicated in antibiotic resilience in Mtb and reannotated as ResR. While Rv1830 affects cell division by modulating the expression of M. smegmatis whiB2, the underlying cause of its essentiality and regulation of drug resilience in Mtb is yet to be deciphered. Here we show that ResR/McdR, encoded by ERDMAN_2020 in virulent Mtb Erdman, is pivotal for bacterial proliferation and crucial metabolic activities. Importantly, ResR/McdR directly regulates ribosomal gene expression and protein synthesis, requiring distinct disordered N-terminal sequence. Compared to control, bacteria depleted with resR/mcdR exhibit delayed recovery post-antibiotic treatment. A similar effect upon knockdown of rplN operon genes further implicates ResR/McdR-regulated protein translation machinery in attributing drug resilience in Mtb. Overall, findings from this study suggest that chemical inhibitors of ResR/McdR may be proven effective as adjunctive therapy for shortening the duration of TB treatment.
