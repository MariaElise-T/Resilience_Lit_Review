Fault tolerance and the availability of applications, computing infrastructure, and communications systems during unexpected events are critical in cloud environments. The microservices architecture, and the technologies that it uses, should be able to maintain acceptable service levels in the face of adverse circumstances. In this paper, we discuss the challenges faced by cloud infrastructure in relation to providing resilience to applications. Based on this analysis, we present our approach for a software platform based on a microservices architecture, as well as the resilience mechanisms to mitigate the impact of infrastructure failures on the availability of applications. We demonstrate the capacity of our platform to provide resilience to analytics applications, minimizing service interruptions and keeping acceptable response times.
