Purpose: The aim of the research was to analyze the drought hazard occurrence, perceptional differences among residents to drought hazard occurrence, and explore the resilience mechanisms at household, community level, and institutional level to recover from drought hazards
 
Theoretical framework: The research dealt with the theoretical aspects of how hazards occurrence can be observed through the perceptional differences of the residents in a particular area. Adoption of short- and long-term drought resilience mechanisms is inevitable to recover from drought hazards.
 
Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on exploratory research design. Four ‘kebeles’ were selected considering drought classifications and 200 respondents were chosen. Descriptive statistics, Timeline Approach and ANOVA were used to analyze the data collected.
 
Findings: Majority of respondents know about drought hazard occurrence, causes at their level, and experienced the effects of drought.  There are significant perceptional differences among respondents across educational and marital status, and monthly income.
 
Research, Practical & Social implications: Household and community participation is essential for adopting drought resilience mechanisms with the support of governmental and non-governmental agencies.
 
Originality/value: This Study focused on drought hazard occurrence and resilience mechanisms at household and community level to recover drought hazards. The originality / value of the study lies with perceptional differences on drought hazards occurrence using the Timeline approach and ANOVA. The findings of this study would contribute to design and implement effective drought resilience mechanisms.
