Abstract
The high number of dropout undergraduate students in Jakarta is interesting to link with academic resilience to see how far the ability to survive, overcome, and even develop amid difficulties. Some resilience studies have revealed a positive relationship with self-esteem, in which higher self-esteem relates to higher resilience and vice versa. Self-esteem is a strength that comes from within a person. According to some experts, the forming factor of resilience is self-efficacy. This research will examine the influence of these two factors in shaping academic resilience. The total number of respondents was 455 students studying at an A-accredited university in Jakarta. Most respondents were male as many as 234 people (51.3%), and the lowest respondents were female as many as 221 people (48.5%). The findings showed that self-esteem and self-efficacy simultaneously influenced 47.6% on academic resilience, while the remaining 52.4% influenced by other variables. The biggest effect was from self-efficacy as much as 39.8%. The effect of self-esteem on academic resilience was 28.5%. Suggestions for further research are to conduct self-efficacy interventions to improve studentsâ€™ academic resilience.
