AbstractWhat is needed for our children facing unprecedented challenges of modern time? Biodiversity, both for immunological and psychological well‐being and resilience. That is also the keyword for the children with allergies and asthma. The cultural evolution with advanced technology and medicine along with major move to urban environment has profoundly changed our lifestyle and surroundings. We are increasingly disconnected from our evolutionary home, soil, natural waters, and air we used to breathe. The ecosystem of human body and mind has been tested, survived, and evolved closely in relation with other ecosystems. For balance and tolerance, immune regulatory circuits need training by microbes, biogenic chemicals, and close relation to natural environment throughout life. This is addressed by the biodiversity hypothesis of tolerance/resilience for health, supported by the pioneering real‐world interventions and a few controlled studies. No need to go “back to nature,” but we must take natural elements back to our everyday life to breathe, eat, drink, and touch. The change for better is plausible and cost‐effective, as shown by the Finnish and other European initiatives, but needs contribution of the whole society.
