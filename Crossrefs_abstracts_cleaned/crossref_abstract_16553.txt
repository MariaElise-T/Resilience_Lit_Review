The study was conducted in the three North Eastern Hill (NEH) States of India viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya. Three district viz., East Siang, Bishnupur and East Khasi Hills were selected purposively based on the most vulnerable to climate change of the selected states respectively. A total of 257 vulnerable farmers were selected for the study. The study followed descriptive research design. The study testifi ed that majority of the farmers had ‘Adaptive Capacity’ of resilience to climate change while ‘Coping Strategies to Shocks’ was found very low among the farmers. Majority of the farmers belonged to medium level of ‘Resilience to Climate Change in Agriculture’. The farmers’ resilience to climate change had moderate to weak statistically signifi cant correlations with the independent variables of the study. The study suggest that the farmers need to be profi cient for strategies to Cope with climatic Shocks and need to enhance their Socio-economic capacity to deal with the shocks. For this, encouraging farmers to augur well in agriculture through application of suitable indigenous and scientifi c agricultural knowledge and techniques alongside the administration of Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) Practices in the agriculture and associated systems are needed
