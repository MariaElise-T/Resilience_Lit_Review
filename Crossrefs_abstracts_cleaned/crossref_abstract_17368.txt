 Understanding the qualities that are most important for employees’ career success has been fundamental in advancing career literature. Researchers, employers, and employees have shown an increased interest in the dynamics and factors involved in the relationship between career commitment and subjective career success. This study examined career commitment and subjective career success among South African veterinary professionals ( N  =  331), whilst exploring the possible moderating role of career resilience and self-efficacy. Empirical results showed significant positive relationships between career commitment, career resilience, self-efficacy, and subjective career success. Furthermore, results indicated that self-efficacy moderated the relationship between career commitment and subjective career success, although no evidence for the moderating role of career resilience in this regard, was found. These findings carry implications for organisations and training institutions on the qualities most important for the career success of veterinary professionals. Implementing career commitment initiatives and considering self-efficacy in the training of veterinary professionals are recommended.
