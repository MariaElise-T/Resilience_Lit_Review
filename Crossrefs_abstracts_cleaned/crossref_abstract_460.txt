In this article, cyber resilience is defined as the ability to withstand external shocks caused by cyber risks, recover from them, and adapt to them. The importance of building a cyber resilience system in modern conditions is emphasized and examples of emergency situations of cyberattacks are given. The need to ensure cyber resilience at facilities and institutions is considered, different types of threats aimed at different systems, as well as the consequences of their negative impact are highlighted.
It is noted that resilience and risk management, although interrelated, are still different. Risk management involves quantitative risk assessment, which forms a decision on the most appropriate strategy for responding to them. Resilience is important when risk is incalculable, when hazardous conditions are a complete surprise, or when analytical risk parameters have proven ineffective.
It is emphasized that at a fundamental level, there are certain disagreements about the true meaning of resilience: for some, it implies the ability of a system to withstand a shock and return to its initial state, while for others it is an evolutionary process leading to adaptation and a new state of balance.
Resilience has a long and rich history in various fields of scientific knowledge, including ecology, psychology, and disaster management. One of its main advantages is that it allows complex systems to prepare for adverse events and continue to operate under extraordinary conditions. It is concluded that the "prevent and protect‚Äù paradigm, which is still dominant today, is insufficient, and that risk management tools need to be developed in the direction of cyber resilience.
