 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased levels of stress and alcohol consumption. This study examined the effect of resilience on the relationship between stress and changes in alcohol consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. A cross-sectional survey of 502 adults in Queensland, Australia (mean age = 45.68 (16.61)), found 23.9% of individuals had increased their alcohol consumption since the start of the pandemic. Regression modelling demonstrated a significant association between perceived stress and change in alcohol consumption. The study also revealed resilience was a moderating factor, where high levels of resilience buffered against increases in alcohol consumption associated with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
