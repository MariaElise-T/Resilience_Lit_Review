Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) is very important to achieve long-term improvement in productivity and farm incomes under climate uncertainty. The present study focuses on investigating the plausible changes in the hydrometeorological conditions using big-data analysis techniques in the study of Ethiopia. The original contribution of this work envisages the importance of the CRA system in water-scarce areas for sustainable agriculture planning and management under changing climatic conditions. In the present research, a TerraClimate model was the basis for weather (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological data (runoff, actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit and climate water deficit); these data were used to determine the spatial distribution of the standardized anomaly index (SAI) and the slope of the linear regression for long-term (1958–2020) trend analysis. Future climate trend analysis (2021–2100) has been performed through the CMIP6 (EC-Earth3) shared socio-economic pathway (SSP 2) 4.5 dataset. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) with CSR and JPL data were utilized for the generation of water storage heat maps from 2002 to 2021. The results show that the average annual rainfall data for over 62 years was found to be 778.42 mm and the standard deviation is 81.53 mm. The results also show that the western part of the study area has the highest temperature trend, which diminishes as one moves eastward; the minimum temperature trend has been found in the western part of the study area. It was found that the equivalent water thickness (EWT) range of both CSR and JPL products was −15 to 40 cm. These results can help local climate-resilient development planning and enhance coordination with other institutions to access and manage climate finance.
