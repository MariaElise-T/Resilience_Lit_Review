ABSTRACT  Objective: to verify the association of socioeconomic and clinical data and behavioral habits with the resilience level in people with Diabetes Mellitus during social distancing in the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus disease.  Method: a cross-sectional, analytical and exploratory study. The population consisted of users monitored in the Family Health Strategy, diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus, in the municipality of Cuité, Paraíba, Brazil. The sample consisted of 300 participants. The data were collected between November 2020 and February 2021 and operationalized through two forms: one containing socioeconomic and clinical aspects, as well as behavioral habits; and another that was part of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale for Brazil, consisting of 25 items divided into four factors, namely: tenacity, adaptability, tolerance, dependence on external support, and intuition. In the bivariate analysis, the Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests were performed, and the prevalence ratio was calculated, along with the respective 95% confidence intervals. Finally, Poisson Regression with robust variance was applied.  Results: the prevalence of having high resilience levels was 43% higher in people under 60 years old, 39% higher in Evangelicals, 36% higher in people who consumed alcoholic beverages and 29% higher in people who practiced some physical activity.  Conclusion: an association was evidenced between socioeconomic/clinical data and behavioral habits and a high resilience level; such findings lead to the elaboration of inclusive actions during the pandemic, especially considering the emotional and social aspects, in order to suggest the creation of care strategies aimed at mental health.
