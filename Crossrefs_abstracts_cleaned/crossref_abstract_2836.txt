The discussion will highlight results of recent PhD research examining the use of nature/natural systems by rural leaders in furthering their individual community interests for conditions of health/wellness, resiliency and sustainability. The research was completed using a qualitative mixed methods case study approach within a diversity of municipality settings across southern Ontario. The research examines how community planning with a diversity of GI elements is being implemented, e.g. strategic plans, plans for landscape scaled storm water management, tree planting systems, wildlife area enhancements. A further examination is made on the utility of a holistic planning model combining community greygreen infrastructures in a foundational framework for rural places. Many of the problems facing rural communities such as socio-economic challenges and climate change impacts can be addressed using the untapped natural asset features that are found within all rural areas.
