This study aimed to analyze factors associated with resilience among persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). An integrative review was conducted. Electronic databases including PubMed, ProQuest, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science were searched using relevant search terms and keywords. A total of two qualitative and nine quantitative studies were included in the review. Psychosocial factors such as social support, self-efficacy, spirituality, post-traumatic growth, life satisfaction, adaptive coping strategies, psychological strength, and being a role model were associated with higher resilience. Stress, anxiety, depression, external locus of control, and attachment avoidance correlated with lower resilience. Inconsistent results were reported for demographic and injury-related variables such as the age of the participants, gender, pain, and functional independence. The integrative review reported a number of factors associated with resilience in people with SCI. Rehabilitation counselors working with this population can design rehabilitation interventions targeting these variables to enhance the resilience of people with SCI. Consideration of cultural and contextual influences on resilience, as well as the design of effective interventions, are important directions for future research.
