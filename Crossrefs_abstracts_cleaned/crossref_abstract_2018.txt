In January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus as a Public Health Emergency of international importance, the same happened in Kosovo. Public health actions, such as social distancing, isolation can make people feel lonely and can increase stress and anxiety.  This research aims to show the relationship between stress, anxiety, depression, and the development of resilience of social workers in the period of pandemics.  DASS will be used to measure S.A.D (Lovibond, SH & Lovibond, 1995) and the ARM to measure resilience (Ungar, 2008,2011).   It is hypothesized that S. Workers who have developed resilience will easily cope with S.A.D, while workers who failed to develop resilience will be more vulnerable to S.A.D. Participants are 39 social workers of CSW Pristina.  The findings of the study show that the level of SAD is toa moderate extent and the level of resilience is high.
