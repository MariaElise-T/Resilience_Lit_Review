SummaryDue to the general lack of familiarity with the concept in the medical field, resilience is rarely considered in pediatric medical traumas. Resilience is an ability that enables recovery after adversities such as traumas, surgeries, serious health problems, or social issues. Stress from medical traumas encompasses both the psychological and physical responses of children and their families. Lack of resilience in children with medical traumatic stress may contribute to poor adjustment, slow recovery, disruptive behaviors, and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, persistent parental distress increases the child's risk of low resilience. Consequently, these patients and their parents require early identification. This is achievable using a common stress measure such as the Perceived Stress Scale. Moreover, health care providers can screen patientsâ€™ risks for low resilience, which include few social contacts, poor family functioning, and low cohesion among family members. Findings from the stress scale and screened risks could indicate the need for additional psychosocial support at the time of diagnosis of a serious illness, soon after injuries, and before and after operations. Such interventions can include decreasing distress, counseling children and their parents, and enabling strong connections to health care providers. Health care providers can help parents to minimize distress and adjust to their child's illness, thereby supporting the child's resilience, adjustment, and recovery.
