Abstract
This study performs the comparative assessment of the initial embodied energy and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission between Thailand’s conventional reinforced concrete (RC) house and the Resilient Nest house which was designed and constructed for the Solar Decathlon Europe 2019 competition. The Resilient Nest is a prototype for the sustainable house and an alternative building in perspectives of renewable-energy, green building, energy efficient, and net-zero waste house. This house was designed and constructed by KMUTT team with an integration design of cosy house and the green economic system concept which have become a major concern nowadays for mitigating the environmental impacts due to an urban development. The environmental sustainability performance was investigated. All the materials used for convectional and the Resilient Nest houses as well as the energy used for the construction, were evaluated to illustrate the embodied energy (MJ) and GHG emission (kgCO2eq). As per square meter of the usable space of the house, the results show that the Resilient Nest house has embodied energy of 2,302.2 MJ/m2 and life-cycle greenhouse gas is about 122.22 kgCO2eq. Whereas, the conventional house is illustrated the consequences of embodied energy of 1,400 to 3,580 MJ/m2 and 300 – 4,625 kgCO2eq per square meter. The Resilient Nest house clearly proofs the minimizing environmental impact than the conventional house. The designation of materials was considered as an important parameter. In addition, as the whole life-cycle, the higher impact from the initial phase would be minimized and compensated during the service phase. To enhance the ultimate goal of the Resilient Nest house, recommendations for further improvement of the prototype house have been discussed.
