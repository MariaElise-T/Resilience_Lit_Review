 In this study, we examined the association between resilience, academic self-concept, and first-year student adjustment to college using data collected from 514 first-year undergraduate students enrolled at a medium-size, Hispanic-serving university in the southern United States. Utilizing a simultaneous multiple regression analysis, we found resilience and academic self-concept to be significant positive predictors of college adjustment for first-year students. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for college counselors and student affairs professionals working to support studentsâ€™ positive adjustment experiences.
