The literature on psychological and social responses to cleft palate and craniofacial conditions focuses on the challenges and limitations posed by biological factors, cognitive status, and social stigma. In spite of the various challenges experienced by persons with these conditions, many individuals have rich and satisfying lives. This paper develops a theoretical perspective to elucidate factors that account for health, life success, and resiliency in persons with craniofacial conditions. Three steps are proposed to change how craniofacial conditions are envisioned by clinicians and researchers: (1) creating optimism and positivity around the time of birth and diagnosis, (2) asking children and parents new and different questions, and (3) launching a new craniofacial social science model for research built around understanding resilience and health.
