AbstractAimsResilience represents a fundamental element in the experience of pain, as it allows adaptation to suffering and increases psychological social well‐being and quality of life (QoL). We investigated resilience in patients affected by urologic chronic pelvic pain (UCPP) and the relationships with pain severity and distribution, catastrophizing and psychological distress.MethodsForty‐eight consecutive UCPP patients were classified on a pain body map as being affected by pelvic pain only or widespread pain (WP), and underwent the evaluation of resilience with the 14‐item Resilience Scale (RS‐14), with higher scores indicating high resilience levels; scores < 56 denote very poor resilience. Pelvic and nonpelvic pain intensity and the bother of urinary symptoms on QoL were measured by means of Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS‐21) investigated catastrophizing and psychological conditions.ResultsOverall, RS‐14 mean ± SD total score was 50.2 ± 12.5 in patients with pelvic pain only and 40.2 ± 10.2 in those with WP. Significant relationships were observed between low resilience levels and high scores of pelvic and nonpelvic PNRS, VAS, pain catastrophizing scale and depression and anxiety, stress scale (for all: p < 0.001). Significantly lower RS‐14 scores were detected in females and in patients with WP.ConclusionsA very poor resilience has been identified in UCPP patients, particularly in those with greater catastrophizing and mood alterations. WP and female gender were mostly affected. In UCPP patients, low resilience appears as a crucial factor in pain experience.
