AbstractThis commentary compares the concept of resilience as conceptualized and studied in ambiguous loss and in the broader domain of developmental resilience science. The discussion highlights common roots, similarities and differences in the definitions of resilience and protective processes, and implications for interventions. Resilience concepts in ambiguous loss theory are congruent with contemporary developmental resilience theory in multiple ways. Future research and practice would benefit from further integration of these compatible perspectives on resilience.
