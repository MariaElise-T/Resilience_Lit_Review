Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to introduce and explore the concept of information resilience.Design/methodology/approach– The concept of information resilience emerges from a qualitative study that explored the health information experience and information practices of resettling refugees. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were employed and the data collected were analysed using an grounded theory approach.Findings– The present study describes information resilience as an outcome of information literacy practice. As an emerging concept information resilience has the potential to focus research attention towards the critical role that information and information practices such as information literacy have in supporting people whose knowledge bases, social networks and information landscapes have become disrupted during transition.Practical implications– Public libraries role in support the development of information resilience is considered.Social implications– The paper draws from a study of the health information experiences of refugees during resettlement (Lloyd, 2014). The concept of information resilience emerges as an outcome of information literacy practice, for people whose knowledge base has become disrupted; and, who because of this disruption, must engage with new information environments and construct new information landscapes to rebuild social capital and bridge the transition into a new community.Originality/value– Introduces the concept of information resilience as a focal point for investigating transition from an information studies perspective.
