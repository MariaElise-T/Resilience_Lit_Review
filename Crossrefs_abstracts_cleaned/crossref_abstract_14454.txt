AbstractThis article derives distributed generators resilience models considering lifeline dependencies during extreme events. The effects on power resilience of storage capacity, fuel delays, and fuel order placements are analyzed. Results indicate that storage capacity has an important role in improving overall power supply resilience as seen by loads. In addition, the presented models provide a quantifiable approach in evaluating fuel delivery resilience. The models facilitate studying fuel scheduling policies and local fuel storage sizing for specified resilience requirements. It is observed that tank autonomy greatly affects the flexibility in employing scheduling policies supplying fuel to generators. Resilience dependence on buffer autonomy is high during the first few days of extreme events, and this could have considerable effects on managing evacuations and rescue operations.
