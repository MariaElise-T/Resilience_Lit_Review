In order to solve the problem of urban short-term traffic congestion and temporal and spatial heterogeneity, it is important to scientifically delineate urban traffic congestion response areas to alleviate regional traffic congestion and improve road network efficiency. Previous urban traffic congestion zoning is mostly divided by urban administrative divisions, which is difficult to reflect the difference of congestion degree within administrative divisions or traffic congestion zoning. In this paper, we introduce the Self-Organizing Feature Mapping (SOFM) model, construct the urban traffic congestion zoning index system based on the resilience and vulnerability of urban traffic systems, and establish the urban traffic congestion zoning model, which is divided into four, five, six, and seven according to the different structures of competition layer topology. The four vulnerability damage capacity indicators of traffic volume, severe congestion mileage, delay time and average operating speed, and two resilience supply capacity indicators of traffic systems, namely, road condition and number of lanes, are used as model input vectors; the data of Guiyang city from January to June 2021 are used as data sets to input four SOFM models for training and testing and the best SOFM model with six competitive topologies is constructed. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to identify the optimal partition boundary line for traffic congestion. The results show that the four models predict the urban traffic congestion zoning level correctly over 95% on the test set, each traffic congestion zoning evaluation index in the urban area shows different obvious spatial clustering characteristics, the urban traffic congestion area is divided into six categories, and the city is divided into 16 zoning areas considering the urban traffic congestion control types (prevention zone, control zone, closure control zone). The spatial boundary is clear and credible, which helps to improve the spatial accuracy when predicting urban traffic congestion zoning and provides a new methodological approach for urban traffic congestion zoning and zoning boundary delineation.
