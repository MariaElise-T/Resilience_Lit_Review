 This study involves secondary analysis of an existing qualitative dataset (in-depth interviews with survivors [n = 6] and health professionals [n = 2], observations of a support group [n = 3], and field notes). Based on previous findings from this dataset, new questions arose regarding why only some of post–breast cancer lymphedema women who were interviewed appeared resilient within the context of their families. In the present study, we reinvestigate this dataset using the resiliency model of family stress, adjustment, and adaptation to guide our investigation via the construction of an a priori template used in analyses. Three stressors are identified that contribute to the vulnerability of these women. Resiliency in the women is characterized as adjustment, adaptation, or crisis. The present findings provide a foundation for assisting women with lymphedema and their families and underscore practitioners’ need to serve the patient and the family.
