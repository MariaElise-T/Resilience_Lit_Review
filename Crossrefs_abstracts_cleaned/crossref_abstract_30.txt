Economic resilience is operative in three levels of macro (governments), meso (market mechanisms) and micro (individual agents/ businesses) (Chaiechi, 2022). Economic resilience can be achieved through either or both inherent and adaptive strategies. Inherent resilience is an ordinary ability to manage a crisis, and it is routinely provided through resource allocation. Adaptive resilience is generally the system's ability to maintain functionality after being shocked that is achievable on the basis of extra effort. Due to large degrees of interdependencies between economic sectors, adaptive resilience in one sector can be significantly affected by changes in adaptive capacities in another. Therefore, efforts to build economic resilience cannot be implemented only by governments and at the macro level.
