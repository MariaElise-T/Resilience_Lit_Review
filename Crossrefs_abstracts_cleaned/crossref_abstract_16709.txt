 This study examined the indirect effects of individual, relational, and contextual resilience in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and prenatal depression. Participants included 101 pregnant women. Adverse childhood experiences had a direct effect on depression, B = 1.11, standard error = .44, p = .01, and relational resilience, B = −1.15, standard error = .19, p < .001, but not individual or contextual resilience. With resilience as a mediator, the effect of adverse childhood experiences on depression was no longer significant. Specifically, relational resilience had a significant indirect effect (IE) on the association between adverse childhood experiences and depression, IE = 1.04, boot standard error  = .28 (95% confidence interval  = .58, 1.68). Results emphasize the associated role of relational qualities, such as sense of security and belongingness, with childhood adversity and mental health.
