Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between relational interdependent self-construal and psychological resilience of university students who continued their education during the COVID-19 pandemic period.  Design and Methods: The study was designed with a quantitative design and a correlational survey model was used. The study data were collected by using an online questionnaire, a personal information form that contained demographic information, the Relational Interdependent Self-Construal Scale (RISCS), and the Adult Psychological Resilience Scale (APRS).  Participants: The sampling consisted of 363 university students who were selected with the convenience sampling method. Results: As a result, Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient was found to be positive (0.361) at a significance level of 0.01 between RISCS and APRS scores. In this respect, it can be argued that as the relational interdependent self-construal levels of students increases, their psychological resilience also increases.  Conclusion: The study results can guide practitioners in terms of intervention focuses by contributing to uncovering the importance of relationality and social support resources.
