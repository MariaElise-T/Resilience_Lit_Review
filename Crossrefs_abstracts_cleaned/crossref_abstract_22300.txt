Human resource excellence through resilience is a recent area of research in organisations to overcome all pitfalls of the workforce. Due to the pandemic wave of COVID-19, all institutions were closed for reducing the crisis dilemma; the entire world was affected especially the education sector. The lockdown system throughout the world arose out of the Corona epidemic and has created changes in the model of teaching, that is, from a conventional-lecture method to a virtual classroom system. Though the sudden shift affected the entire sector of education, the aftermath of this situation has adversely disturbed the college teachers and students. This study aimed at reducing the stress, worries and technological issues that college teachers are experiencing in Thrissur district, Kerala. By following a simple random sampling method, the study was conducted among 268 teachers who were working in a college by administering a self-structured questionnaire. The result through the SEM analysis has shown that resilience has prevented negative mental health, and stress in work while there was an increased workâ€“life balance, that is, the well-being of teachers. It has created a signature strength in their work.
