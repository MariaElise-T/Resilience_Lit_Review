This paper is an exploratory study that aims to identify, describe and compare the level of social capital on two types of cooperatives that have existed for a long time. The factors are determined by examining the structure of the organization and the member's social capital. Furthermore, 120 respondents were interviewed using the survey questionnaire to determine the members' socio-demographic characteristics and ascertain the members' level of social capital. A concurrent mixed method was used in the gathering and analysis of data. This study found that the member-respondents of the cooperatives have shown a high level of social capital in three dimensions: trust, norms and reciprocity; networks and collective actions; and Information and empowerment. However, the result on the T-test shows a significant difference between cooperatives in two dimensions, namely; 1) trust, norms and reciprocity and 2) networks and collective actions. An examination of the profile of the organizations and their members revealed that the member's ethnicity, religiosity, close family ties and neighbourliness may have contributed to a significant difference in these dimensions.Furthermore, the factors mentioned were found to impact how the cooperatives respond, cope and mitigate threats, crises and disasters. Furthermore, between cooperatives a better social capital is associated with better resiliency. This study recommends a more robust network affiliation with cooperatives in Bukidnon and other cooperatives in the locale. It also recommends that the cooperatives to conduct routine risk assessments and create innovative ways to sustain the members' social capital.
