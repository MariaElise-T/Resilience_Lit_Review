 Resilience, often reported as a factor for coping with adversity, is subject to available resources within or external to an individual. It is very important for sustaining wellbeing of a person during difficult times. In this study, the predictors of resilience among vulnerable school children are carefully examined. The study sample comprised 750 students in junior public high school in two local government areas of Osun State. Cross-sectional mixed method design was employed by using structured questionnaire and interview guide to collect data from the study population. Results showed that having an adult role model (OR=1.92, CI=1.00-3.60, P=0.044) and a good rapport with the guardian(s)/parent(s) (OR=2.29, CI=1.11-4.68, P=0.025) can significantly predict the resilience of vulnerable school children. In conclusion, the knowledge of predictors of resilience in children may help school nurses to strengthen parents' and guardians' interpersonal relationships with the children in their care.
