 This study aimed to evaluate the impact of resilience and social support on physical activity in adults with heart failure (HF) and to explore the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between social support and physical activity. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 197 adults with HF ( n = 197) from two outpatient departments for cardiovascular diseases. Resilience was assessed using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, social support using the Social Support Rating Scale, and physical activity using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Social support and resilience were significantly associated with physical activity in adults with HF. Resilience partially mediated the relationship between social support and physical activity, and the mediating effect accounted for 25.93% of the total effect of social support on physical activity. These findings contribute to the development of tailored interventions by targeting these two factors to increase physical activity levels in adults with HF.
