AbstractStormwater drainage in urban areas has become a challenge due to the rapid and random growth of urban areas, removal of vegetation, reduction in the effectiveness of drainage infrastructure, and climate change. Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), Low Impact Development (LID), Best Management Practices (BMP), Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) and the Sponge City Programme (SCP) are various aspects for urban stormwater management in a few parts of the world. Urban hydrology plays a vital role in the urban stormwater management system. However, optimal results can only be possible when the combined effect of climate change, land use patterns, reuse, treatment, ecology, and societal aspects are considered. There is a need to provide sustainable and resilient urban drainage systems to manage stormwater more efficiently. The present review has thoroughly discussed various features related to urban stormwater management, highlighted key drivers, identified knowledge gaps in each of the measures and/or practices, recommended future research needs of urban stormwater management to become sustainable and resilient. Integrated modelling approaches considering various key drivers including reuse and real time governance enables stormwater management to be sustainable and resilient in urban environments.
