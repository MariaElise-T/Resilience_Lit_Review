In this paper, we identify some conditions to compare the largest order statistics from resilience-scale models with reduced scale parameters in the sense of mean residual life order. As an example of the established result, the exponentiated generalized gamma distribution is examined. Also, for the special case of the scale model, power-generalized Weibull and half-normal distributions are investigated.
