AbstractBackgroundCOVID‐19 pandemic stress differentially affects older adults and persons from minoritized, underrepresented populations (URPs; e.g., Black, Latinx), yet potential protective factors are not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate whether pandemic‐related social and emotional stressors negatively affect functional capacity, mental health, and cognitive outcomes in an ethnoculturally diverse sample of middle‐aged and older adults.MethodCross‐sectional data were obtained from adults (55± years) participating in SALUD, an ongoing study examining risk and resilience factors for dementia in diverse populations. Participants completed a well‐validated, comprehensive battery of questionnaires and cognitive assessments. Aggregate scores of social and emotional pandemic stressors (e.g., more anxiety, loneliness) from Item 3 of the Pandemic Stress Index (PSI‐3) were examined in association with demographics, Patients Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI; self‐reported functional status measure), and Patient Health Questionnaire‐2 (PHQ‐2; self‐report depressive symptomatology measure). Demographically‐adjusted norms were used to compute Global Neurocognition (NC) and eight domain‐specific NC average T‐scores (e.g., learning, memory). Spearman’s correlations, Kruskal‐Wallis, Mann‐Whitney U‐tests were used for non‐normal variables.ResultThe sample included 110 adults (37.3% Non‐Latinx Black [NLB], 33.6% Latinx, and 29.1%, non‐Latinx White [NLW]; 63% female; M
age = 65.27 [SD = 7.11]; M
ed = 13.89 [SD = 3.07]). Age was negatively correlated with the PSI‐3 (rs = ‐.25, p<.01), but education (rs= ‐.05, p = .59) and gender (U<.01, p = .99) were not. PSI‐3 differed across ethnocultural groups (H = 8.00, p = .02), such that Latinx participants had the highest PSI‐3 scores. However, this relationship became non‐significant after accounting for age (p = .11). PAOFI impairment scores (rs = .37, p = .01) and PHQ‐2 scores (rs = .29, p = .01) were positively related to the PSI‐3, but Global NC and domain‐specific NC average T‐scores were not significant (rs = ‐.08 ‐ .10, ps> .05).ConclusionIn this ethnoculturally diverse sample, findings suggest older adults may be more resilient to pandemic‐related stress. Older age was associated with lower social and emotional pandemic stress, while greater functional impairment and depression were moderately associated with higher pandemic‐related stress. As pandemic‐related increases in psychosocial stressors (e.g., worry and depression) continue to affect middle‐aged and older adults, longitudinal research should investigate the risk and resilience factors that may buffer against developing these negative outcomes.
