Background: The effect of sequential exposure to different antibiotics is an underexplored topic. Azithromycin can be detected in humans for up to 28 days post-ingestion and may prime bacterial responses to subsequently ingested antibiotics. Methods: In this in vitro study, we assessed if preexposure to azithromycin could accelerate the acquisition of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Neisseria gonorrhoeae reference strain, WHO–F. In a morbidostat, we set two conditions in 3 vials each: mono-exposure (preexposure to Gonococcal Broth followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin) and dual sequential exposure (preexposure to azithromycin followed by exposure to ciprofloxacin).The growth of the cultures was measured by a software (MATLAB). The program decided if gonococcal broth or antibiotics were added to the vials in order to keep the evolution of the cultures. Samples were taken twice a week until the end of the experiment i.e. until resistance was achieved or cellular death. Additionally, six replicates of WHO–F WT and WHO–F with rplV mutation, caused by azithromycin, were exposed to increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin in plates to assess if there were differences in the rate of resistance emergence. Results: We found that after 12 hours of pre-exposure to azithromycin, N. gonorrhoeae's resilience to ciprofloxacin exposure increased. Pre-exposure to azithromycin did not, however, accelerate the speed to acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusions:  We found that azithromycin does not accelerate the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance, but there were differences in the molecular pathways to the acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance: the strains preexpossed to azithromycin followed a different route (GyrA: S91F pathway) than the ones without antibiotic preexposure (GyrA:D95N pathway). However, the number of isolates is too small to draw such strong conclusions.
