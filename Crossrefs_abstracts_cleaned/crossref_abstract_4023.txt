“You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them” (Angelou 1). What is resilience? “The word comes from Latin and refers to a physical property: a substance is “resilient” if it returns to its original form after being bent, stretched, or compressed” (Nevins). It is the ability to bounce back in the face of any adversity, calamity or danger. Humans are blessed with the unique power to thrive, to sustain and guard themselves. Resilience is the realization and utilization of this potential. The spirit to fight and to resist without succumbing to the pressures empowers a person to grow and shine. One needs grit and determination to defy odds, obstacles and to overcome traumatic experiences, which in turn paves the way for growth and success. The present paper intends to celebrate the power and spirit of Human Resilience in times of distress and agony as depicted in Angelou’s poem. It also gives a message to the readers that nothing can let a person down if he or she has the valor to fight with all his/her might.
