Abstract

Background
People of color (POC) are often underrepresented in clinical studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of aesthetic products, including hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, for which there is to date limited clinical data in POC.


Objectives
The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a new line of dynamic resilient HA fillers (RHA; Revance, Nashville, TN) for treating moderate-to-severe nasolabial folds (NLFs) in POC vs non-POC.


Methods
Post hoc subgroup analyses compared the efficacy and safety of POC vs non-POC subjects treated with RHA2, RHA3, or RHA4 for correction of moderate-to-severe NLFs in the pooled per-protocol population (N = 217) in 2 clinical trials. Evaluated population cohorts were classified by Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) (high FST [IV-VI] vs low FST [I-III]) and by subject-reported race (non-White vs White) relative to baseline at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months.


Results
POC consistently showed greater improvement in wrinkle severity and higher responder rates compared with non-POC, which reached statistical significance at several measured time points. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores and subject satisfaction ratings were similar for POC and non-POC and remained high throughout the course of the study. Treatment-related adverse event rates were generally lower for high FSTs vs low FSTs, with no reported cases of keloidal scarring.


Conclusion
The RHA line of dynamic fillers is well tolerated and effective for the correction of moderate-to-severe NLFs in POC and can be confidently used in this important and growing patient population.
