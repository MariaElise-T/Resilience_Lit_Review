University‐based leadership development programs have long included a focus on human intelligence and emotional intelligence to foster subject and relationship competence, respectively. In response to the need to develop leaders with a strong sense of individual purpose, vision, and values who can meet the challenges of a volatile business environment, spiritual intelligence, a measure of inner resilience, is being added to executive training curricula. All three elements were addressed in a four‐year leadership development program conducted through the University of Alberta for the Alberta Heath Services and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The results of post‐program self‐assessments and 360‐degree evaluations of the 160 program participants highlight the value of this three‐tier training method in molding a new generation of resilient leaders. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
