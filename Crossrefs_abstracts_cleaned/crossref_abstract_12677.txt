 Purpose: The capacity to recover motor function with pathology or age-related decline is termed physical resilience. It is unknown what outcome domains are captured with existing measurement instruments. Thus, this scoping review aimed to identify measurement instruments for physical resilience, identify research gaps, and make recommendations for future research. Methods: Articles were included from the search when their subject matter included the term resilience in relation to the physical health of older adults. Data on physical resilience measurement instruments were extracted using the outcome domains: body function or structure, activity and participation, and societal impact. Results: The majority of the 33 included articles involved older adults with fractures, cardiac conditions, and cancer. Many measurement instruments quantified body function or structure, and some instruments captured activity and participation, and societal impact of physical resilience. Measurement instruments were pooled into 4 categories: psychological, physiological, motor function, and psychosocial scales. No studies combined all areas of measurement. Conclusions: A potential gap of a measurement instrument capturing social aspects of physical resilience was identified. Comprehensive measurement could identify which outcome domains could be targeted to foster resilience. This knowledge might be useful across many health disciplines and contribute to therapeutic decision-making and rehabilitation strategies.
