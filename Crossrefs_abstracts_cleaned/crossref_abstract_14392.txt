Global industrial chain resilience refers to the capability of industrial chains, on a global scale, to maintain or restore their normal operations and value-creating ability in the face of various risks and uncertainties. This resilience is crucial for addressing crises, promoting economic growth, and upholding national security. However, there is currently a lack of unified standards and methods for measuring and enhancing global industrial chain resilience. This study constructs a global industrial chain production model in a multi-country and multi-stage open economy context. It utilizes data from the 1990–2021 Eora MRIO (Multi-Regional Input–Output) dataset to analyze the formation, measurement, and influencing factors of global industrial chain resilience. The research findings indicate that since 2010, the disparity in industrial chain resilience between different countries has gradually widened. Manufacturing plays a pivotal role in maintaining industrial chain stability. Additionally, factors such as input costs and technological levels have been found to positively impact the enhancement of global industrial chain resilience. Therefore, this study provides theoretical and empirical support for exploring and improving global industrial chain resilience, offering valuable guidance for policymakers and entrepreneurs.
