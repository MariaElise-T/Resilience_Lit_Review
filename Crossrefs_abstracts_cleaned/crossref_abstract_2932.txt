The current study is designed to identify factors that affect the psychological resilience of Palestinian adolescent ex-detainees of Israeli jails and understand the meaning and content of psychological resilience. This study utilizes qualitative data collection and analysis methods, mainly conducting semi-structured interviews and thematic analyses of interview content. The study sample consists of ten adolescent ex-detainees and uses purposeful selection to ensure the inclusion of ex-detainees from the southern areas of the West Bank (Bethlehem and Hebron), aged between seventeen to nineteen. The findings indicate that resilience is based on a high tolerance of stress resulting from traumatic events, such as arrest, and the ability to control life events, along with the reinforcement of a positive attitude toward social and political experiences, and the capacity to transform stress into an opportunity instead of a debilitating threat. The results also show that resilience is correlated with various factors, including secure attachment, supportive relationships, social support systems, conflict relationships â€“ personal and collective aggression, challenge, commitment to principles (i.e. nationalism) and post hoc engagement in public events (community and voluntary work, solidarity visits with families of ex-detainees, participation in public discourse).
