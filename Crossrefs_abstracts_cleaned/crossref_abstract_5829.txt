The aim of this research was to examine the psychological resilience and stress coping strategies of Karate athletes according to some demographic variables and to determine the relationship between them. A sample of 104 (54 females and 50 males, mean age 19.85±4.10 years) Karate athletes who trained in different sport clubs in Turkey were recruited. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) (Smith et al., 2008) and the Stress Coping Scale (SCS) (Sahin & Durak, 1995) were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, t-test and correlation analyses were used for data analysis. Participants’ psychological resilience was at mid-level, while the SCS self-confident approach and seeking social support sub-dimensions were at high and low level respectively. The athletes’ psychological resilience and stress coping strategies differed significantly according to gender. There was a positive and low significant correlation between experience and psychological resilience, in contrast a to negative and low significant correlation found between experience and helpless approach SCS sub-dimension. Middle and positive correlation was observed between age and psychological resilience. Finally, there were positive and middle significant correlations between psychological resilience and self-confident approach and optimistic approach, and a negative and middle significant correlation between psychological resilience and helpless approach SCS sub-dimensions.
