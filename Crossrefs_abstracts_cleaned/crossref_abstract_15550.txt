Abstract
A correlation pilot study was conducted to examine relationships between resilience protective factors and moral distress associated with clinical practica in nursing students. Aggregate moral distress rating was x = 3.67. Two of four resilience protective factor subcategories demonstrated significant inverse correlations with moral distress rating. Inverse correlations were found between social support and moral distress (r = −.27, p < .05) and between goal efficacy and moral distress (r = −.37, p < .01). The findings should help educators prioritize resilience-enhancing educational strategies.
