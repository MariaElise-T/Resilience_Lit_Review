Religious or spiritual well-being has a significant influence on family resilience, particularly in the spiritual aspect when dealing with changes or crises. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant change and crisis that can potentially impact religiosity and affect family resilience in spirituality. This study aimed to analyze the impact of religious well-being on family resilience in terms of family spirituality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a descriptive study, utilizing a cross-sectional survey approach. A total of 243 respondents were recruited for this research using accidental sampling technique. Data collection was conducted through questionnaires. Data analysis involved binary logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression, with a 95% degree of freedom and a standard error of 0.05. The main finding of this study indicates that religious well-being (p=0.000) significantly influences family resilience in family spirituality. Families with sufficient religious well-being are four times more likely to exhibit resilience in family spirituality compared to families with inadequate religious well-being (OR: 3.807; 95% CI: 2.230â€“6.498). The family resilience in family spirituality is strongly influenced by the factor of religious well-being. Strengthening the community with a religious approach is essential to bolster the family's ability to cope with the challenges posed by the pandemic.
