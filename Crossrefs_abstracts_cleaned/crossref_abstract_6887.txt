As disasters increase worldwide, there is greater need for effective and expedient disaster mental health response. The purpose of this paper is to present the etiology of transgenerational trauma to advance mental health counselors' understanding of the complex issues associated with trauma and disaster. The authors have woven literature from the field of trauma counseling with their own clinical experiences during deployment in post-Katrina New Orleans. The authors assert that mental health counselors can enhance clinical practice by using transgenerational trauma assessment and interventions as well as historical and contextual knowledge. A case example and recommendations are provided to demonstrate how to incorporate transgenerational trauma and resilience into clinical practice when working with disaster survivors.
