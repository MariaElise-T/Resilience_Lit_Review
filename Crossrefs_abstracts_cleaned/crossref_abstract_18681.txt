Abstract
The resilience of a region may affect how it reacts to economic crises and exogenous shocks. In a complex study, it is not sufficient merely to have knowledge of all the macro-indices of the regions, but it is also necessary to study internal micro-structures. This study introduces the regional homogeneity index, using a novel approach and as yet unused indicators by means of the example of two neighbouring NUTS 2 statistical regions. The results can be useful for understanding the regionsâ€™ economic development. The methodology and indicators created may also be suitable for European regional pilot research projects.1
