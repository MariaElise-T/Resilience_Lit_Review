Abstract
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), an average of 20 typhoons a year visits the Philippines; and one of the significant repercussions of typhoons is flooding. Due to worsening and intensifying typhoons, the flooding problem is also getting worse, and two of the main reasons for this are land subsidence and sea-level rise. Marilao, Bulacan, is one of the Philippines’ municipalities experiencing worsening flood levels. This study tackles an environmental approach to making the municipality adaptive and resilient to flooding by finding the most appropriate use of the land areas of Marilao – to benefit both the environment and its users. The study identified and analyzed the causes of flooding, using relevant maps such as hazard maps, existing land-use plans, and projected land-use plans to draft an effective plan for the municipality. After which, generating projections of the land conditions in the next century was done; to ensure that the proposed plans will accommodate future scenarios within the landscape. These data, along with four possible scenarios on the problems of the site, were analyzed. With this, the study took upon one of the approaches that led to the 2060 Environmental Protection Plan, which primarily focuses on addressing landscape requirements.
