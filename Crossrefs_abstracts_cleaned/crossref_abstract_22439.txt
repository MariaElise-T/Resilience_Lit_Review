AbstractBACKGROUNDTipburn is a physiological disorder of lettuce (Lactuca spp.). It causes discoloration and collapse of leaf margins, leading to unsaleable crops in both protected (glasshouse, hydroponic) and outdoor production systems. The occurrence of tipburn is hard to predict and is sensitive to environmental conditions. Phenotyping for tipburn resilience requires diverse germplasm resources and, to date, limited material has been investigated for this condition.RESULTSUsing a Lactuca diversity fixed foundation set (DFFS) under glasshouse conditions, we identified a significant (P < 0.001) genotypic effect on tipburn resilience across both the entire population and across lines belonging to the cultivated species L. sativa alone. Latuca sativa lines exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher average tipburn severity than those belonging to the wild species L. saligna, L. serriola, and L. virosa but we were able to identify both cultivated and wild tipburn‐resilient lines. Leaf morphology factors, which included pigmentation, width, and serration, also significantly (P < 0.05) influenced tipburn resilience. Using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from two DFFS lines, different small‐effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) accounting for 12.3% and 25.2% of total tipburn variation were identified in glasshouse and field conditions, respectively.CONCLUSIONSThese results reflect the advantages of phenotyping under production‐system‐specific conditions for the examination of environmentally sensitive traits and highlight genetic markers and germplasm resources for the development of tipburn resilient lines for use in both protected and outdoor lettuce production. © 2023 The Authors.
