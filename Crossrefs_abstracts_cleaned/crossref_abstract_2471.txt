 Background: Despite access for women administrators in educational leadership departments, the longevity of their service within them is tenuous. Women administrators are caught in the social constructions of gender and leadership.  Purpose: To explore how some women administrators in educational leadership programs have sustained their administrative roles; to evaluate whether their resiliency rests on a feminine type of leadership.  Participants: A group of seven diverse women administrators in educational leadership programs who were peer nominated, are accomplished scholars, and have an average of 11.25 years of experience.  Research Design: A computer-based qualitative Delphi technique using an online asynchronous mode and ensuring anonymity.  Data Collection and Analysis: Several iterations focused on the identification of resiliency markers and components, descriptions of episodes denoting the participants' overcoming difficult situations, proposals for adapting educational leadership programs to foster better women leaders, and the reflection and interpretation of data.  Findings: The participants' rankings and narratives indicate that gender identity and leadership are more complex than to simply fit them into one gender construction model or another. When interacting in particular episodes, resilient women leaders embrace or disclaim one gender norm for another to varying degrees. A multidimensional-gendered leadership model is provided.  Conclusions: Faculty and students should not expect the socially constructed norms in women leaders. These resilient participants suggest that gendered leadership norms are too simplistic and that women leaders must be willing to shift into multidimensional gender and traverse conventional borders.
