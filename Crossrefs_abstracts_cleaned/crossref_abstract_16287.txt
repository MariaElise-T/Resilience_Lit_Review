SummaryAs the backbone of Industrial 4.0, cyber‐physical systems (CPSs) are widely applicable in industrial processes. In this paper, a resilient control is designed for a class of two‐dimensional (2D) CPSs with the occurrence of Denial‐of‐Service (DoS) attacks. Firstly, we model the physical layer of CPSs as a 2D Fornasini‐Marchesini plant and set up the stability issue as preliminaries. Next, for CPSs suffering from DoS attacks, under which the controller operating in the fog layer is attacked by adversaries, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the exponential stability of the underlying systems, and the corresponding switched control is designed to make a prescribed system performance is satisfied. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design methods.
