Understanding the ecological mechanisms governing the resistance and resilience of microbial communities is a key issue to predict their responses to environmental disturbances. Using the zebrafish model, we wanted to clarify the potential mechanisms governing the resistance and resilience of gut microbiota after exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).
