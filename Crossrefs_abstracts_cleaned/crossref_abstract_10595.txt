This study examined the mediating effect of resilience and academic
   self-efficacy (psychological resources) in the relationship between social
   support and uncertainty of COVID-19. We recruited 607 Turkish undergraduate
   students (68% females) with a mean age of 21.71 years (SD = 3.18). Results
   showed that perceived social support positively predicted resilience and
   academic self-efficacy, while social support, resilience, and academic
   self-efficacy negatively predicted uncertainty of COVID-19. Findings
   highlight the significance of investing in social support resources for
   orchestrating gains in psychological resources, which may then support one
   another to act collectively to assuage the uncertainty of COVID-19.
   Theoretical contribution and practical implications of the results as well
   as study limitations and future research are discussed in the paper.
