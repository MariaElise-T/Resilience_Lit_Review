Subgrade resilience modulus is an important mechanical parameter in pavement design. It will directly influence the design result of pavement structure. Using BISAR3 of SHELL design method, the impacts of subgrade resilience modulus on pavement surface deflection, base and subbase bottom tensile stress, surface layer bottom tensile stress of the heavy load asphalt pavement structure were analyzed. And the influencing laws were analyzed, too. The results show that the mechanical and deforming characteristics of heavy load asphalt pavement were influnced significantly by subgrade resilience modulus. With the increasing of subgrade resilience modulus, the pavement surface deflection, base bottom tensile stress would significantly decrease, and fatigue life would be improved.
