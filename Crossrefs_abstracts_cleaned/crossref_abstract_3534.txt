Urban design and architecture have inadvertently contributed to the bifurcation of societies divided into haves and have-nots, thus undermining social equity, restricting opportunity, and resulting in poverty next to overabundance and waste. Global population growth and urban migration pressures compound the problem. The call for social equity and justice is, therefore, urgent from a social perspective and an environmental one. This study explores a concept we call ‘value-inclusive design’ and its potential for transformation toward ‘judicial equity’. Our value-inclusive design method proposes neighborhood interactions and co-design as a way to create welcoming spaces that preserve natural resources, support economic sustainability, and improve architectural design to foster health and wellbeing for people and the environment. This article discusses the potential of our value-inclusive design model in contributing to judicial equity by applying it to an international student competition called the ‘Global Greenhouse Challenge #3’, launched by Wageningen University and Research. By viewing the results of the Global Greenhouse challenge through the lens of value-inclusive design, we find that the model has merit and provides a useful theoretical framework for promoting social equity in urban planning and design. We conclude that by applying the model, its constructs can enhance design approaches that seek to improve the quality of life of residents while building resilience and shifting agency through co-design. The model can, thus, be a means for driving continuous improvement in architectural design and applying it in an educational setting such as the Global Greenhouse Challenge student competition.
