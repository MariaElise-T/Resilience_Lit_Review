A synthetic contaminated gas was generated, representative of gaseous emissions from sludge composting. It was composed of six volatile organic compounds (aldehyde, ketones, esters, sulphur compound) in an ammoniacal matrix. The gaseous stream was purified by biofiltration, in pilot scale biofilters filled with pine bark woodchips as organic carrier for biomass colonization. After reaching a constant high efficiency, with complete removal, the system was disturbed by transient loading shocks. The impact of perturbations was assessed by both performance evaluation (i.e. contaminant removal) and microbial behaviour. The microbial community was analysed in terms of density. The resilience of functional component following a perturbation was evaluated. This work highlighted the longitudinal distribution of both biodegradation activities and biomass density.
