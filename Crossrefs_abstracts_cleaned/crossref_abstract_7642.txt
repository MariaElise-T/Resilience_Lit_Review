In this study, we focus on resilience as the ability of specific infrastructure systems at the regional scale to absorb the shocks of extreme events, such as earthquakes. The occurrence of a disaster such as an earthquake leads to a rapid decrease in infrastructure performance. In the case of road networks, performance might refer to the number of drivers using the road within a certain period of time. The objective of this study is to propose a quantitative evaluation method to analyze road network performance (or performance loss) when natural disasters occur. Furthermore, we use cluster analysis and consider the performance loss and asset value in an attempt to propose a method to determine the critical path that should be prioritized for maintenance. This study aimed at analyzing hazard resilience from the network aspect through a scenario analysis depending on damage recovery after disaster occurrence. This study compared the hazard resilience speed to recover existing performance according to the scenario for damage recovery targeting the selected road network. It was found that the total increase in the utility (e.g., total travel time saved) gradually diminished as the restoration cost increased.
