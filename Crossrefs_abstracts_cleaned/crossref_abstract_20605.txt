The resilience of these communities plays a significant role in helping disaster victims recover from damage and adapt to their daily lives. Furthermore, the active social participation of disaster victims is essential for their social adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between community resilience and social adaptation among individuals affected by disaster damage, while also examining the moderating effect of social participation. Using data obtained from the survey results of the National Disaster and Safety Research Institute’s “Disaster Victim Safety Service Establishment” study, this research employed SPSS 22.0 statistical programs to analyze responses from 1,738 disaster victims. The analysis revealed that community resilience and social participation were positively related to social adaptation. Additionally, the level of social participation was found to moderate the relationship between community resilience and social adaptation. Based on the study’s findings, several suggestions were put forth.
