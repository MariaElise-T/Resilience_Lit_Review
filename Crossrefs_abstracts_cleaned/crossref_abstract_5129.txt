This study explored the patterns of adjustment to the quarantine restrictions imposed during the first Covid-19 wave in Greece. The sample comprised 1377 respondents from all geographical districts, mostly women (78.9%), with university degrees (80.7%) and an age range between 18-81. The Quarantine Adjustment Questionnaire was designed to assess the reactions of the general population to the lockdown restrictions and three diverse patterns. emerged from the analyses: positive adjustment (the Resilient), confinement stress (the Rebels) and introspection (the Internalizers), which served as the dependent variables in this study. Multiple linear regressions revealed that each profile consisted of characteristic childhood backgrounds, personal attributes, fears and concerns regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. Economic distress and negative childhood experiences differentiated the psychological effects of quarantine restrictions and determined to a large extent the adjustment pattern employed by each group. Women presented the most resilient profile but also the most vulnerable one, depending on the social and personal resources at their disposal. Young people were the most reactive group to the quarantine restrictions, but also the most unprotected to current and future adversity. Implications regarding the impact of sociocultural factors on patterns of adjustment and the need for new policies to support the vulnerable population are discussed.
