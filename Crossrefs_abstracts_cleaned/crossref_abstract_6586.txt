The well-being of employees has become an increasingly important topic for organizations, as it has been linked to a range of positive outcomes such as increased job satisfaction, productivity, and employee engagement. By examining the connections between resilience, stress, self-compassion, self-esteem, and financial wellbeing among corporate employees, this study hopes to add to the increasing body of research in this area. A total of 60 corporate employees in the age 25-45 were collected. Standardized scales were used to measure resilience, stress, self-compassion, self-esteem & financial well-being. The results found out a significant negative correlation of stress with resilience. Self-esteem had a significant positive correlation to resilience but negative significant correlation with stress whereas self-compassion was significantly negatively correlated with stress and significantly positively correlated with self-esteem. Financial well-being came out to be significantly positively correlated with resilience and self-esteem, both. Organizations should emphasize employee wellbeing by fostering work-life balance, establishing a good work environment, promoting a culture of health and wellness, and giving access to mental health resources, such as an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
