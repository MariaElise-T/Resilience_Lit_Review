In accordance with the scope of the study, a questionnaire consisting of 'Demographic Information Form', 'Beck Hopelessness Scale', 'Short Psychological Resilience Scale' and 'General Self-Efficacy Scale' were applied to the participants. Firstly, the assumptions of normality and homogeneity were tested for the analyzes to be carried out on the obtained data.
