Background/Objectives: Being dynamic in nature, Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) requires robust resource allocation strategy that can ensure both optimal transmission reliability and resource efficiency to meet Quality of Service (QoS) demands. The objective of this research is to address interference resilience requirement in MANETs which is must due to greedy nature of nodes especially when accessing resource or bandwidth and develop a highly robust stochastic prediction based resource allocation strategy. Methods: The proposed Interference Resilient Stochastic Prediction based Dynamic Resource Allocation model for Cognitive MANET (ISP-DRACM) intends to enable optimal resource allocation under interweave and underlay network setup with instantaneous as well as average interference conditions. It employs a joint power management and resource allocation strategy where it intends to maximize the weighted sum-rate of the secondary users under certain defined conditions like average power and stochastic interference level. Findings/Novelty: Inculcating resource allocation problem as controlled Markov Decision Process using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Lagrange relaxation, our proposed model achieves better resource allocation under limited noise or interference condition and hence achieves both costeffectiveness as well as QoS provision. This method has exhibited satisfactory performance towards spectrum allocation to the secondary users without imposing any significant interference for both interweave as well as underlay Cognitive Radio setup.
