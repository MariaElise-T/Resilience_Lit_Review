Researchers have defined resilient supply chain management in various ways and have analyzed and explained it using many managerial theories. Thus, identifying trends in existing studies could serve as a foundation for future supply chain resilience studies. However, despite the accumulation of a wide body of literature on resilient supply chains, few studies have analyzed the research trends systematically. Therefore, the present study aimed to synthesize and summarize research trends in the supply chain resilience domain using network analysis. The Scopus database and Google Scholar were used to search for research articles on supply chain resilience. We conducted an analysis by visually representing coauthorship, cocitation, PageRank, and keyword networks for 825 research articles and 1725 authors. This study identified the main topics, key articles, and major author groups of supply chain resilience research. The findings are expected to help expand the scope of research to a wide range of subfields in supply chain resilience research in the future.
