AbstractMultiple events over the last decade, including the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, demonstrate a global lack of preparedness for low probability but high consequence events. Following the evaluation of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, these authors called for a change from a risk‐oriented approach to a resilience‐focused framework for managing such disruptions. Over the past five years, the field of resilience analytics has conceptualized further resilience frameworks within the context of infrastructure development; however, the practice of resilience planning is still lagging behind the theories developed in the literature. In this article, we consider the lessons learned from the Fukushima nuclear accident through the lens of newly developed resilience analytics and the ongoing COVID‐19‐related challenges. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;18:1551–1554. © 2022 SETAC.
