Abstract
This study aimed to analyze the moderation and moderation effects of resilience on the anxiety, depression impact on post-traumatic growth (PTG) among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy based on structural equation modeling, and confirmed whether resilience was a mediating and regulating variable between anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic growth. In addition, whether anxiety and depression have different effects on PTG under different levels of psychological resilience.
This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to January 2019, with subjects of 260 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the department of breast and general surgery of a tertiary general hospital in Shanxi Province of China.
Data were collected according to the General Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the posttraumatic growth inventory. Estimated values of model path coefficients and significance test were performed to confirm the mediation effect. Hierarchical regression and simple slope test were used to analyze the regulation effect.
Resilience showed significant correlations with anxiety, depression and PTG (all P < .01). Estimated values of model path coefficients and significance test results indicated that the mediating role of resilience was remarkable and it could regulate anxiety, depression, and PTG.
The anxiety, depression and resilience affected their PTG of breast cancer patients during chemotherapy, suggesting the need to establish a cooperative mechanism based on the concept of multidisciplinary collaboration. Professional psychological intervention should be used to reduce anxiety and depression and to explore the potential of resilience to promote their PTG.
