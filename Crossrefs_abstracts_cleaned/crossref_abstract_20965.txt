AbstractResilience is a dynamic, multidimensional complex concept that implies risk and protective factors, adaptation, and success. Communication and language are often identified as barriers in deaf children's development. However, research linking deafness in childhood and resilience is scarce. The present comprehensive literature review aims to verify which are the predominant risk factors for this group, which protective factors may be identified and if significant differences have been found between deaf and hearing children regarding resilience. A systematic search, performed in seven databases, identified 11 articles published in peer‚Äêreviewed journals between 2000 and 2019 that met the criteria. Deaf children experience exposure to risk through obstacles in communication, language, and information failure. Consequently, differences between hearing and deaf children are related to more difficulties in emotion regulation and interpersonal relationships. Principal protective factors are a supportive family, school staff, and peers. Practical implications and recommendations for future research are provided.
