Coastal wetlands (CWs) offer numerous imperative functions that support a diverse array of life forms that are poorly adapted for other environments and provide an economic base for human communities. Unfortunately, CWs have been experiencing significant threats due to meteorological and climatic fluctuations as well as anthropogenic impacts. The wetlands and marshes in Apalachicola Bay, Florida have endured the impacts of several extreme hydrologic events (EHEs) over the past few decades. These extreme hydrologic events include drought, hurricane, heavy precipitation and fluvial flooding. Remote sensing has been used and continues to demonstrate promise for acquiring spatial and temporal information about CWs thereby making it easier to track and quantify long term changes driven by EHEs. These wetland ecosystems are also adversely impacted by increased human activities such as wetland conversion to agricultural, aquaculture, industrial or residential use; construction of dikes along the shoreline; and sprawl of built areas. In this paper, we review previous works on coastal wetland resilience to EHEs. We synthesize these concepts in the context of remote sensing as the primary assessment tool with focus on derived vegetation indices to monitor CWs at regional and global scales.
