Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted people's lives. Families are affected in many ways, including daily life, the economy, social life, and health. Families who have resilience can face the COVID-19 pandemic situation. This study aims to determine the factors related to family resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, including Family income, education, family type, family relations, and social support.
Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted on 403 respondents using purposive sampling. Inclusion criteria include Husband or wife (with or without children) who live together, ages 18-65 years, in Jakarta and Tangerang. Data collection using an online questionnaire consisted of demographic data, the Family Resilience Assessment Scale (FRAS), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The questionnaire has passed the validity and reliability test. The Ethics Board of the Mochtar Riady Institute of Nanotechnology (MRIN) provided ethical approval.
Results: Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression test showed that factors related to family resilience were income (p-value: 0.028, OR: 3.08) and social support (p-value: 0.001, OR: 7.16). Social support is the dominant variable related to family resilience. An increase in social support increases the likelihood of family resilience by 7.16 times. Furthermore, an increase in family income has a 3.08 times greater chance of increasing family resilience.
Conclusion: Families and the government can collaborate to improve family resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic by optimizing social support and family income.
