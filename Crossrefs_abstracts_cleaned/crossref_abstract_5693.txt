 I have now lived through eras when anthropological archaeology was (a) mainly culture history; (b) part of four-field anthropology; (c) hypothetico-deductive science; (d) under attack from postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism; and (e) saved from extinction by its own resilience. In this never-before-published interview, I reveal its likely future direction. (Drum roll, please.)
