Background and ObjectivesAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent in US military veterans, though little is known about whether the psychiatric comorbidities and functional outcomes (ie, clinical features) of AUD differ across race/ethnic groups. We aimed to identify differences in the clinical features of veterans with AUD by race/ethnicity.MethodsIn a sample of veterans with AUD (n = 1212) from the nationally representative National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, we compared the clinical features associated with AUD across racial/ethnic groups using analysis of covariance and logistic regression.ResultsBlack veterans (n = 60, 34.0%) were less likely to screen positive for lifetime AUD compared with white (n = 1099, 42.7%) and Hispanic (n = 53, 41.5%) veterans. Among those with lifetime AUD, Hispanic veterans were more likely than white veterans to have lifetime and current mood or anxiety disorders (adjusted odds ratio range [AORR] = 2.21‐2.52, P < .05). Black veterans were more likely than white veterans to have current mood and anxiety disorders (AORR = 2.01‐3.07, P < .05). Hispanic veterans reported poorer functioning and quality of life than white and black veterans (Cohen's d range = 0.12‐0.37, P < .05).Discussion and ConclusionsBlack and Hispanic veterans with lifetime AUD may experience a higher disease burden relative to white veterans. Results underscore the importance of race/ethnicity‐sensitive assessment, monitoring, and treatment of AUD for veterans.Scientific SignificanceThis is the first known study to examine differences by race/ethnicity in the clinical features of Veterans with AUD in a nationally representative sample. Findings suggest higher disease burden for racial/ethnic minority veterans. (Am J Addict 2021;30:26–33)
