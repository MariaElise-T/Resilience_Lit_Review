AbstractMungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek var. radiata) is a significant food and cash crop grown in tropical and subtropical regions. Mungbean production and consumer demand have increased substantially over the last two decades, owing to its agronomic, nutritional and economic benefits. Despite increased breeding efforts and the expansion of mungbean production in various agro‐climatic regions, further production is hindered by low yield and variability, which is partly attributed to the impacts of abiotic stress. Abiotic stress impacts on the physiology, morphology and reproductive ability of mungbean which influences yield. Exposure to abiotic stresses at the reproductive stage is considered the most critical for yield production. In this review, we evaluate how abiotic stress impacts mungbean growth and productivity when occurring during the reproductive stage and traits that may confer adaptation. We present the limitations of current research including limited number of genotypes, lack of field experiments and detailed experimental information. We highlight the opportunities to exploit new tools and technologies, such as high‐throughput phenotyping platforms, gene editing, and genomic selection, to accelerate breeding efforts to develop more resilient mungbean cultivars for today and tomorrow.
