This paper presents an analytical method adopted for the free vibration analysis of a shaft, both ends of which are supported by resilient bearings. The shaft is modeled by Timoshenko beam theory. Based on this model exact frequency equation to calculate complex eigenvalues is derived and presented in complex compact form for the first time. Explicit expressions to compute the corresponding mode shapes are also presented.
