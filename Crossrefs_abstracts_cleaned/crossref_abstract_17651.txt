AbstractMental health nursing work is challenging, and workplace stress can have negative impacts on nurses' well‐being and practice. Resilience is a dynamic process of positive adaptation and recovery from adversity. The aims of this integrative review were to examine and update understandings and perspectives on resilience in mental health nursing research, and to explore and synthesize the state of empirical knowledge on mental health nurse resilience. This is an update of evidence from a previous review published in 2019. Using integrative review methodology, 15 articles were identified from a systematic search (July 2018–June 2022). Data were extracted, analysed with constant comparison method, synthesized narratively and then compared with the findings from the original review. As an update of evidence, mental health nurse resilience was moderate to high across studies, was positively associated with psychological well‐being, post‐traumatic growth, compassion satisfaction and negatively associated with burnout, mental distress and emotional labour. Lack of support and resources from organizations could negatively impact nurses' ability to maintain resilience and manage workplace challenges through internal self‐regulatory processes. A resilience programme improved mental health nurses' awareness of personal resilience levels, self‐confidence, capacity to develop coping skills and professional relationships. Some studies continue to lack contemporary conceptualizations of resilience, and methodological quality varied from high to low. Further qualitative and interventional research is needed to investigate the role of resilience in mental health nursing practice, personal well‐being, workforce sustainability and the ongoing impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic.
