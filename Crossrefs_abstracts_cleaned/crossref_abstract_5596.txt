Individuals with psychiatric disabilities and those with developmental disabilities experience higher rates of trauma than nondisabled individuals. An optimal response to trauma is resilience. Having a firm grasp on the concept of resilience and being informed about factors that contribute to resilience will equip rehabilitation counselors to promote well being in their clients. This paper provides an in-depth conceptualization of the theoretical notion of resilience. A rationale for why it is important to understand resilience as a response to trauma is presented. The factors associated with resilience are carefully examined. The implications of these findings for rehabilitation counselors are outlined, including how services to clients may be adapted in order to cultivate resilience.
