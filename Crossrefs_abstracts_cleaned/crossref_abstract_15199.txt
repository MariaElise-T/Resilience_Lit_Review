BACKGROUND: The worldwide increase in drug-resistant pulmonary TB (DR-PTB) has a significant impact on patient´s physical and mental health. The objective of this study is to assess the stress resilience of DR-PTB patients along with the factors associated with it.METHODS:
 A total of 385 adult DR-PTB patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pre-extensive drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB admitted to the National Institute of Diseases of the Chest Hospital (Dhaka, Bangladesh) between January 2020 and March 2021 were conveniently recruited. Resilience data were collected
 using a validated Stress Resilience Scale (RS 25) questionnaire.RESULTS: The mean resilience scores were significantly higher for patients with MDR-PTB than those with pre-XDR-PTB (P = 0.02). A majority of the MDR-PTB (77.0%) and pre-XDR-PTB (65.1%) patients belonged to the
 ≤45 years age group. Multiple linear regression revealed that sex (P < 0.001), level of education (P < 0.001), employment status (P = 0.003) and presence of asthma (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with stress resilience.CONCLUSION: We
 observed that stress resilience significantly differed between patients with MDR-PTB and those with pre-XDR-PTB based on sociodemographic characteristics.
