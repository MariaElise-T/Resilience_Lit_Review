This article will aim to give an overview of stress and resilience, briefly exploring current definitions. It will try to identify why psychological resilience is relevant in the military context and suggest why the UK military could be exploring data from other countries and welfare bodies to enhance their own stress management policies in order to improve military mental health. The MOD (Ministry of Defence) understands their duty of care and has developed a clear strategic intent to tackle the increasing numbers of personnel developing mental health issues. While all three Services currently have in place comprehensive predeployment and postdeployment strategies to signpost individuals, there is a lack of psychological fitness training. Examining resilience in the civilian sector has identified the relevance for individuals to be psychologically resilient in any context. The skills and techniques of the Special Forces are now becoming popular in the business world to increase resilience in individuals and their organisations. The MOD could improve military mental health through relevant strategies aimed at building resilience.
