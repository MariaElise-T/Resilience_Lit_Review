Modern variability, unpredictability, hybridity, combination of challenges and threats, complexity, ambiguity of their impacts and turbulence of their consequences, have made issues of prevention, control, increased readiness to meet them and continue productive life in case of their occurrence extremely important for countries in the world and their population. In recent decades, the issue of ensuring resilience to the challenges of national security in democracy, in Ukraine in particular, such as terrorism and political violence, which are increasingly in need of scientific study and rethinking, has also become critical. The expediency of introducing the term "resilience" is still controversial in Ukraine today because domestic scholars consider using the concepts of "national stability", "national security". We are convinced that the use of resilience is an extremely important issue for consideration by Ukrainian scholars and practitioners today.
The purpose of this article is to highlight the issues of formation and development of national resilience in modern scientific thought in Ukraine and the search for a relevant definition of this concept.
