This paper investigates the stabilization problem for stochastic net-worked control systems under periodic denial-of-service (DoS) jammingattacks. First, the resilient hybrid-triggered communication scheme isdeveloped to reduce the network transmission data and improve theutilization eﬃciency, where a Bernoulli distribution is used to charac-terize the switching protocol between time-triggered scheme and event-triggered scheme. Then, a resilient hybrid-driven control protocol isdesigned, and a new switched stochastic system is constructed. Suﬃ-cient conditions of the mean-square exponential stability are derivedfor the underlying system under DoS attacks. Furthermore, a co-designscheme of the feedback gain and the hybrid-triggering parameter is ob-tained by solving linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a satellite controlsystem is employed to illustrate the virtue and applicability of the pro-posed approach.
