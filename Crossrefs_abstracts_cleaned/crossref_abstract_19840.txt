AbstractChildhood and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors experience poor health outcomes in adulthood. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) also portend poor health outcomes for the general population. Resilience can mitigate effects of ACEs. We examined the feasibility of assessing ACEs and resilience in childhood and AYA cancer patients. We also described occurrences of ACEs, resilience, and poor health outcomes. Of 52 participants, most rated their study experience favorably, with privacy in answering sensitive questions. Half reported ACEs, and those with ACEs had lower resilience; X2(3, N = 52) = 9.4, p = .02. Further investigations of ACEs and resilience in larger cohorts are warranted to delineate associations with long‐term health outcomes.
