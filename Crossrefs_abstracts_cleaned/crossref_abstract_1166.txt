Date Presented 04/22/2023
This study examined the factors that affect resiliency and quality of life of pediatric caregivers. Results indicated similar levels of resiliency in caregivers living in both rural and urban areas. They further indicated the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have had on resiliency. This study aimed to focus on the well-being of the caregiver in an attempt to determine the need for enhanced resources for those living in both rural and urban environments.
