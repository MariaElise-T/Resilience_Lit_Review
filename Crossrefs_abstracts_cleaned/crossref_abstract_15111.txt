This study examined the resilience experiences of 13 sexual and gender minority persons living with disabilities, using phenomenological qualitative methodology. Researchers used in-depth, semi-structured interviews and various trustworthiness standards in the study. Participants endorsed four common resilience maximizers—self-acceptance, advocacy, social support, and a plea for recognition of humanity (an aspirational resilience maximizer)—and three common resilience minimizers—fragmentation, identity concealment, and punishment. Counseling implications and future research directions are also discussed.
