Open urban spaces play a key role in achieving city resilience, the urban ability to survive in extreme conditions caused by phenomena such as heat waves and urban heat islands and to absorb change and disruption. Urban regeneration planning and intervention design are critical for providing thermal and wind comfort to citizens and enhancing urban resilience. Supporting decision makers, the microclimate created in urban planning use cases is simulated to identify, assess, and rate the bioclimatic impacts of alternative plans. The Bioclimatic Index is proposed based on the simulation results and the rated plans to strengthen evaluation of urban regeneration plans and interventions that empower urban microclimate and resilience. The methodology is applied to an abandoned space in the Old Port of Patras, Greece, of wet Mediterranean climate, and can be extended to urban areas with similar characteristics.
