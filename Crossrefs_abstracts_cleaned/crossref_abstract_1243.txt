Temporary urbanism practices are forms of appropriation of the public space by the citizens. They can be a powerful engine for urban regeneration and social innovation, empowering local communities to take ownership of urban spaces, promoting positive urban change. In particular, the collective creation of temporary art installations in public spaces can foster a sense of belonging and define new forms of civic participation, including unrepresented voices, and re-activate the public realm. The portfolio narrates the development of the “Co-Creation of Temporary Interventions in Public Space as a Tool for Community Resilience” (University of Portsmouth) project, which promotes and develops a series of tactical, small-sized, co-created, temporary interventions in public spaces, bringing together various local actors and underrepresented groups. Temporary urbanism initiatives can be very powerful tools; while the change they bring may be small at first and incremental, the varied ways in which such initiatives affect the city and its citizens lead to an extremely meaningful and long-term impact.
