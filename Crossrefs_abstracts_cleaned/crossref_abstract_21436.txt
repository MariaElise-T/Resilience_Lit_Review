AbstractMental health nurses are exposed frequently to occupational stress and can experience a range of negative impacts on their well‐being and intention to stay in the nursing workforce. Promoting Resilience in Nurses (PRiN) is a strength‐based resilience education programme that incorporates evidence‐based cognitive behavioural and interpersonal approaches with post‐traumatic growth theory. A partially clustered randomized controlled trial at a large public mental health service will be used to examine the effects of PRiN on mental health nurses’ coping self‐efficacy, resilience, well‐being, mental health, emotional regulation, post‐traumatic growth, workplace belonging, and turnover intention as compared to controls. Process evaluations are increasingly used to help understand and interpret trial results for complex interventions. This paper describes the protocol for an embedded mixed methods process evaluation that aims to evaluate the PRiN programme implementation and identify factors that may explain variation in participant outcomes in the trial. Data collection includes a programme participant satisfaction survey; a follow‐up semi‐structured interview with selected programme participants; a unit/team manager survey on barriers and facilitators to staff recruitment and programme participation; and a fidelity checklist completed by programme facilitators. Normalisation Process Theory will be used to inform data analysis and integration. The findings will provide insights into factors that affect programme implementation, particularly in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic and may help explain differences in participant outcomes. Findings will also inform post‐trial programme sustainability as well as potential future upscale and adaptation for implementation across healthcare settings.
