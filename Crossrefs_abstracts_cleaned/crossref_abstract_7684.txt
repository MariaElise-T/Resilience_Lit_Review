 Environmental conditions such as temperature and moisture can significantly influence the performance of a pavement structure. These conditions vary within the pavement layers, degrading or enhancing the properties of pavement materials. The AASHTO 1993 design guide accounts for this influence by incorporating a single resilient modulus ( MR) value that represents the effective roadbed resilient modulus; the revised AASHTO Mechanistic–Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) uses models that predict changes in modulus due to moisture, temperature, or both. The effect of changes in postcompaction moisture content (i.e., wetting or drying) on the resilient moduli of subgrade soils is evaluated. The effects of wetting and drying were examined by conducting resilient modulus tests on specimens compacted at various initial moisture contents: optimum moisture content (OMC), 4% drier than OMC (OMC – 4%), and 4% wetter than OMC (OMC + 4%). Results showed that MR–moisture content ( MRMC) relationships caused by drying exhibited higher values than the corresponding MRMC curves for specimens subject to wetting. The most significant finding was that changes in MR values depended on the initial compaction moisture contents; the MR values compacted at OMC exhibited a different drying and wetting trend than the ones compacted at OMC ± 4%. Finally, the MEPDG MR–moisture model was modified in this study to better predict the variations of resilient modulus with moisture changes.
