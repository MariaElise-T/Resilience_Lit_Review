Abstract
Resilience is a capability that measures whether a system can change its state to reduce the loss of fault in case of serious disturbance or fault, and return to the original normal state as soon as possible after fault removal. Based on the resilience analysis model, this paper proposes measures to improve the resilience of transmission lines through qualitative or quantitative analysis, and provides technical support for improving the reliability of important transmission channels. This study illustrates the connotation of the concept of resilience, and the area model and expression of the impact of external impact on the system are established. This study takes the transmission line as an example and applies the area model to calculate, and puts forward the strategy to improve the resilience and the resource allocation scheme under the condition of limited resources.
