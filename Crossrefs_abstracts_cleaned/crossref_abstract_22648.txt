Achieving improvement in the resilience of road transport networks by ensuring their smooth functioning and prompt recovery in the event of damage is crucial. This study focused on optimal measures and compared the effect of improvement measures on the resilience of road transport networks. A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether and to what degree the resilience of road transport networks was improved with different categories of measures. The articles were divided based on improvement measures, such as infrastructure investment, structure and planning, traffic signal management, and recovery schedule. The methodology of how to define and measure the resilience of road transport networks is considerably diverse, and most definitions are based on basic infrastructure structures. The efficiency of four types of improvement methods was grouped: structure and planning, infrastructure investment, recovery schedule, and traffic signal management. This study supports the use of structure and planning as a promising way for improving the resilience of road transport networks. Increasing comparability in studies and finally developing effective improvement measures in transport planning and decision making require more precise conceptual and methodological standardization in road transport network resilience.
