The H∞ filtering problem for a class of networked nonlinear Markovian jump systems subject to randomly occurring distributed delays, nonlinearities, quantization effects, missing measurements and sensor saturation is investigated in this paper. The measurement missing phenomenon is characterized via a random variable obeying the Bernoulli stochastic distribution. Moreover, due to bandwidth limitations, the measurement output is quantized using a logarithmic quantizer and then transmitted to the filter. Further, the output measurements are affected by sensor saturation since the communication links between the system and the filter are unreliable and is described by sector nonlinearities. The objective of this work is to design a quantized resilient filter that guarantees not only the stochastic stability of the augmented filtering error system but also a prespecified level of H∞ performance. Sufficient conditions for the existence of desired filter are established with the aid of proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality approach together with stochastic analysis theory. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the developed theoretical results.
