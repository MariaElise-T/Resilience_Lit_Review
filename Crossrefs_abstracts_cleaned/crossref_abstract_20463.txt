This study aims to identify the structural relationships between parenting stress, resilience, and mindfulness in parents with adolescent children, and to verify the mediating effect of mindfulness in the relationship between parenting stress and resilience. To this end, a survey was conducted among parents of adolescent children nationwide. A total of 412 people participated, and a total of 400 data points were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0, excluding data that responded insincerely to the questionnaire. First, parenting stress directly affects resilience. Second, mindfulness was analyzed as mediating in the relationship between parenting stress and resilience. These results suggest the importance of parenting stress and mindfulness for resilience and the possibility of intervention through counseling. Based on the results of the study, it is possible to understand the structural relationship of variables that affect the resilience of parents with adolescent children, and the educational use of mindfulness that can be accessed in the field of parent counseling and education, its relevance with previous studies, and the implications and limitations of the study.
