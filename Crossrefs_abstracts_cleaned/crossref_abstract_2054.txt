It is the purpose of this presentation to provide a current update of the major resilient channels available with and without acoustical isolators in floor-ceiling assemblies with and without various finished floor systems. All the testing was conducted with in twelve months of the date of this paper. All the samples where either purchased at retail outlets or donated by the manufacturers for these tests. Here in we compare the most popular brand names and models of resilient channels with and without resilient channel isolators. The finished flooring and finished flooring mats where standardized to reduce the number of finished flooring tests required to demonstrate the advantages of the resilient channels and the resilient isolator. All though this presentation may not include 100% every available product. We have selected the most commonly used products: resilient channels, rubber mat and finished flooring. In open web timber truss, TJI and solid timber joist. This research should be important to every acoustical engineer whom is concerned about delivering current state of the art, cost effective, noise control solutions to the client.
