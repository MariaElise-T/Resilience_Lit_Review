Applications in real life are composed of different kinds of network systems; these networks may be interfered by uncontrollable or unpredictable disruptive events involving natural disasters, human errors, evil-intentioned attacks, or other disturbances. Any of these disruptive events will cause networks to malfunction and possibly result in large economic losses. As a result, it is important to assess network resilience which is a measure to describe how a network system recovers its performance and functionality to a satisfactory level from a disruptive event. Inspired by the measures of reliability evaluation used in binary-state networks, this paper proposes a binary-addition tree algorithm-based resilience assessment for binary-state networks and applies it on a wildfire network with wireless sensors. Considering the stochastic nature of disruptive events, the proposed binary-addition tree algorithm-based resilience assessment comprehensively enumerates all the possible disruptive events and all the corresponding recovery strategies, and then calculate the network resilience. Furthermore, recovery cost limit is concerned in this paper for decision makers who choose the recovery strategies with their recovery cost limit and resilience requirement.
