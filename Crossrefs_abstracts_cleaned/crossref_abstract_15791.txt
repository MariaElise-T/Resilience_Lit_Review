Purpose
This paper aims to study the influence of project managers’ signature strengths on project team resilience.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors performed a qualitative multiple case study design to explore the research question. Open-ended interviews, site visits, observations and documents were the data sources. The authors used character strengths and virtues within positive psychology as a theoretical framework in the data analysis.


Findings
The main finding of this study is that the project manager’s use of signature strengths influences the resilience of the project team. The cross-case analysis revealed four signature strengths – leadership, open-mindedness, persistence and hope – that influenced team resilience in all three studied cases.


Research limitations/implications
Future research should investigate other organizations, types of projects and countries so that the findings may be generalized.


Practical implications
This paper provides managers and teams with useful insights on signature strengths and team resilience. The findings stress the importance of managers being aware of their signature strengths and knowing how to use them. As the working situation today is often more complex, uncertain and difficult than ever, it is important to have resilient managers and teams.


Originality/value
This study contributes to increased knowledge on signature strengths and team resilience.
