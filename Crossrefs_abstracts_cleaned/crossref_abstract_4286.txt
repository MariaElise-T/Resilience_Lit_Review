Psychological resilience is a new concept emerging with the development of psychology. It is defined by Conner as an individual's ability to resist pressure and is an important indicator for the treatment of anxiety, depression and stress response. According to the current model of resilience, parenting style is an important influencing factor. However, most studies have focused on teenagers and young children and less on college students. College students are at a stage of maturing self-awareness where qualities such as psychological resilience are further developed. Therefore, this study regarded college students as the research object, using literature analysis to explore the relationship between parental rearing style and college students' psychological resilience. This can not only expand the research scope of parental rearing style and psychological resilience in theory but also have certain practical significance for personality education and willpower cultivation of college students, and to a certain extent, provide reference and reference for psychological counselling work in colleges and universities and psychological counselling units.
