Background: Resilience is a dynamic capability which helps people to survive on challenges given appropriate social and personal contexts. Objective: To determine the resilience and to find out the association between resilience and selected socio-demographic variables, if any. Methodology: An institution based mixed method study was conducted among MBBS students from April to May, 2018 at IQ City Medical College by using Child and Youth Resilience Measures Questionnaire (CYRM-28). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed using SPSS-21software.Results: Older students, Males, 8th semester batch, and day boarder were more resilient in certain areas. In individual and contextual domain, score gradually increased with increase in age groups. Resilience score were more or less similar among both the sexes. 8th semester students were found to be more resilient in all the domains. Personal skills, social skills, psychological care giving, education, played much larger role in differences across the sex, age, semester, and accommodation. Conclusion:Thus counselling and more teacher student bonding are required to propagate the resilience of the medical students. More emphasis has to be given on identified areas so as to make our future doctors more strong and resilient.
