The Covid-19 pandemic has been fading gradually, but another problematic phase has begun for organizations in the post-Covid-19 era in Vietnam. This study aims to examine the direct impact of transformational leadership on adaptive resilience, the indirect impact of transformational leadership on adaptive resilience via psychological and employee resilience, and the interactions between the levels of resilience. Quantitative research was used to analyze data from 324 employees chosen via convenient sampling in Vietnam. The findings indicated that transformational leadership directly impact adaptive resilience (β = 0.559, p &amp;lt; 0.000), psychological resilience (β = 0.361, p &amp;lt; 0.000), and employee resilience (β = 0.292, p &amp;lt; 0.000) and also indirectly impact adaptive resilience via psychological and employee resilience (β = 0.135, p &amp;lt; 0.000), and employee resilience via psychological resilience (β = 0.130, p &amp;lt; 0.000). Furthermore, there was also the direct influence of psychological resilience on adaptive resilience (β = 0.135, p &amp;lt; 0.005) and the indirect influence of psychological resilience on adaptive resilience via employee resilience (β = 0.073, p &amp;lt; 0.000). The other direct significant relations, such as between psychological resilience and employee resilience, and between employee resilience and adaptive resilience, were also confirmed (β = 0.360, p &amp;lt; 0.000; β = 0.204, p &amp;lt; 0.000).
