Flood Disaster Averted: Red River Resilience It is estimated that floods make up 40% of all natural disasters and that the majority of natural disaster deaths are attributable to these events. The vast majority of literature on mental health and disaster revolves around response and recovery after the event. Mitigation of flooding can have a tremendous impact on health, including the prevention of common physical ailments including diarrhea, hepatitis, typhoid, tetanus, malnutrition, dermatologic conditions, orthopedic injuries, etcâ€¦ It can also reduce mental health difficulties including stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD and other disorders. Psychosocial reactions to trauma are recognized to be among the most long-term and debilitating outcomes of disasters. This presentation describes a community's successful efforts to prevent a major flood disaster in the midst of a changing risk landscape. The authors focus on factors contributing to the resilience of a community in the upper Midwest of the United States in responding to the threat of a catastrophic natural disaster. In addition, the presentation includes the building blocks for successful integration of mental health presence through all phases of disaster: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
