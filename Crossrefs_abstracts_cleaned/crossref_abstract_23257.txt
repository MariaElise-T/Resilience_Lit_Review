Economic activities in disaster-prone areas are significantly susceptible to mountain disasters, and enhancing the resilience of new rural collective economies (RRCEs) is a pressing challenge that needs to be overcome in the areas of disaster risk management and sustainable development. The target research area comprises 48 representative villages in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture (LP). An assessment framework based on the Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) model is established to evaluate the RRCEs in the face of mountain disasters, and the influencing factors regarding the RRCEs are examined. The results show that (1) typical villages in the new rural collective economies (NRCE) have a low level of resilience. (2) Transformational capacity is the key to improving RRCEs. (3) Off-farm villages exhibit the highest level of collective economic resilience, followed by diversified villages, while the lowest resilience level is observed in purely agricultural villages. (4) Talent security and institutional security are important for achieving a high level of resilience. Both of these factors significantly influence RRCEs. (5) The combined influence of talent, financical, institutional, technological, and business security contributes to the diverse factors that shape RRCEs. In other words, the path to achieving resilience in the new rural collective economies is characterized by multiple routes that lead to a common goal. Building on this, we propose recommendations in five key areas, namely, encouraging scientific research and innovation, improving disaster insurance coverage, strengthening the emergency protection system, facilitating collective economic development, and selecting suitable strategies to enhance resilience based on local conditions. The aim is to offer valuable insights for disaster-prone areas to enhance RRCEs and realize sustainable development and rural revitalization.
