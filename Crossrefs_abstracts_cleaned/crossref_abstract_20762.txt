Abstract
Several countries are experiencing economic instability due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, not least Indonesia. This research aims to identify priority aspects that affect the resilience of entrepreneurship in the tourism sector. This research was conducted in the Togean Islands of Tojo Una-Una Regency by interviewing several stakeholders as many as 30 people consisting of business actors. The analysis method used in this study is the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The results in this study showed that social justice criteria were very prominently chosen by respondents compared to other criteria. This shows the social sensitivity possessed by entrepreneurs during the Covid 19 pandemic. This research requires justification in future research to be used as a generalization in terms of entrepreneurial resilience theory in the face of pandemic risk as it is today.
