 Scholars of entrepreneurship among people with disabilities suggest that it is necessary to develop deeper insights into the contextual elements that enable or oppose such entrepreneurship. This study problematizes a core premise of the disability entrepreneurship literature that social support, institutional support or both enact disability entrepreneurship. This study modifies the premise by examining a case from the contextual scenario of a post-Soviet country where both societal and institutional attention to disability are largely inadequate and unfavourable. This case study concerns a blind female dancer in Kazakhstan who developed herself into a successful cultural entrepreneur. This inductive study proposes a process model which is labelled resilient tightroping, a model that enables a person with a disability to move towards empowerment and inclusion. The author is well aware that one cannot generalize from a single case. On the other hand, a single case can identify a deficiency in current thinking and point to additional directions where research is needed.
