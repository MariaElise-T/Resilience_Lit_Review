Abstract
Background
The resilience of nursing home (NH) nursing staff is emphasized to improve the quality of care provided, but the concept has not been clearly defined. By composing such a definition through concept development, a basis for active research in the future can be established.

Aim
To identify the definition and conceptual characteristics of the concept of resilience of NH nursing staffs.

Method
In this study, the concept was developed using Schwartz-Barcott and Kimâ€™s hybrid model, which included theoretical, fieldwork, and final analysis stages. In the theoretical stage, a literature review on the definition and measurement of concepts was performed. For the fieldwork stage, 22 interviews were conducted with 7 participants, and a content analysis was performed. During the final analysis stage, the results of the theoretical and field work stages were integrated.

Results
Three dimensions, eight attributes, and three types were identified. The three dimensions are internal resources, external support, and positive coping with situations as they arise; the eight attributes are optimism, patience, mindfulness, supportive relationships, available resources, work-life boundary setting, self-development, and growth; and the three types are those who want to adapt themselves to the situation, those who actively seek to cope with stressful situations, and those who hold positive expectations for the future.

Conclusion
Coping with difficult situations using internal resources and external support was a unique trait revealed in the resilience of NH nursing staff members. This study provided future research directions to improve the resilience of NH nursing staffs by revealing the characteristics of their resilience.
