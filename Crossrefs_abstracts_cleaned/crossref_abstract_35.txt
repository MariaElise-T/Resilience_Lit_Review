PurposeThis paper aims to address a critical aspect of post‐event recovery, namely the rebuilding of the housing stock following a devastating natural disaster. Using hurricanes as an example, challenges and opportunities are systematically discussed in hopes of sparking some further discussion and new economic models (including incentive‐based) that can help move communities toward greater resiliency and sustainability.Design/methodology/approachAs a viewpoint paper, this paper relies on the author's experience in post‐hurricane damage investigation, structural retrofit, and design to minimize loss.FindingsIn evaluating how best to rebuild following a natural disaster, there are clear opportunities (and needs) in the areas of structural damage/loss mitigation, codes and standards, building material and system selection, and risk communication. Specific suggestions are made in each of these areas and the importance of risk‐based decision is stressed in each area.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the ongoing and informed discussions on resiliency, sustainable design, and disaster‐resistant communities.
