AbstractMany persons exposed to loss or potentially traumatic events manage the stresses of these experiences with minimal to no impact on their daily functioning. The prevalence of this resilient capacity has surprised researchers and clinicians alike and refocused clinical practice. We review three key points about resilience: resilience is different from the process of recovery; resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma is common; and there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience. We then present six clinical practices informed by the study of resilience, illustrating key points with clinical vignettes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
