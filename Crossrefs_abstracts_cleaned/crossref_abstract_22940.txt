Objectives This study aimed to provide basic data necessary for nurse's character education by assessing the influence of nurse’s character with resilience, career aspirations and academic stress among nursing students. Methods From OCT, 2021 to DEC, 2021, the study participants were 126 nursing university students in G, C and J province in korea. Data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Data analysis was done by using SPSS WIN 23.0 program for independent t-test and analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results This study showed positive correlation between nurse’s character and resilience(r=.679, p<.001), career aspirations(r=.593, p<.001). In addition, resilience(β=.568, p<.001), career aspirations(β=.195 p=.026), achievement stress(β=.158 p=.047) have a 49.5%(Adj R2=.509) explanatory power for the nurse’s character in nursing students. Conclusions In order to build up nurse’s character of nursing students, psychological support is required to improve resilience by overcoming academic stress generated in the learning process. Also, it is necessary to develop teaching-learning programs and career-related programs to improve resilience and career aspirations.
