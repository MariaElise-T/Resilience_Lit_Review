AbstractPrevention of stress‚Äêinduced adverse effects is important for animals and humans to maintain their quality of life (QOL). Stress decreases the productivity of farm animals and induces abnormal behaviors, which is one of the major problems in animal welfare. In humans, stress increases the risk of mental illness which adversely impacts QOL. Stress is, thus, a common health problem for both animals and humans, and stress prevention and promotion of stress resilience could improve animal and human health and QOL. Among various stresses, psychosocial stress experienced by individuals is particularly difficult to prevent and it could, thus, prove beneficial to attempt to increase resilience to psychosocial stress. There exist a few critical interventions for promoting such resilience, environmental enrichment being one. However, this review describes recent progress in nutritional interventions that could confer resilience to psychosocial stress. The efficacy of this intervention is studied in the social defeat model mouse, which is a standard model for studying psychosocial stress. Several nutrients were found to rescue stress vulnerability using the models. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics became crucial dietary interventions for combating psychosocial stress. Collectively, dietary intake of appropriate nutrients will be more important for maintaining QOL in animals and humans.
