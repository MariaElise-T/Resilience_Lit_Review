The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Aging defined “successful aging” as active engagement in life, maintenance of high cognitive and physical function, and avoidance of disease (Rowe and Kahn, 1987). Closely aligned with “successful aging” is resilience, that is, the ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity.
