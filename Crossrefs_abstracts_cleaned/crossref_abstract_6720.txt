AbstractTraumatic anthropogenic or natural disasters can redefine the ecological and social diversity of cities, with "new normal" conditions often emerging in post-trauma urban landscapes. The objective of our ULTRA project is to examine how the pace and trajectory of recovery in post-Katrina New Orleans reflect ecological and social diversity. Specifically, we are examining potential parallels and interactions between ecological and social diversity within and among neighborhoods, and across the New Orleans metropolitan area. We are doing so by (1) organizing and coordinating a network of scholars and practitioners to exchange experience and knowledge and thereby advance understanding of connections between diversity and recovery in post-trauma urban ecosystems; (2) assembling a central data archive on the structure and diversity of ecological communities of New Orleans, which involves conducting an inventory of the post-Katrina urban forest; (4) and conducting a GIS-based spatial analysis of pre- and post-trauma landscape and social metrics derived from satellite imagery and the 2000 and 2010 federal census, analyzed for diversification and compared to stabilization metrics. This citywide study is being supplemented with three fine-grained studies in the neighborhoods of the Lower Ninth Ward, Hollygrove, and Pontchartrain Park. Qualitative data collected in these neighborhoods provides insight into the relationships between trauma and ecological and social diversity, and identify variation in the timing, pace, and trajectory of neighborhood recovery. In the future, we will expand our efforts to consider how diversity reflects the availability and valuation of ecosystem services in post-trauma urban landscapes. Our intent is to develop New Orleans as a natural laboratory for the study of ecological and community resiliency.
