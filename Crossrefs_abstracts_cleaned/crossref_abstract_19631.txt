Abstract
We need to understand how psychosocial resources develop, identify the influences that threaten their maintenance, detect the circumstances under which these resources are used, and elucidate the factors that support and promote their growth. Three important components to studying the development of resilience include its dynamic nature, context, and timescale of measurement. Dynamic systems (DS) approaches focus on physiological and psychological structures underling the development of resilience by explicitly mapping parameters of change onto their corresponding aspects of functioning. Previous research has captured emotion regulation within individuals, across traits, and in close personal relationships to show how these methods depict dynamic regulation/resilience resources and their influence on outcomes of interest. The use of multi-time scaled data informs how daily emotion regulation is disrupted in the context of stress to produce dysregulation and disease later in the life course. This approach can also reveal how resilience resources counteract these adverse processes and allow others to thrive and be well. Researchers must not only explore short-term variation in constructs of interest, but also explore how these shorter-term fluctuations contribute to longer-term changes. The confluence of DS, contextual influences, and multiple timescales provides an important set of tools to better understand development.
