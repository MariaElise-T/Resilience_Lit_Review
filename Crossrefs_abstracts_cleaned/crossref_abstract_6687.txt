To scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the degree of urban storm resilience and improve the level of urban stormwater resilience, based on the resilience theory, starting from the three attributes of resilience (resistance, recovery and adaptability), this paper establishes the framework of urban resilience evaluation indicator system under the background of stormwater disaster. Firstly, the weight of the indicator system is analyzed by the Delphi method and cloud model, and then the urban stormwater recilience evaluation model is constructed by using the cloud model and approximate ideal solution ranking method. Through the fuzzy description, the corresponding quantitative value is given to the qualitative indicator, so that the stormwater resilience of the city can be measured by accurate values. Finally, the feasibility of the model is verified by case analysis. The results show that the urban stormwater resilience evaluation theory and method based on cloud model and approximate ideal solution ranking method have important guiding significance to improve the level of urban stormwater resilience.
