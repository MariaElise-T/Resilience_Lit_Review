AbstractIncreased interest in the study of economic resilience emanates from the need to assess how different regions respond to shocks and stresses. This provides a clear and objective determination of resilient and non‐resilient regions and informs the formulation of strategy options for economic resilience. This paper analyses the economic resilience of city‐regions in Zimbabwe and highlights how resilient these cities have been to shocks since 2000. Above all, this paper shows that, among the studied variables, population size, level of infrastructural development and built‐up area density have not had a clear impact on the cities’ economic resilience trends.
