AbstractEnvironmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) is corporate business sustainability for the future and a noble ethical that fosters social, economic and environmental well‐being (EWB) of the community. Based on environmental protection and management, the Indonesian mining company is obliged to mitigate and conserve the surrounding environmental ecosystem. The mining company invested IDR17.35 billion on ECSR since 2006. This study examines the effects of ECSR on EWB of the community by mediating community resilience. The subjects were family household leaders in 12 villages who were direct and indirect recipients of ECSR. Partial least squares‐based structural equation modelling analysis was used to determine the effects of ECSR on the community EWB. In addition, were analysed mediated effects by community resilience (CR). The findings of this study confirmed that ECSR practices had positive and significant effects on CR and EWB. As a mediator, CR significantly contributed to the sustainable EWB of the community.
