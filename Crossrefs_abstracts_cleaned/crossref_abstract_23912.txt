Objective. To investigate the current situation of self-perceived burden in patients with urostomy, analyze the correlation between self-perceived burden and quality of life, and explore the intermediary role of resilience and social support. Methods. The convenience sampling method was used to select 303 patients with urostomy of outpatient departments of the three tertiary hospitals in Yinchuan, Ningxia region, China, from April 1, 2020, to October 1, 2020, who then completed a survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire contained a general data questionnaire and self-perceived burden scale, city of hope-quality of life-ostomy questionnaire, Connor-Davidson resilience scale, and social support rating scale. Results. Self-perceived burden was present among 89.8% patients with urostomy; the quality of life of patients with urostomy is low. The results showed that the self-perceived burden and quality of life, resilience, and social support are related in pairs; self-perceived burden was significantly negatively correlated with quality of lifeï¼Œresilience, and social support; there was a significant positive correlation between quality of life, resilience, and social support; resilience and social support were parallel mediators. Conclusions. Patients with urostomy had a heavy self-perceived burden and low quality of life. Reducing the self-perceived burden of patients with urostomy by improving the level of resilience and social support, could raise the level of quality of life. This study could provide empirical basis for nurses to take continuous nursing intervention measures in order to reduce the self-perceived burden of patients with urostomy and ultimately to improve the quality of life.
