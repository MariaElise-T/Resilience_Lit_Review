The American Psychological Association (APA) announced new treatment guidelines for girls and women earlier this month, taking into account their strength and resilience and the changes in their lives in recent decades regarding education, reproductive and caregiving roles, and personal relationships. The guidelines apply to girls and women of diverse ethnicities and races, abilities, social classes, sexual orientations, gender identities and life experiences.
