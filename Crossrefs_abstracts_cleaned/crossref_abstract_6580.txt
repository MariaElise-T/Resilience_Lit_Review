Destinations around the world are adopting a resilience framework to deal with the increasing frequency and intensity of disasters affecting the tourism industry. However, agreed upon measures and models of resilience by the tourism industry have yet to be determined. This article proposes
 a scalable resilience model for tourism destinations, extending the application of the Regional Tourism Adaptation Framework (RTAF) to diverse types of risks and different size destinations. Specifically, it addresses gaps with the RTAF model and extends the model to address these gaps. As
 such, the article uses theories from the resilience literature as well as knowledge about the tourism industry to build out a more scalable and generalizable model. It further discusses limitations of the model that need to be tested in future studies.
