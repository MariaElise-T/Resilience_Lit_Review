AbstractElectric mobility is fundamental to combat climate change and attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-11). However, electric mobility necessitates a seamless integration between power and transportation systems, as the resiliency of both systems is becoming far more interdependent. Here, we focus on disruption to Battery Electric Bus (BEB) transit system charging infrastructure and offer a resilient BEB transit system planning model. The proposed model optimizes the BEB system costs while ensuring the systemâ€™s robustness against simultaneous charging station failures. In our case study, a single charging station failure would lead to up to 34.03% service reduction, and two simultaneous failures would reduce the service by up to 58.18%. Our proposed two-stage robust model addresses this issue with a relatively small added cost (3.26% and 8.12% higher than the base model). This cost enables uninterrupted BEB system operation during disruption, ensuring personal mobility, social interaction, and economic productivity.
