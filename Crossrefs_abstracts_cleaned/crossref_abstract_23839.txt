To accommodate the growing demand for cloud services, telecom carriers’ networks and datacenter (DC) facilities form large network–cloud ecosystems (ecosystems for short) physically supporting these services. These large-scale ecosystems are continuously evolving and must be highly resilient to support critical services. Open and disaggregated optical-networking technologies promise to enhance the interoperability across telecom carriers and DC operators, thanks to their open interfaces in both the data plane and control/management plane. In the first part of this paper, we focus on a single entity (e.g., a telecom carrier or an emerging telecom/DC partnership company) that owns both the network and DC infrastructures in the ecosystem. We introduce a solution by leveraging open and disaggregated technologies to enhance the resilience of the optical networks within a multi-vendor and multi-domain ecosystem. In the second part of this paper, we consider the case when the networks and DCs are owned by different entities. Also, in this case, cooperation among datacenter providers (DCPs) and carriers is crucial to provide failure/disaster resilience to today’s cloud services. However, such cooperation is more challenging since DCPs and carriers, being different entities, may not disclose confidential information, e.g., detailed resource availability. Hence, we introduce a solution to enhance the resilience of such multi-entity ecosystems through cooperation between DCPs and carriers without violating confidentiality.
