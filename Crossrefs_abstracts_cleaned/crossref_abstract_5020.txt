In addition, areas in remote areas do not yet have an internet signal, to the inability of parents to buy cellphones and quotas because of poverty. For poor families, have a burden and become a problem for online learning activities. In this case, the research further explains the power and efforts of students both socially and economically in supporting online learning activities during the pandemic. Research will be conducted using a descriptive quantitative research method approach. Selection of respondents was carried out by purposive sampling. The Amount of the respondents are 30 people. The resilience of students from poor families is showed by looking for work to help the familyâ€™s economy and looking for a UKT (Single Tuition Fee) deduction facility. the GPA (Gradual Achievement Index) of students during the pandemic did not change significantly or remained at 45 percent.
