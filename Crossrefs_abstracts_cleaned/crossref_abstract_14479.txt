The oil and gas (O&G) sector is a critical energy infrastructure to a Nationâ€™s welfare. As developed as the O&G industry may seem, its aging infrastructure gradually shows numerous challenges to keep up with the growing energy demand, increasing operation costs, and environmental concerns. A robust O&G infrastructure that is risk-free, reliable, and resilient towards expected or unexpected threats can offer an uninterrupted supply of O&G to downstream stakeholders, competitive prices to customers, and better environmental footprints. With the shift towards renewable energy, the notion of sustainable development should be firmly embedded in O&G infrastructure and operations to facilitate the smooth transition towards future renewable energy generation. This paper offers a comprehensive and innovative approach to achieving sustainable development for O&G infrastructure by examining it from a holistic risk, reliability, and resilience (3Rs) perspective. The role of each individual concept and their collective influence on sustainable development in the O&G industry will be thoroughly discussed. Moreover, this paper will highlight the significant impact of the holistic 3Rs approach on sustainable development and propose future research directions. Given the complexity of O&G infrastructure, it is crucial to incorporate sustainable development practices into every dimension of the O&G infrastructure, iteratively and continuously, to achieve the ultimate goal of long-term sustainability. This paper makes a significant contribution to the field by providing valuable insights and recommendations for achieving sustainable development in the O&G industry.
