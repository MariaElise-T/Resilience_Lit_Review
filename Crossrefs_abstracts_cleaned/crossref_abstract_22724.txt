 This article explores techniques for estimating Hospital Acquired Infection prevention potential through strategic nursing care delivery design and applied fuzzy frameworks. To achieve this, it evaluates the use of Fuzzy Logic directed by King’s Theory of Nursing Goal Attainment for developing a HAI resilience process model. The purpose of this model is to estimate the performance of environment of care safety based on the ability of nurses to moderate risk and respond adaptively to certain types of hospital-onset infections through strategic workflow design. The aim of this proposed approach would be to help nurses and infection control specialists in healthcare settings better understand what accessible Systems Science-based frameworks may be instrumental for analyzing and forecasting infection control systems improvement. The benefit of using Fuzzy Frameworks in nursing workflow and environment of care planning is that it allows for the leveraging of crystalized intelligence nursing staff have about their patient demography and unit-based workflow. This process allows nurse work designers to introduce and test targeted process or physical improvement strategies that make sense for their unique circumstances while providing better insight into how these interventions may work holistically with all relevant environment of care operations. This approach is made more powerful when guided by trusted optimal nursing theoretical perspectives such as King’s Theory of Goal Attainment.
