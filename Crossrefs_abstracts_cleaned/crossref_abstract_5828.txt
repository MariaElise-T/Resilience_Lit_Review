The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated the uncertainty of the external environment, meanwhile, the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain is highly complex and fragile, so its probability of disruption is higher and it is more difficult to recover, resulting in delays and shortages of vaccine supply. In order to develop the disruption recovery strategy of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain and optimize the disruption recovery process, a multi-objective model was established and solved. Taking the shortest disruption recovery time, the largest reliability of the supply chain system, and the lowest recovery cost as the objective function, and taking the four dimensions of resilience, namely redundancy, robustness, resourcefulness and agility, as the decision variables, the model uses the nondominated ranking genetic algorithm with elite strategy (NSGA-II) to solve the problem, and uses the Pareto frontier analysis method to optimize the solution set, and the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters in the model is analyzed. Finally, the redundancy, robustness, resourcefulness and agility of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain disruption recovery combination strategy under different decision-making preferences are given.
