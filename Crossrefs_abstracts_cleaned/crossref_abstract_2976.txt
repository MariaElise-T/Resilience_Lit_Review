Abstract
THE precise grading of carbon black has been a problem to rubber manufacturers for years. Empirical specification tests inherited from the paint and ink industries have been used extensively; although they may have great merit in predicting the behavior of a black in paint or ink, they generally tell very little of its value in rubber. Since neither these tests nor the usual stress-strain data showed any great differences that could be associated with type of carbon black, chemists have been inclined to believe in the past that the rubber grade of channel black was quite a uniform material, at least when used in mercaptobenzothiazole stocks. Among the tests which have been used recently in the grading of black is resilience of the cured stock as determined by an impact pendulum. Although superficially it seems to measure no fundamental property of the black, it is a very practical test from a laboratory standpoint and appears to be capable of at least rough correlation with more fundamental properties. It is not a new property; the fact that it is influenced by carbon black is not new; but its application to the separation of blacks within the range of rubber channel black is new, and this phase will be discussed here.
