The coronavirus pandemic invaded every aspect of everyday life; shook individuals’ personal, social, economic, and value systems; and led to a loss of the fundamental sense of safety and predictability, marking a global health emergency. Being exposed to the adverse life events of their clients and working under higher levels of risk, psychotherapists are experiencing increased anxiety and work-related stress. The objective of the study is to acquire a better comprehension of the processes and factors that supported integrative psychotherapists in Greece to promote resilience during the pandemic, to explore possible effective interventions, and to contribute to the limited literature on psychotherapists’ ability to foster positive outcomes for themselves and ultimately for their clients. The study utilised a qualitative perspective, analysed by an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The participants experienced increased distress associated with the pandemic; however, they could develop adaptive strategies to safeguard against these adverse effects and balance personal and professional needs, maintaining resilience. In the professional field, they flexibly used the advantages of the Integrative Approach to adapt to the social conditions and the needs of the clients.
