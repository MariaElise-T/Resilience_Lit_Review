<i>The contemporary security environment indicates non-conventional, asymmetric and
hybrid security threats as potentially the most accurate threats to global and regional
security. Conflict risks in the regional frame strongly depend on strategically aimed
non-military, but hybrid acts. The great powers mostly attempt to achieve their own
interestsâ€™ goals in fulfi llment of self-orientated strategic dominance. The Balkan region is
a crossroads of strongly exposed interest spheres of regional as well as global powers. The
article aims to determine areas of infl uence in the Balkan States that could become targets
of predominantly non-military but hybrid infl uences. Multi-Value Quality Comparative
Analyses (mvQCA) of state power, stability and resilience capacities were used in the
research. The methodology used was based on the approach with multi-valued sets of
variables and conditions. A theoretical framework was based on contemporary theories
of state power and hybrid warfare concept. Used databases were brought together from
generated open source databases of approved international academic or think-tank
organisations. Based on a hypothesis regarding hybrid security threats, a theoretical
framework of understanding of power and analysing a wide spectra of databases, the
article aims to contribute a rational and objective understanding of two main indicators:
the potential to become a target and the resilience capacities of countries in the face of
hybrid security threats. Its findings indicate that most countries in the Balkan region are
potentially under unarmed influences and have very low resilience capabilities against possible hybrid infl uences. The conclusions reached help to clarify that the Balkan States
are vulnerable to hybrid security threats.</i>
