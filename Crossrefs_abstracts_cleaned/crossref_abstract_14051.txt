Objective: To examine the relationship between social capital and potential resilience at the individual level from the perspective of emergency management.Methods: The authors used an online survey tool to present various scales of measurement related to the variables of social capital and potential resilience. Results: It was predicted that social capital and demographics, such as income, would be positively related to potential resilience. Overall, results indicated that income (β = 0.33, p < 0.01) and social capital (β = 0.32, p < 0.01) were both significant predictors of potential resilience. Implications and future directions for research and practices are discussed.
