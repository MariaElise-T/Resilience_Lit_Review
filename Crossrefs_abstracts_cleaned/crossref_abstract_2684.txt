The Covid 19 pandemic has re-emphasized the requirement of a robust medical community, which can be accomplished
primarily through their physical and mental well-being. The present study investigated the relationship between
psychological distress and resilience of medical students and the possible effects (protective/detrimental) that sociodemographic variables such
as gender and socioeconomic status may have on these study variables. For this purpose, 222 medical students were selected through convenient
sampling method and assessed using Kessler's psychological distress scale and the resilience scale. The data obtained were analysed using
nonparametric tests. A moderate, negative correlation was observed between psychological distress and resilience of medical students. Gender
differences in the variables were revealed; males possess better resilience and lower psychological distress, while the reverse was true for
females. Differences in psychological distress based on socioeconomic status showed those above average in socioeconomic status experiencing
higher psychological distress and differing signicantly from those below average and average in socioeconomic status. However, no signicant
differences were observed in resilience on the basis of socioeconomic status. The study lends credence to the importance of mental health
awareness and the need for mental health care services to be easily accessible to medical students, to ameliorate their well-being.
