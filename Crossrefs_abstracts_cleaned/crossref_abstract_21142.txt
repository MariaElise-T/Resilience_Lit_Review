To promote the resilient and coordinated development of regional economies, in this study, to construct an index system, we used the entropy weight method to measure the agricultural economic resilience of 11 prefecture-level cities in Jiangxi province, China during 2011–2020, and we analyzed the characteristics of their spatial-temporal pattern evolution. We used the Theil index method to analyze the main sources of their spatial differences. The results showed that: First, the mean value of agricultural economic resilience of prefecture-level cities in Jiangxi trended upward during 2011–2020. Among the prefecture-level cities, Ganzhou had the highest mean agricultural economic resilience value, while Yingtan had the lowest. From the perspective of regional division, the agricultural economy in southern Jiangxi was the most resilient, whereas that in northeast Jiangxi was the least. Second, since 2011, the overall difference in agricultural economic resilience in the four regions of Jiangxi has trended downward, with the inter-regional difference being the main source of the overall difference. Based on this, we provide the following policy implications: first, to continuously enhance the intrinsic dynamics of the agricultural economic resilience and strengthen policy support in Jiangxi; second, to coordinate the development of regional agricultural economic resilience and achieve overall improvement.
