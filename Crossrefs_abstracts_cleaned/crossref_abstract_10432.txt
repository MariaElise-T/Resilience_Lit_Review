The medical course is known to be demanding and critical. However, the relationship between resilience and medical students' psychological distress is barely known. This study investigated resilience and psychological distress among third-year UiTM medical students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 166 medical students in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) in 2019, assessing resilience and psychological distress. The mean score of resilience was 26.6. The study found that 38.0% had depressive symptoms, 31.9% reported anxiety, and 70.5% showed stress symptoms. A higher level of resilience was significantly associated with lower psychological distress.
Keywords: resilience, psychological distress, medical students.
