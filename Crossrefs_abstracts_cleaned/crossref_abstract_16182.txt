Abstract
Covid-19 Pandemic has changed all sectors, one of which is the system in education. Teachers and students are required to learn from home through online learning, it affects the mathematical resilience of students. This research is motivated by the number of findings of decreased student resilience in learning mathematics. The purpose of this study is to examine: (1) Steps of online learning by teachers (2) Mathematical resilience of students during online learning (3) students responses for online learning. The method in this research is descriptive qualitative, the sample selected as many as 4 teachers and 6 students with high, medium and low abilities in one junior high school in Cimahi. Data collection techniques used questionnaires for students to study students ‘mathematical resilience during online learning, interviews to examine students’ responses to online learning, and interviews and observations with teachers to analyze the steps of online learning that were carried out. The results of the study show: 1) The online learning process begins with handouts through Google Classroom, followed by an explanation of the material using a zoom meeting and assignments through the Google Classroom (2) Student resilience of mathematics is high during online learning. (3) students give positive responses for online learning.
