In the study, it was aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological resilience levels of female football players. The sample of the research consists of 276 female football players selected by convenience sampling method. As a data collection tool, the "Emotional Intelligence Trait Scale (TE1Qqu-SF) Short Form" scale and the "Short Psychological Resilience Scale" were adapted and used in the last part. The data that obtained from female football players were analyzed statistically with the SPSS package program. The statistical information of the participants was evaluated by using the descriptive survey method in the study. First of all, validity and reliability analyzes were performed by looking at the Cronbach Alpha values of the scales. Skewness and kurtosis values were evaluated statistically by Normal Distribution test analysis. After examining the skewness and kurtosis values of the study group, the hypotheses of socio-demographic variables were tested and correlation analysis was performed. As a result, while no significant difference was found in female football players according to marital status and athlete's age, it was found that there was a positive relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological resilience.
