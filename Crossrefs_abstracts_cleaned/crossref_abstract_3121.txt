A number of recent papers have determined the compliance of steel studs for use in models for predicting the sound insulation of cavity stud walls. However, in these papers, the compliance of resilient channel bars on one or both sides of wood studs or on one side of steel studs has not been determined across the whole of the frequency range. The present paper determines the compliance of the combination of resilient channel bars, mounted on wooden or steel studs and modeled as point or as line connections. Steel studs have usually been modeled as line connections. In this paper, they are also modeled as point connections where the points are the screws attaching the wall leaves to the steel studs and individual results rather than average results are analyzed. The compliance that makes Davy's sound insulation predictions agree with experimental sound insulation data was calculated by inverting Davy's equations for sound insulation. Linear regressions of the logarithm of the compliance, against the logarithms of frequency, reduced surface density, cavity depth and number of point connections or stud spacing, were conducted in a low frequency range and in a high frequency range.
