The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework aims to understand how early life exposures shape lifecycle health. To date, no comprehensive list of these exposures and their interactions has been developed, which limits our ability to predict trajectories of risk and resiliency in humans. To address this gap, we developed a model that uses text-mining, machine learning, and natural language processing approaches to automate search, data extraction, and content analysis from DOHaD-related research articles available in PubMed. Our first model captured 2469 articles, which were subsequently categorised into topics based on word frequencies within the titles and abstracts. A manual screening validated 848 of these as relevant, which were used to develop a revised model that finally captured 2098 articles that largely fell under the most prominently researched domains related to our specific DOHaD focus. The articles were clustered according to latent topic extraction, and 23 experts in the field independently labelled the perceived topics. Consensus analysis on this labelling yielded mostly from fair to substantial agreement, which demonstrates that automated models can be developed to successfully retrieve and classify research literature, as a first step to gather evidence related to DOHaD risk and resilience factors that influence later life human health.
