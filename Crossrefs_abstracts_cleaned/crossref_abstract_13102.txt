The paper describes how the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide supply and demand crunch for medical supplies such as masks and Personal protective equipment (PPE), causing a break in the supply chain. The application of circular economy concepts to supply chains creates resilient supply chains by reducing dependence on external inputs and outputs to help business cope with unforeseen disasters. The resilient supply chain is enhanced by applying the "3R" principle of value recapture in the circular economy model, i.e. reduce, reuse and recycle, and also by drawing on economic models such as platform economy and sharing economy.
