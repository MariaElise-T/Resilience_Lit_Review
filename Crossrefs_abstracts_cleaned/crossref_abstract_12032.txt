Resilience is an increasingly present term in contemporary media and scientific discourse. The understanding of this term is achieved by placing it in the immediate linguistic context and by identifying other terms of the lexico-semantic field in which the term resilience falls. In this sense, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, which allow addressing and understanding the complexity of the modern world and the present, could support us in our quest to explain and understand this term with a complex semantics and applicability in several fields of life and science.
