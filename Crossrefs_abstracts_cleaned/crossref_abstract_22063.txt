AbstractAimTo investigate the association of resilience with self‐care and quality of life in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.DesignCross‐sectional study.MethodsData were collected between February and May 2021. Self‐care was measured with the self‐care of chronic illness inventory, quality of life was measured with the clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire and resilience was measured with the resilience evaluation scale. Possible confounders were included (sex, age, smoking, time since diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, educational level, social support and pulmonary function). Multiple regression analysis was performed among the determinants, confounders and both outcomes.ResultsParticipants scored fairly well on resilience (mean 22.5). Self‐care scored reasonably well (mean maintenance 65.9, mean monitoring 70.9, mean management 59.9 and mean confidence 71.5). Quality of life scored mediocre (mean 2.6). The results of the linear multiple regression were resilience, which is associated with self‐care confidence and quality of life when adjusted for possible confounders. This means people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with higher resilience have better self‐care confidence and higher quality of life. The outcome contributes to strengthening nursing care and further developing nurses' knowledge. The results can contribute to increasing awareness for healthcare professionals that resilience can potentially increase self‐care and quality of life.
