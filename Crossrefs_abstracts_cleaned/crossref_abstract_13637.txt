Several studies had explored compassion and resilience, however, most of these studies focused on the relationship between resilience and compassionate fatigue, or resilience and self-compassion.
This study aimed to determine the level of emerging resilience and level of compassion of pediatric emergency nurses while caring for COVID 19 pediatric patients and the correlation between Compassion level and Emerging Resilience of nurses.
Participants were 190 emergency nurses conducted in Pediatric Emergency Center COVID-19 facility. The study data were collected utilizing the questionnaire comprised of demographics, Compassionate Scale and Brief Resilience Scale.
Statistically significant difference was found between the age variable of the nurses and “common humanity” sub-scale as well as years in service and sub-scale “Indifference items”. There was a significant difference between the education level of the nurses and their status of showing kindness to the patients (p < .05). When the subscales were added together, there was no significant difference between the Compassionate Scale total score and the baseline characteristics of the nurses. In terms of Brief Resilience Scale, a mean score of 3.18 (±0.47) was found that showed the resilience level of the nurses as normal. Significant difference between educational status and brief resilience scale (p<.05) was found.
The level of compassion of the nurses was “moderate” and the Resilience was “normal resilient coping.” Nurses’ baseline data negatively predicted the level of compassion and the emerging resilience of Pediatric Emergency Nurses. There was no correlation between the Nurses’ Level of compassion with the Nurses’ level of resilience.
