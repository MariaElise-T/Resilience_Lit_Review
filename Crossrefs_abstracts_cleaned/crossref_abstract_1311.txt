In multifamily buildings, the floor/ceiling assembly between living units needs to be sound rated. In North America, a common light-frame floor construction involves wood or cold-formed metal joists spaced at 400 mm. The typical practice is to attach a gypsum board ceiling to the underside of the floor framing using narrow strips of ‘‘Z’’-shaped thin metal called ‘‘resilient channels.’’ If the resilient channels or the ceiling are installed incorrectly, the low-frequency sound insulation of the assembly can be seriously degraded. Based on our experience with resilient ceiling construction, there are two significant factors that have not yet been documented in an acoustical laboratory. One factor is to maintain a small separation around the entire perimeter of the ceiling where it intersects vertical wall surfaces (this void is later sealed airtight with a flexible caulking material). A second is the particular design of the Z-shaped resilient channel. The paper will discuss findings from two acoustical test series of floor/ceiling assemblies in wood-frame buildings. In both cases, the assembly was tested before and after modifications to the perimeter of the existing resilient ceiling. Each of the series also included tests of a complete ceiling reconstruction using an improved resilient channel design.
