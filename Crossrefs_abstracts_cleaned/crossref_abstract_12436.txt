Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change and short duration and higher temperatures eventually reduced yields of crops white encouraging weed and pest proliferation. the changes in precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of short- run crop failure and long run production decline Climate resilient technologies are promising tool to guard a farming system from climatic variations. National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) has demonstrated, and promoted application of climate resilient technologies in most vulnerable 100 districts. Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Wyra received NICRA project in the year 2010- 2011 to 2110 - 2011. Many climate resilient technologies were briefed to the farmers in the selected villages.Â  The farmers distinguished the demonstrated technologies to the farmers were adopted with ease. Majority of the NICRA beneficiaries have high adoption to the climate resilient technologies while few of non beneficiaries adopted the technologies.
