The circumstances which favoured the expansion of state welfare in the 
post-war ‘golden age’ – secure growth, full employment, moderate 
welfare needs and national politico-economic autonomy – have been 
reversed in the ‘silver age’ of labour market restructuring, demographic 
transition and economic globalisation. Most researchers argue that the 
European welfare settlement is (so far) surprisingly resilient in the face of 
current challenges. This article argues that analysis of welfare states has 
been approached from two basic directions – quantitative analysis and 
comparative case study – and that each approach has its merits and difficulties. 
Using the example of pensions policy it show that quantitative 
methods tend to produce findings which place greater emphasis on continuity 
and resilience, while case studies focus attention more on political 
processes. The latter approach is likely to provide greater insight into 
shifts that may lead to new policy directions in the immediate future. The 
picture presented by the quantitative method tends to predominate in 
comparative cross-national studies of the response of welfare states to 
current pressures, and this may overemphasise stability and resilience 
against discontinuity and change.
