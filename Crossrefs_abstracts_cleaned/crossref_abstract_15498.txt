The dynamically changing world poses new challenges to urbanized areas, e.g., related to water management in the architectural and urban context. Improving retention and strengthening blue-green infrastructure can be based on technical, semi-natural and natural methods, which are less invasive. Various forms are used in the city space: flow control, detention, retention, filtration, infiltration, and treatment. The implementation of the green order strategy and shaping sustainable development in the context of designing the cityâ€™s resilience is associated with shaping spatial policy and urban planning assumptions for the transformation of public spaces and new investments in urbanized areas in crisis. The shaping of waterfronts in the city and green and blue infrastructure significantly shape the parameters of the environment and the regenerative capacity of the urban ecosystem. The aim of this work was to show the relationship between the problem of embankments and the possibilities of developing space in their proximity, including areas exposed to the risk of flooding. The relationships determined by the goal were verified in comparative studies, a repeatable method of collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting the obtained data was used. The issue was presented in a broader context of flood risk and water management in the area of Lake Zegrze, collisions and spatial conflicts were analyzed. The results are presented in the context of detailed water management data for the complex of Riva Zegrze facilities, which is a model example regarding the sustainable development of areas on embankments, considering their specific floodplain development possibilities. The effects of the research allowed for the formulation of conclusions, including in terms of implementation, in the field of urban and architectural design for areas associated with an embankment.
