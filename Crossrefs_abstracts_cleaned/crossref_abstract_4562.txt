Optimizing the management of hydraulic infrastructures that support water supply, wastewater, and stormwater drainage can increase the efficiency of these systems. A framework for operational management of urban water systems allows for robust management, which contributes to the system’s overall resilience. A methodology has been structured to support the decision-making process of managing entities. The methodology for the operational management of hydraulic infrastructures incorporates concepts of asset management, risk management, and technical management. It is organized into three operational areas (assessment, operation, and intervention) and aims to increase the efficiency of managing entities. Two cases were used to implement the aforementioned methodology—the Arouca Water Supply System (SAA-Arouca) and the Trofa Wastewater Drainage System (SAR-Trofa), both under the responsibility of Águas do Norte, S.A. In SAA-Arouca. There was a particularly significant reduction in the system input volume (purchased the first level) and the number of pipe busts observed in the subsequent period after the implementation of the methodology. Regarding the SAR-Trofa, the application of the methodology focused particularly on improper inflows (rainwater and others). The proposals for this system mainly aim at reducing the volumes collected by the drainage networks (in low-level infrastructures) and delivering them to different high-level infrastructures.
