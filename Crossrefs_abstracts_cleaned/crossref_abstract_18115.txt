The present study was conducted with the aim to find out the relationship between resilience, mindfulness and mental health problems among COVID-19 Survivors. Data was collected online and COVID-19 survivors were recruited from general population. It was hypothesized that resilience, mindfulness does not have a significant positive relationship with mental health problems in “COVID-19” survivors. The correlation research design was used to analyze the relationship in study variables. Convenient and snowball sampling technique was used on a total number of N=200 COVID-19 survivors including 100 male and 100 female. To find out Resilience, Mindfulness and Mental Health Problems, Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, (Connor & Davidson, 2003), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, (Brown & Ryan, 2003), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), was used respectively. SPSS (statistical package for social sciences) software was used to analyze the data. Descriptive analyses were used to determining mean and its frequency. To see the differences and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test (to compare mean between two populations) were used. The finding illustrated that resilience and mindfulness were significantly correlated with each other whereas resilience and stress showed significant mean difference in gender groups. Likewise resilience also showed significant mean difference result in family system and marital status.
