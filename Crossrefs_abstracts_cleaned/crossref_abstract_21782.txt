After a disaster, the recovery sequence of damaged bridges in a roadâ€“bridge transportation system greatly influences system restoration time and total economic loss. In this paper, the skew of recovery trajectory is introduced to evaluate the average restoration time, and the total economic loss is extended to consider the indirect loss, such as the energy consumption of detours or the emergency service fee. So, the post-disaster resilience optimization model is constructed by minimizing the total economic loss. The improved genetic algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal recovery scheme for damaged bridges by considering the recovery sequence and repair modes. The composition and influence factors of total economic loss are analyzed through three experiments. The experimental results show that the indirect loss accounts for approximately half of the economic loss, while the higher price of emergency service promotes the reduction of indirect loss using the expedited modes to repair damaged bridges. Moreover, to minimize the total economic loss, it is essential to design the optimal recovery scheme (repair sequence and repair mode) wisely to balance the conflicts between indirect loss and direct loss.
