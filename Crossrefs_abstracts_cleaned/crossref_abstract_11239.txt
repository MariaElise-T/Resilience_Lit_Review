Justification and objective: The physiological changes that accompany human aging increase the risk of disease and care dependence. To meet the health needs of older adults, care must go beyond diagnosing specific diseases and assess the impact of these conditions on functional capacity. The concepts of intrinsic capacity and physical resilience aim to explain the trajectory of various health outcomes in older adults. The case presented below illustrates the positive impact of intrinsic capacity, together with external resources, on the prognosis of an older patient during a catastrophic health event. Case description: A 91-year-old widower was diagnosed with severe dehydration, delirium, pneumonia, and a grade IV pressure injury after lying in his home for 6 days. He remained hospitalized for 87 days and was discharged with almost complete recovery of his functional capacity. Discussion: The main point of this case is the positive health outcome experienced by a nonagenarian patient given the severity of the events. From the perspective of intrinsic capacity, he was functionally independent, had good sensory function, excellent cognition and vitality, and his psychological status was positive. He is currently progressing towards complete functional recovery.
