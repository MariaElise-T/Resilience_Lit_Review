The relations of regulation and emotionality to elementary school children's social functioning were examined. Teachers and peer reproted on children's social functioning; I parent and teacher rated children on various measures of regulation, resiliency, and emotionality; and a behavioural index of regulation was obtained. The effects of individual differences in attentional regulation on social status and socially appropriate behavior were mediated by resiliency, and dispositional negative emotionality moderated the positive relation between attentional control and resiliency (with this path being stronger for children high in negative emotinality). The effects of behavioural regulation were not mediated by resiliency; however, the relation of behavioral regulation to socilaly appropriate behaviour (but not social status) was moderated by negative emotionality, with effects being significant and higher for children high in negative emotionality.
