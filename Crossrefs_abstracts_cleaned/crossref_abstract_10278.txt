The present study was conducted to determine the relationship between compassionate and self-image goals with academic resilience among undergraduate students. For this study, Compassionate and Self-Image Goals Scale developed by Crocker and Canevello (2008) and Academic Resilience Scale developed by Cassidy (2016) were used. The study was conducted with 140 undergraduate students at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. Participants were selected through a simple random sampling method. The correlation technique was used to analyze the data. The results revealed that more females had compassionate goals in comparison to males. The findings also revealed that students having compassionate goals were highly academically resilient. The result also highlighted that students belonging to science faculty having compassionate goals were highly academically resilient in comparison to students belonging to non-science faculty. It further revealed that students having self-image goals belonging to science and non-science faculties were not highly academically resilient.
