Abstract
Natural and technical disasters are abrupt and have a huge impact on relatively broad regions, yet little research has examined how local organizations overcome institutional collective action dilemmas in collaborative emergency management. Since simply participating in collective agreements and adopting coordination plans are inadequate for achieving effective collaboration in emergency situations, this research aims to test whether organizationsâ€™ decisions to engage in joint emergency programs are sufficient for building resilient emergency response networks. We systemically design a Heckman selection model with two stages by utilizing data derived from the 2012 and 2013 emergency management surveys conducted before and after the 2012 Korean typhoons. The results demonstrate how a strong commitment though participation in joint exercises significantly influences disaster than formal planning and network affiliations. The findings imply that network interactions forged by such full-scale exercises reduce transaction costs of collaboration and improve community resilience.
