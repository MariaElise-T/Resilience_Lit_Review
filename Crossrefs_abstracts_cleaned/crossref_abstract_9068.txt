 The article presents a new simplified model for measuring the resilience of a hospital Emergency Department during a seismic event. The waiting time is used as performance parameter which is first evaluated using a discrete event simulation model of the Emergency Department. Then, a metamodel has been developed from the results of the discrete event simulation model for different emergency codes considering the amplitude of the seismic input and the number of resources available right after the seismic event. Results show that when an earthquake occurs, generating a seismic wave of injured patients going to the Emergency Department, the maximum waiting time is approximately 13â€‰h when an emergency plan is not applied. Instead, if the emergency rooms are not functional, due to earthquake damages, the waiting time increases dramatically and the Emergency Department is no more able to provide a proper service to the incoming patients. The proposed Emergency Department model can be used not only to evaluate the performance of existing hospitals during an emergency, but also to design the proper size of a new Emergency Department in a region.
