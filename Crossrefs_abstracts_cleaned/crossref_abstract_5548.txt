AbstractUrgent action is needed to ensure the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030. Under climate change the intensity and frequency of heatwaves are projected to increase and urgent action is also needed to improve heatwave resilience now and in the future. Yet, it remains unclear how countries are planning and implementing policies and actions for this to happen. Interactions between the SDGs have been widely researched. However, little is known about the interactions between the SDGs and heatwave resilience. In response, this study focuses on mapping such interactions. This mixed methods study design with a diverse group of stakeholders from different sectors of society identified key interactions, sources of interactions and solutions for achieving both agendas. The analysis revealed that: (i) synergies largely outweigh trade-offs; (ii) a broad compatibility exists between the two agendas; (iii) no fundamental incompatibilities were found, and; (iv) the two agendas are not being consistently aligned. These findings are essential for parallel and effective achievement of both agendas and to enhance synergies and reduce trade-offs. A series of solutions were identified which can be implemented. Such integrated approaches would enhance success and overall performance by improving collaborations, using common language, regulation and planning, pooling resources, skills, inclusive information and translation to practice.
