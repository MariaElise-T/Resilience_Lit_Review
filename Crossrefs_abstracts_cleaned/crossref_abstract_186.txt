 This paper describes a computational design-support tool created in response to safe-distancing measures enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool was developed for a specific use case: understanding congestion in crowded migrant worker dormitories that experienced high rates of COVID-19 transmission in 2020. Building from agent-based and network-based computational simulations, the tool presents a hybrid method for simulating building resident movements based on known or pre-determined schedules and likely itineraries. This hybrid method affords the design tool a novel approach to simultaneous exploration of spatial and temporal design scenarios. The paper demonstrates the use of the tool on an anonymised case study of a high-density migrant worker dormitory, comparing results from a baseline configuration against design variations that modify dormitory physical configuration and schedule. Comparisons between the design scenarios provide evidence for reflections on pandemic-resilient design and operation strategies for dormitories. A conclusions section considers the extent to which the model and case study results are applicable to other dense institutional buildings and describes the paperâ€™s contributions to general understanding of configurational and operational aspects of resilience in the built environment.
