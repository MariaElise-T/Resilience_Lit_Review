As drug trends change globally, risks affecting individuals and families from diverse backgrounds become more complex. To critically examine the contexts that foster drug abuse, the authors developed a conceptual model that identifies factors that predispose toward or protect individuals from drug use and abuse. The model utilizes an ecological risk and resilience framework for understanding drug problems in India. There are risk factors that increase the likelihood of drug use, abuse, dependence, and secondary problems. Alternatively, effective protective (resilience) factors at all levels of the system have the potential to reduce risk for drug dependence and its repercussions. The authors posit that this model can help guide research, evaluation, and program planning related to drug abuse and other social issues. The model can be replicated to address impacts on individuals, families, and communities in other cultures and cross‚Äêcultural comparisons can be made.
