This paper utilizes a resilience perspective and a review of research to identify societal, community, family, and individual factors related to the after-school period that place many children at increased risk for poor developmental and behavioral outcomes. We define and discuss the importance of four key dimensions of children's after-school experiences: safety, developmental appropriateness, cultural relevance, and stability. We recommend that families and practitioners collaborate and include children in the decision making to create after-school care that is individualized. Whenever possible, after-school settings should include opportunities for both enhancing academic achievement and having fun. While emphasizing that all children need appropriate after-school environments, we discuss the importance of assessment and of plan development and monitoring when working with youths at risk for aggressive behavior, impaired relationships with peers and adults, and poor performance in school.
