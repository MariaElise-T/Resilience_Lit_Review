Introduction: Patients with dental anxiety avoid receiving medical care. This anxiety poses a threat to oral health. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of muscle relaxation training and mindfulness training on fear and resilience in patients with dental anxiety. Methods: This was a clinical trial (pretest-posttest design and a control group). The statistical population comprised all patients with dental anxiety who went to dental clinics in the city of Ahvaz in 2018-2019. The research sample included 45 patients with dental anxiety selected through convenience sampling. The participants were randomly divided into two experimental (muscle relaxation training and mindfulness training) and one control group (n=15 each). The research tools included the Dental Fear Survey (DFS), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS). Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data. Results: The mean±standard deviation (SD) of the post-test scores of fear and resilience were 49.53±9.67 and 84.80±7.89 in the muscle relaxation training group and 58.26±12.67 and 55.60±8.83 in the mindfulness training group, which were significantly different from the control groups (83.80±3.50 and 40.46±5.65). Muscle relaxation training reduced fear and increased resilience in patients with dental anxiety in the experimental groups compared to the control group (P<0.001). Furthermore, in terms of fear and resilience in patients with dental anxiety, muscle relaxation training and mindfulness training were significantly different (P<0.001). Conclusion: In addition to decreasing fear, muscle relaxation training and mindfulness can increase resilience in patients with dental anxiety. Also, muscle relaxation training was more effective than mindfulness training in reducing fear and increasing resilience in patients with dental anxiety.
