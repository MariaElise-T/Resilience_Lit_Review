IntroductionResilience is described as a process where an individual mobilizes his personal and external resources to overcome stressors and trauma. As a consequence, researchers tried to identify the factors that contribute to resilience with the aim of developing valid psychological interventions that target resilience. Many authors have stated that personality traits represent an important category of predictors of resilience. The most important relationships were found between high levels of extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability and resilience.Material and methodsWe relied on a community sample (N = 252, Mage = 26.38, SD = 10.17, 62.5% women, 39.5% men) to test the hypothesized indirect relationship between the Big Five personality traits, self-determination, and resilience. The participants were voluntarily recruited from various social media platforms. The participants completed measures of Big Five personality factors, self-determination, and resilience.ResultsWe found that all the Big Five factors were positively related to resilience. Impersonal orientation (low self-determination) mediated the relationship between extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness on the one hand and resilience on the other hand.ConclusionsRelying on the low impersonal orientation components (e.g., sense of competence, determination, lack of anxiety, or depression) scientists and practitioners can enhance resilience by teaching their clients to be more self-determined. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
