Sustainable development entails socio-economic wellbeing, which is often threatened by weather hazards. Indeed, the need to minimise the adverse impact of climate change and extreme weather events cannot be overstressed. Notably, damage to the built environment by extreme weather and its consequential effects is highly significant. This emphasises the need for a climate-resilient built environment. Thus, this study derived the strategic capability areas required by business organisations to achieve the flood resilience of their built environment. The research method involved rounds of review by a carefully selected team of experts, and the review of lessons from four case studies. Twenty-six capability areas were identified from literature but were consolidated to nineteen at the end of data collection and analysis. The capability areas covered how properties are used and managed as well as the actual fabric and design of business premises/properties. The capability areas included awareness and understanding of flood risk to property, review for a flood resilience scheme, product acquisition for flood risk management, dynamic stakeholder identification and strong network, maintenance and post-flood management scheme, physical characteristics of the property and business data management. Professionals and business organisations can use the outcome of this study as a guide for business premises flood resilience enhancement planning and decision making.
