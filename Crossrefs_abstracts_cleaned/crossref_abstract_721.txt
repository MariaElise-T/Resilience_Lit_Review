PurposeThe study aims at creating a sequence of implementing supply chain enablers to achieve a greater efficiency in the combination by establishing relationship among them.Design/methodology/approachTo build resilience capability in supply chain, enablers have been first identified through literature review and experts' opinion. The shortlisting of enablers is done in a brainstorming session having experts from academia and industry. The methodology Automated Layout Design Program (ALDEP), which is being used for creating facility layout, is applied to understand the relationship among the enablers for a resilient supply chain.FindingsThe methodology ALDEP is applied to explore relationship among five enablers shortlisted after discussion with experts. The layout matrix with the highest score between enablers is taken as a basis to establish relationship between two enablers that an organization can use to build a resilient supply chain.Originality/valueThe study uses a novel method helping organizations to build resilient supply chains. This study will not only provide a starting point but also provide an entire model for building a resilient supply chain.
