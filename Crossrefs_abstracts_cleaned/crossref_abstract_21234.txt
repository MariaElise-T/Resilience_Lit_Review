Abstract
Despite positive improvements in health care, older persons living with HIV (PWH) still face psychosocial challenges and medical issues that affect their overall quality of life (QoL). Intrapersonal resilience resources may serve as a protective factor allowing PWH to better cope with adversity, thereby improving their well-being. In our systematic review, we examined intrapersonal resilience resources and their association with QoL outcomes among middle-aged and older PWH (â‰¥40 years). Four databases (CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase) were searched, and 1,400 articles were yielded. Following screening and full-text review, 19 studies met full criteria and were included. Based on our findings from these studies, trait resilience, spirituality, and self-efficacy were the most common resilience resources investigated. Resilience resources were positively associated with QoL outcomes and mediated the association between various psychosocial factors (e.g., stigma) and QoL. Future studies should explore resilience resources and QoL over time among diverse populations of PWH.
