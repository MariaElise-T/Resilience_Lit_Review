This study examined personal well-being, mental resilience, and emotional intelligence in the first- and second-generation Druze population in the Golan Heights using qualitative and quantitative methods. One hundred Druze respondents completed four questionnaires (emotional intelligence, mental resilience, demographics, personal well-being), and eight participated in semi-structured interviews. One hypothesis was that the first generation (ages 40-62) who lived through the Six-Day War in 1967 when Israel occupied the Syrian-ruled Golan Heights and the annexation process in 1981, would have lower levels of personal well-being and emotional intelligence than the second generation (ages 25-40) who were born and raised in Israel and did not experience these events. Another hypothesis was that the first generation, having experienced those events, would have higher mental resilience than the second generation. Â The findings showed that the second generation had higher levels of personal well-being and emotional intelligence than the first generation. However, mental resilience levels were higher in the second generation than the first. The findings indicated that memories of the stressful historical events and the sense of loyalty to Syria result in an emotional burden that exposes a low level of resilience. The levels of mental resilience predicted emotional intelligence levels and personal well-being, regardless of generational affiliation. This study's findings may be expanded to describe other communities that have undergone similar political upheaval.
