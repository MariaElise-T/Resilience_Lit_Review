Abstract. This paper reviews more than 19â€‰691 French historical documents from 14
French archive centres. To assess data from historical documents, a method
has been applied that leads to a record of 101 extreme storms with damage,
including 38 coastal floods. Thus, the results show periods of increasing and
decreasing storm frequency. These periods are examined. Furthermore, coastal
hazards have forced societies to adapt and develop specific skills,
lifestyles and coping strategies. This paper analyses some responses of past
societies to these hazards. By doing so, useful ideas may be (re)discovered
by today's communities in order to enable us to adapt and develop resilience.
Similarly, a thorough knowledge of past meteorological hazards may allow our
societies to recreate a link with territory, particularly through the
(re)construction of an effective memory of these phenomena.
