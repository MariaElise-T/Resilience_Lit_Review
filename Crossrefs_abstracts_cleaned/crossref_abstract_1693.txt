This study analyzed community resiliency by evaluating access to essential delivery services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from October 2020 to September 2021 in a stated-preference survey about delivery services in Southwest Virginia. A significantly larger proportion of respondents without vehicle access relied on third-party restaurant app delivery use than those with a vehicle. Compared to more urban areas, respondents who lived in rural locations were three times more unsatisfied with delivery services due to a lack of accessibility to stores and delivery options.
