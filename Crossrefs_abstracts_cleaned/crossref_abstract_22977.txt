Overcoming classroom challenges is not always straightforward. It is well-known that educators face stress due to various reasons, such as familiar problems, overwork, multiple activities of the teacher, student problems, new methodologies and teaching tools, etc. As a university professor we perceive innumerable situations where students cannot control and / or solve their own conflicts, therefore, they allow these problems to affect their personal, social, physical and even mental health. This research aimed to explore how university educators in the Lambayeque region perceive the relationship between resilience and Burnout Syndrome. The sample comprised 300 faculty members from accredited institutions in Lambayeque. This study used a quantitative, non-experimental, descriptive correlational design. Questionnaires on resilience and Burnout Syndrome were employed since they have proven to be valid, reliable, and supported by substantial evidence. The results demonstrated a statistically significant association between the two variables, with a moderate negative correlation (sig. 0.05), lending credibility to the alternative hypothesis. Among the surveyed professors, 61.7% expressed intentions to focus on becoming more resilient, while 36.37% stated they exhibited external symptoms of the aforementioned condition. According to the findings, the risk of educators developing this condition decreases as they enhance their resilience.
