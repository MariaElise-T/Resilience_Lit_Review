AbstractThe cyclic loading frequency (fcyc) effects on the resilient modulus (Mr) of freezing–thawing coarse–fine mixtures geomaterials (FTCFG) have always been a research hotspot. A series of long-term cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on FTCFG having different fines content (FC) under different number of freeze–thaw cycles (NFT) to investigate the effect of fcyc and deviator stress amplitude (qcyc) on the Mr of FTCFG. The freezing–thawing cyclic was found to improve the Mr of FTCFG. Additionally, Mr of FTCFG shown an obviously rate-dependent characteristics. Then three kinetic effects (rate effect, piston effect, and fatigue effect) are discussed in systemically which are related to qcyc, fcyc and moisture holding capacity (wh). Finally, a rate dependent model of long-term resilient modulus was developed to predict FTCFG materials’ resilient moduli as a function of qcyc, fcyc and wh. The comparisons between the calculation and experimental results reveal that the present model describes the Mr of FTCFG well.
