PurposeThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has subjected a considerable strain on the healthcare (HC) systems around the world. The most affected countries are developing countries because of their weak HC infrastructure and meagre resources. Hence, building the resilience of the HC system of such countries becomes essential. Therefore, this study aims to build a resilience-based model on the HC sector of Pakistan to combat the COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses a novel hybrid approach to formulate a model based on resilient attributes (RAs) and resilient strategies (RSs). In the first step, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, i.e. full consistency method (FUCOM) is used to prioritize the RAs. Whereas, the fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) is used to rank the RSs.FindingsThe findings suggest “leadership and governance capacity” to be the topmost RA. Whereas “building the operational capacity of the management”, “resilience education” and “Strengthening laboratories and diagnostic systems” are ranked to be the top three RSs, respectively.Practical implicationsThe model developed in this study and the prioritization RAs and RSs will help build resilience in the HC sector of Pakistan. The policymakers and the government can take help from the prioritized RAs and RSs developed in this study to help make the current HC system more resilient towards the current COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country.Originality/valueA new model has been developed to present a sound mathematical model for building resilience in the HC sector consisting of FUCOM and fuzzy QFD methods. The main contribution of the paper is the presentation of a comprehensive and more robust model that will help to make the current HC system of Pakistan more resilient.
