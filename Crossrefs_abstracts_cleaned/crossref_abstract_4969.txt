Due to the recent trend of sustainability and socio-economic changes and to expand the research on resilient supply chains in Korea, this study targets Korean venture companies to ensure their success and growth. This study aims to analyze the reliance factors affecting the business performance of Korean manufacturing venture enterprises by considering two types of business performance: technology and financial performance. Regarding the factors influencing business performance, this study analyzes five resilience factors: product structure intensity, brand intensity, research and development intensity, cooperation, and corporate social responsibility. Business years were used as control variables and the causal relationship between the factors was analyzed using SPSS 22. The results show that all resilience factors positively influenced technology performance. The results for the financial performance show research and development intensity and corporate social responsibility. However, cooperation only shows different results between technology performance and financial performance. Based on these results, this study provides implications and contributions for manufacturing venture enterprises.
