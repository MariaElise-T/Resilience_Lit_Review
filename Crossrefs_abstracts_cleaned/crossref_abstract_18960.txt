Abstract
This paper proposes a local leadership model that encourages the resilience of creative entrepreneurship in rural areas. Creative entrepreneurship faces various challenges that force them to be resilient in facing the global market competition. In the creative entrepreneur community in rural areas, the role of the leader is very important in triggering the creativity and transformation of the community. A case study on the entrepreneurship community of logo designers in Kaliabu Village shows that they suffer from business discontinuity due to market competition. Learning from this case, we propose the concept of transformational creative leadership as a solution to building resilience in creative entrepreneurship. This concept combines transformational leadership and creative leadership theories which are considered capable of encouraging entrepreneurial innovation and creativity through creative processes so that creative entrepreneurial resilience can be achieved.
