A gas thrust bearing consisting of flat sector shaped pads mounted on resilient metallic cantilever beams is described and analyzed. Compliance and stiffness of the bearing assembly are discussed and the effects of bearing design parameters on performance are shown. A design example is presented and a special case where zero axial movement of the runner can be obtained is pointed out.
