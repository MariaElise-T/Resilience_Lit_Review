What is development for us humans? This question has gone through a significant change throughout different periods as our definitions have become more refined. The most recent answer is the "Human Development Index," which is based on the Capability Approach. The fallacy in this approach is that it favors the section of the world that has already had an advantage due to historical horrors committed by them, such as slavery and colonization. Unlike the Principles of Equality, the capability approach is based on treating unequals as equals, which creates a disfigured and disillusioned canvas of Human Development in the World, further leading to perverse national socio-economic goals. This paper has the principal aim of introducing the "Cope-ability Approach" as the new standard to measure the development of humankind and the creation of the Resilience Index. The Cope-ability approach is based on the aspect of resilience in humanity, taking into account the capabilities one had and what they were able to achieve with them. The idea emanates from the coping mechanisms adopted by the Global South in combating the Covid-19 outbreak with respect to the Global North. By adopting a new definition of development and the creation of the Resilience Index, developing nations will be encouraged to change their paths from one of industrialized destruction of the environment to one of a sustainable future for all of humankind.
