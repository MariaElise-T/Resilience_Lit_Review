Location-based services have become indispensable in people's life with expeditious development of technology. Location-based services(LBS) refers to the services provided by the LBS servers with regards to area and point of interest. Alternatively, the LBS means getting the right information at the right place in time. Protecting user location privacy is the most challenging factor in LBS. This survey aims to present various mechanisms in preserving the user's location privacy and proposes a mechanism for preserving the privacy of user location and query against the location injection attacks. We will be discussing credibility based k- anonymity mechanism for preserving the location of the user and homomorphic encryption for preserving the query of the user resilient location injection attacks in this paper.
