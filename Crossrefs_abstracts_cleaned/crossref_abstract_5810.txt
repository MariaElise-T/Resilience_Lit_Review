Logistic networks are complex systems, composed of many elements connected through nonlinear relations. This property makes it difficult to study these systems with traditional analytical methods. Therefore, computer simulation is a valuable tool in the practical applications of modeling the structure of the logistics network, the relationship between its components and the rules controling its functioning. The simulation model can be run in order to imitate the operation of the actual system in a given time interval and analyze its behavior under different scenarios. In the paper resilience measures for logistic networks are proposed and a multi-method approach of computer simulation for analysing their resistance is presented. The proposed concept allows determining and checking the possibilities ways of building long-term robustness of logistics networks for serious disturbances. The application of the model is illustrated by an example from the steel industry. AnyLogic 8.2 software was used for the implementation.
