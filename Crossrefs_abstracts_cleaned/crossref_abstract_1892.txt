 The current study examined the factor structure and the psychometric properties of Sandra Prince-Embury’s Resiliency Scale for Adolescents (RESA) in Chinese undergraduates. A total of 726 undergraduate students were randomly divided into two subsamples: Sample A was used for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Sample B was used for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The EFA revealed that 56 items and a model of 10 factors with 3 higher order factors (as described by Sandra) were to be retained; CFA with Sample B confirmed this result. The overall scale and the subscales of the Chinese-RESA demonstrated a high level of internal consistency. Furthermore, concurrent validity was demonstrated by the correlation of the scale with other instruments such as the PANAS and the CSS, and the predictive validity was confirmed via three multiple regression analyses using the PANAS as a criterion variable: one for the 10 subscales of the C-RESA, one for the 3 higher order scales, and one for the total C-RESA. We concluded that the C-RESA may be used for research into Chinese undergraduates’ adaptive behaviors.
