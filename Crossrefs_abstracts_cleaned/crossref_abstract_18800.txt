 Scholars suggest that only certain personality traits can easily adapt and react positively to organisational changes and consequently to innovative behaviour. Hence, in this study, we drew upon career construction theory to develop a hypothetical model examining how certain personality traits (i.e., curiosity, focus on opportunity, and resilience) are likely to influence career adaptability and consequently innovative behaviour. To test the model, we used two-wave longitudinal data focusing on 313 frontline employees operating in a random sample of five-star hotels in Dubai. Using Smart-PLS.3, we revealed that employees with a high level of curiosity, focus on opportunity, and resilience tend to increase the likelihood of their career adaptability significantly. In other words, employees with such work-related personality are more likely to adapt to organisational changes and fit different organisational environments. Furthermore, the result of the study found that career adaptability significantly mediated the relationship between these personality traits and innovative behaviour. The findings have significant implications for both theory and practice. They may also be contextual. These implications are discussed.
