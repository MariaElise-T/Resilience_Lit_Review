It is rather difficult for the stakeholders to understand and implement the resilience concept and principles in the infrastructure asset management paradigm, as it demands quality data, holistic information integration and competent data analytics capabilities to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, evaluate and predict infrastructure adaptabilities to different hazards, as well as to make damage restoration and resilience improvement strategies and plans. To meet the stakeholderâ€™s urgent needs, this paper proposes an information elicitation and analytical framework for resilient infrastructure asset management. The framework is devised by leveraging the best practices and processes of integrated infrastructure asset management and resilience management in the literature, synergizing the common elements and critical concepts of the two paradigms, ingesting the state-of-the-art interconnected infrastructure systems resilience analytical approaches, and eliciting expert judgments to iteratively improve the derived framework. To facilitate the stakeholders in implementing the framework, two use case studies are given in this paper, depicting the detailed workflow for information integration and resilience analytics in infrastructure asset management. The derived framework is expected to provide an operational basis to the quantitative resilience management of civil infrastructure assets, which could also be used to enhance community resilience.
