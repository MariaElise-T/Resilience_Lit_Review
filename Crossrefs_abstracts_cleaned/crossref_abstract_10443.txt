The aim of the study was to enhance resilience among the orphans using the Ubuntu philosophy. The study adopted the descriptive design as it allowed the participants to describe felt distress. The study population was drawn from Marange district in Manicaland province in Zimbabwe. Purposive sampling technique was used in the study. The auto biological questionnaire was used to elicit the participants’ information. The provided information included the participants’ age, sex and orphan hood status as either double or single orphaned. A sample size of 15 participants was determined by the saturation level which occurred when similar responses were repeated by the participants. Data were collected using semi- structured interview questions and content data analysis was used. The community members served as protection factors against challenges experienced by the orphans. The shared cultural philosophy of Ubuntu invigorates the sense of belonging and confidence among the orphans.
