AbstractThis article investigates the resilient and event‐triggered control problem of stochastic jump systems subject to randomly occurring denial of service (DoS) attacks and deception attacks. First, a novel resilient and memory event‐triggered scheme (RMETS) is proposed. The influence caused by DoS attacks is characterized as an uncertainty of the triggering condition. Under the RMETS, the desired security performance of the system and limited network resources can be well balanced while stochastic deception and DoS attacks occur. Second, by using the Lyapunov theory and the linear matrix inequality method, the resilient controller and the proposed RMETS are co‐designed. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure the security performance under the two types of attacks. Finally, numerical and practical examples are rendered to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.
