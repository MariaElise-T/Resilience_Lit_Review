With the rapid advancement of the urbanization process, the bridge networks in cities are becoming increasingly optimized, playing an important role in ensuring the normal operation of cities. However, with the gradual deterioration of bridges and the further attenuation of their capacity, many bridges are prone to damage or even collapse under extreme loads. After a natural disaster or human-derived accident occurs in a city, the normal operation of the bridge network in the city will play an irreplaceable role in emergency rescue and long-term recovery after the disaster. In this paper, the resilience of urban bridge networks, as a comprehensive indicator that integrates predisaster early warning, disaster response and postdisaster recovery information, is considered. This indicator has been applied in many disciplines, such as civil engineering, sociology, management and economics. The concept of resilience is expounded, and functional and resilience assessment indicators for bridge networks are established. Additionally, the research progress on bridge network resilience is described. Finally, combined with research hotspots such as big data, artificial intelligence and bridge structural health monitoring, the development trends and prospects of bridge network resilience research are discussed.
