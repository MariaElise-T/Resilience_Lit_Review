AbstractExtreme events bring great challenges to the safety and resilience of a distribution network, which makes it difficult for traditional static resources to provide enough operation support. The continuous enrichment of spatial‐temporal flexibility resources on both the power demand and supply sides provides a new idea for the dynamic dispatching of distribution network. This paper proposes a spatial‐temporal migration method of mobile power sources (MPSs) on the supply side and internet data centres (IDCs) on the demand side, based on the power‐transportation and power‐computation network coupling models respectively. Then, the dynamic dispatching potential of MPSs and IDCs is evaluated, and the dispatching models against extreme events of MPSs and IDCs are established. With the objective of maximizing system resilience and minimizing dispatching costs, an optimization model considering spatial‐temporal migration of data loads and MPSs dynamic dispatching strategy is formulated. Finally, the proposed method is tested in the modified IEEE 33‐node test system and IEEE 69‐node test system, and the economy and resilience enhancement are verified with comparison of different dispatching schemes.
