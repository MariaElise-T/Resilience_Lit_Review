Background: According to the Wagnild model, resilience as an initial trait is critical in overcoming challenges and protecting wellbeing. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties and cultural adaptation of the Persian version of the Resilience Scale (RS), including validity, reliability, and factor analysis in the adolescent population. Methods: The scale was translated and adapted using a standard method and a pilot study after receiving permission from the original author. This cross-sectional study investigated the face, content, criterion validity, construct validity, and reliability of RS. A sample of 419 adolescents aged 12 - 18 was selected by convenient sampling in Tehran, Iran. The subjects completed the RS, Beck depression inventory-II, and Mental Health Continuum Questionnaire. Results: The quantitative and qualitative analyses of scale items and modifying them based on the feedback of participants and experts showed that face and content validity was acceptable. Factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure described by Wagnild and Young, including personal competence and acceptance of self and life. Moreover, Cronbachâ€™s alpha exceeded 0.84, showing the scale has strong internal consistency. There was also a significant negative correlation between RS and the total score of the depression inventory. At the same time, there was a positive correlation between RS and the score of the mental health questionnaire, indicating acceptable criterion validity. Conclusions: Persian version of the RS can be considered a valid and reliable instrument to measure resilience in adolescent populations. Therefore, researchers and mental health professionals can use it for therapeutic, preventive, and research purposes.
