Background: The quality of elderly people’s life is one of the challenges of the 21th century. Therefore, determining factors that affect quality of life in elderly people is important. This study was designed to establish a life quality model among elderly.
Methods: In this study, a quality of life model was designed based on cognitive status and  social capital with the mediating role of resilience among older adults. For this reason, 243 subjects over 60 years old living in Tehran were chosen through convenient sampling d in 2020-2021. The specified information was collected utilizing the World Health Organization Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire to determine the quality of life, Onyx and Bullen’s social capital scale to assess the social capital, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to evaluate the cognitive impairment and Connor-Davidson resilience scale to assess the level of resilience. The obtained data were statistically analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS software v24.
Results: Results showed a significant positive relationship between cognitive status and quality of life (β=0.474, p<0.01), between social capital and quality of life (β=0.245, p<0.01), and also between resilience and quality of life (β=0.400, p<0.01) among subjects. Results also confirmed the mediating role of resilience in the relationship among cognitive status, social capital, and quality of life (β=0.102, p<0.01 & β=0.170, p<0.01).
Conclusion: For the promotion of quality of life among subjects, certain interventions must be designed by policy makers to improve social capital, cognitive status, and resilience.
