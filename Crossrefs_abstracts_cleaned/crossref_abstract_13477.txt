Objective. The study sought to explore the relationship between levels of stress and resilience with the use of the mobile phone in nursing students. Methods. Cross-sectional study conducted with 102 nursing students from several Nursing schools in India who were invited to participate in the research. The data were gathered by using the following instruments: Perceived Stress Scale(PSS) by Cohen, The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC), and Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire(MPIQ)by Walsh. Results. Most of the participants were women (94.1%), studying in the undergraduate (70.6%), with a mean age of 25.2 years. In all, 77.5% of the students had stress perception between moderate and high, 20.6% had high resilience capacity, and 25.5% were frequent mobile phone users. Perceived stress was correlated significantly and negatively with age and resilience capacity. Graduate students had greater capacity to recover than undergraduate students. Conclusion. This study indicates the negative relation of resilience capacity with stress and the use of mobile phones among nursing students. Hence, it is necessary for institutions preparing nurses to develop intervention strategies to enhance the resilience capacity, improve skills to manage stress, and healthy use of the mobile phone.Descriptors: stress, physiological; resilience, psychological; students, nursing; cell phone use; cross-sectional studies; surveys and questionnaires.How to cite this article: Sahu M, Gandhi S, Sharma MK, Marimuthu P.
