Gasket is an important sealing element of bolted flange connection structure. The nonlinear performance of the gasket material will make the flange angle and gasket compression force change. Therefore, it plays an important role in the tightness of bolted flange connection system. Apart from acknowledgment of this effect, there exists no established design calculation procedure that accounts for tightness. In this paper, the mechanical properties of the gasket at room temperature were studied, it is known that the rebound performance of the gasket is related to the initial preload. And the effect of the compressive resilience of the gasket on the tightness of the bolt flange system was discussed. The tightness of the bolt flange system can be achieved by adjusting the initial preload and working pressure of the gasket, it provides the basis for design and evaluate the tightness of bolted flange connection system.
