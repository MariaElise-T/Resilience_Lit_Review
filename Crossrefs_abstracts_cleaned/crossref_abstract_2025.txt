Front-line doctors are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19. The mental resilience of general practitioners and their areas of concerns and support required are important during this COVID-19 period. A total of 403 general practitioners attending a webinar on resiliency, hosted by the College of Family Physicians, Singapore, participated in the survey anonymously. Participants provided responses to questions relating to COVID-19 in the domains of Family and friends, Myself, Practice, and Community. Responses are categorized into LEARNING, FEAR, and GROWTH zones. The majority of the doctors reported to be in the GROWTH zone in relation to Family and friends (39%) and Myself (38%) as compared to Practice and Community, aOR = 4.5 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.9), p < 0.001. 34% of the participants reported being in the FEAR zone in relation to Family and friends, aOR = 8.0 (95% CI = 5.6 to 11.2), p < 0.001; at least 81% reported being in the LEARNING zone in relation to Practice and Community, aOR = 7.5 (95% CI = 5.8 to 9.6), p < 0.001, compared to other domains. Supporting and protecting the doctors is important in strategic planning and management of the current pandemic and building preparedness and an effective response towards future crises.
