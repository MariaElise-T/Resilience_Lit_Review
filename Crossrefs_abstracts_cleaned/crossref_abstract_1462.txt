Abstract

â€‚
During the Covid-pandemic it became clear that some groups were suffering more from the regulations against the spread of the virus than from the virus itself. To ensure social support for the regulations and to avoid increasing social economic health differences, the Dutch Association of Municipal Health Services (GGD GHOR Nederland) started a program. It was based on a plan form a group of doctors working in these health services and who worried about the health impact and wanted to strengthen the resistance against the virus and the resilience to cope with the lockdown. The aim was to build back better health on the level of society. individual Covid-patients received recovery care to gather strength - and so should public health build back a stronger and healthier society. The program consists of three parts: extensive monitoring of the impact of Covid-19, mitigating effects of the lockdown on lifestyle and mental/social wellbeing and seizing the political moment to strengthen prevention in public policy and in care. We will present examples of actions taken and their results.


Key messages
Societies need public health to recover from the impact of Covid-19, both the disease and the regulations taken to prevent spreading the virus. It is crucial to seize the moment to build back better health, both professionally to improve our services and politically to strengthen public health.
