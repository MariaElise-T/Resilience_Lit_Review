AbstractSome impediments in language learning may have a detrimental impact on learners’ actual performance on the test and lead to anxiety and demotivation. Language achievement is influenced by self-assessment (SA), academic resilience (AR), academic motivation (AM), and test-taking skills (T-TS) among other factors. Considering the relevance of these factors in language achievement, the current investigation aims to delve into the probable interactions of SA, AR, AM, T-TS, and test anxiety (TA) management among English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. A model was devised and evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to achieve this objective. This research collected 512 by distributing online questionnaires to fifteen approved private institutions which applied Telegram-based language learning. The study findings reflected that SA, AR, and AM could predict EFL learners’ T-TS. It was also confirmed that SA, AR, and AM modulated EFL learners’ TA. The implications of the study are presented and accompanied by some future research proposals as well as instructional consequences.
