Purpose Resilient denture liners are prescribed for patients who cannot adjust to hard‐based dentures because of a thin mucosa or severe alveolar ridge resorption. A nondestructive test to evaluate compliance of new soft liner materials will be useful in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a nondestructive compliance testing technique designed to characterize long‐term, silicone‐based resilient denture liner materials.Materials and Methods Samples of thicknesses of 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, and 4.4 mm of 2 materials (MPDS‐SL [Lai Laboratories, Inc, Burnsville, MN] and Molloplast‐B [Buffalo Dental, New York, NY]) were assessed for compliance using a closed‐loop servohydraulic testing system, applying a 3 lb force following a squarewave pattern; force and position values were recorded using a storage oscilloscope. The oscilloscope values were analyzed using computer software to determine compliance values. The effect of material thickness was examined by testing wedges of the 2 materials.Results The testing technique used showed that differing thicknesses had significantly different compliance values (p < .0001). In the materials used to evaluate the technique, MPDS‐SL behaved more elastically than did Molloplast‐B (p < .0001). Material thicknesses beyond 2.2 mm did not increase compliance, although MPDS‐SL had a steeper thickness‐compliance curve than Molloplast‐B.Conclusions The method used to test compliance proved to be sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between 2 materials and between varying thicknesses. The sensitivity and nondestructive nature of this test show its suitability for clinical evaluation of resilient denture liners.
