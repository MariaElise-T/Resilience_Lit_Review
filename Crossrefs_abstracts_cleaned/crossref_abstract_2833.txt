AbstractManagement of partially edentulous patients can still be a prosthodontic challenge. Replacing the missing teeth with conventional removable partial dentures (RPDs) is the traditional method for the treatment of partial edentulism; however, there are many potential disadvantages associated with traditional RPDs. With the advent of osseointegrated dental implants, possibilities of prosthetic reconstruction for partial edentulism are endless. This article discusses the implant‐retained partial overdenture (IRPOD) with resilient attachments as a predictable and cost‐effective treatment for partially edentulous patients.
