AbstractResilience is a positive psychological resource that promotes health. Trait mindfulness was found to be related to resilience. However, previous studies on this relationship have shown contradictory results. The current meta‐analysis explored the relationship between trait mindfulness and resilience based on a three‐level random‐effects meta‐analysis model. A significant and positive relationship between trait mindfulness and resilience (r = 0.385; p < 0.0001) was revealed by analyzing 197 effect sizes from 103 studies. Furthermore, the subsequent moderator analysis found that the facet of mindfulness (e.g., awareness, nonjudging) (F(6, 190) = 6.181; p < 0.001), measurement of mindfulness (e.g., the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) (F(7, 191) = 4.758; p < 0.001), aspect of resilience (e.g., family resilience) (F(5, 191) = 3.455; p < 0.05), measurement of resilience (e.g., the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale) (F(11, 185) = 2.256; p < 0.05), and age (F(1, 150) = 4.588; p < 0.05) acted as significant moderators. Overall, this study confirmed the positive relationship between trait mindfulness and resilience, suggesting that people with higher levels of trait mindfulness were more likely to have higher levels of resilience. The current findings provided insightful information for interventions targeted at improving resilience.
