Purpose: This research explores the impact of disaster resilience, social resilience, organizational resilience, and business resilience on the growth of multinational corporations (MNCs) in Australia. The research aims to investigate the influence of these resilience variables on MNC growth in Australia. 
Theoretical framework:  The theoretical framework is developed based on the concepts of disaster resilience, social resilience, business resilience, organizational resilience, and MNC growth. 
Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was used as the research instrument to collect data, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) was employed to determine the relationship between resilience variables and MNC growth in Australia.
 
Findings: The findings indicate that disaster resilience, social resilience, organizational resilience, and business resilience significantly influence the growth of MNCs in Australia. However, the impact of the epidemic was found to be the primary influencing factor, while disaster resilience and organizational resilience did not have a direct influence on MNC growth in Australia. 
Research, Practical & Social implications: The study highlights the originality and value of MNCs contributing to resilience variables by implementing risk reduction measures, supporting community preparedness and response, and investing in sustainable and resilient infrastructure. 
Originality/value: These findings provide insights for MNCs operating in Australia to enhance their resilience strategies and facilitate sustainable growth in the face of various challenges.
