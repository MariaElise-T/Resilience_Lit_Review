Because of the differences in lifestyles, livelihoods, ecological conditions, natural environment, and social environment, etc., between urban areas and rural areas, the priorities for resilience and sustainability will also be different. Due to climate change, the economy under various conditions of development and cultural changes, urban areas or urbanized villages must face issues such as sustainability maintenance and resilience adjustment will be much more sensitive and with higher uncertainties. In fact, there are similarities and differences between sustainability and resilience, therefore, the response methods adopted to deal with issues such as the natural environment and social organizations will also vary depending on factors such as urgency and time competition, sometimes the two are positively correlated, sometimes they are negatively correlated, and sometimes they may be morphologically unrelated, therefore, some innovations will be necessary to be considered, and which will also be discussed in this article. Two applications are presented for the sustainability and resilience on urban area are expressed to show the applicability and the relationships between sustainability and resilience. The twins, sustainability and resilience, may initially proceed in opposite directions (negative correlation) on the timeline of plan execution.
Two applications on “The Catchment Management with Flood Control Infrastructure” and “The COVID-19 on the Management of Sustainability and Resilience in Taiwan” are presented for the sustainability and resilience on urban area are expressed to show the applicability and the relationships between sustainability and resilience.
During the execution process, there will be a period when the two pairs develop independently, but in the end, they will proceed in the same direction (positive correlation). This is something worthy of our attention.
