Self-efficacy and perfectionism play an important role in high-performance activities. This cross-sectional study analyzes the relationship between these constructs and resilience in a sample of 145 music students (57.9% female) with a mean age of 27.77 years. Perfectionism was assessed using the Multidimensional Inventory of Perfectionism in Sport; resilience, using the Resilience Scale; and self-efficacy, using the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Females, compared to males, are more perfectionist, both on the adaptive (Cohen’s d = 0.41) and maladaptive scales (Cohen’s d = 0.70). However, no gender differences were found in self-efficacy or resilience scores. Music students categorized as highly resilient obtained significantly higher self-efficacy scores (Cohen’s d = 1.30). However, no differences were found between high- and low-resilience students in perfectionism scores, the total scale scores, or its adaptive or functional factor (striving for perfection). Differences were found for the maladaptive factor, negative reactions to imperfection, where low-resilience students scored higher on negative reactions to imperfection (Cohen’s d = 0.49). Self-efficacy shows significant predictive power for resilience (β = 0.525, p < 0.001). Although functional perfectionism did not significantly predict resilience, a marginal negative relationship was found between dysfunctional perfectionism and resilience (β = −0.156, p = 0.063). The results are discussed concerning their implications for music pedagogy and teacher intervention.
