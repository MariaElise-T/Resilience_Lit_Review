Supply chain management plays a pivotal role in the broader landscape of organizational resilience. In an era of globalization and interconnectivity, supply chains have grown increasingly complex. They extend across borders, involve multiple suppliers, and are susceptible to various risks and disruptions. Consequently, the effectiveness of supply chain management is crucial in building and maintaining an organizationâ€™s resilience (McKinsey, 2022). At the heart of this connection is the acknowledgment that a well-orchestrated supply chain can be both a source of competitive advantage and a safeguard against potential disruptions. Efficient supply chain management enables organizations to maintain uninterrupted operations, even when facing adverse conditions. This paper looks at the role of supply chain management in building supply chain resilience. The research studies previous literature, the current trends in supply chain management, and where we see the tides shifting in the future.  Keywords: Supply chain management, organizational resilience.
