Abstract
The ability of an organism or system to restore form and position elastically following a disturbance or interruption of any type is the true meaning of resilience. How often does the term “resilience” appear in regional or metropolitan contexts to allude to a local socio-economic system’s ability to rebound from a shock or disruption? Resilience can be characterized in a variety of ways. Another term is buffer capacity, which refers to a system’s ability to absorb disturbances and the quantity of disturbance before the system’s structure is altered by modifying the variables and processes that influence behavior. The study concludes that industrial activities affect the city in general and the city’s environment in particular through the pollutants caused by these activities. In order to develop planning solutions to address any change in the city under the concept of environmental resilience, the researchers paid attention to this aspect, which provides treatments, solutions, and suggestions in order to preserve the city from crises and Industrial activities that negatively affect the environment of the city, that the city of Bazian contains industrial factories for the manufacture of cement and bricks because it is rich in raw materials. Of the importance of industrial activities that contribute to the production of an economic resource for the region, but there are deficiencies in the ecological systems that maintain the direct impact of these industries on the environment, the insufficiency of regulations and legislation within the framework of industrial determinants.
