Images are the most used e-files within normal personal life utilization affecting overall community safety and security. This research focuses on grayscale images security via resilience crypto-encryption nonviolent utilization. The work relies on flexibility XOR randomizations searching for most secure image crypto scheme testing different pseudo random number generators (PRNG) aiming to select best choice for security enhancement. The experimentations assume flexibly in selecting crypto operation as well as PRNG changings depending on e-image variations. The research implements several encryption schemes adopting substitution and transposition in variance attempts. All PRNGs are tested to encrypt the grayscale images revealing attractive prioritization remarks. The paper search anticipates to recognize an overview of enhancing cryptography of grayscale images via resilience randomization flexibility. The work PRNG and crypto-operation flexibility provided best interesting privacy intellectual image security as innovative basic crypto research track to build upon.
