PurposeIn the face of information leakage, this study aims to demonstrate pathways to supply chain resilience (SCR) during information sharing by deploying organizational ethical climate (OEC) and information security culture (ISC) as non-punitive mitigation approaches.Design/methodology/approachThis empirical study was conducted to verify the framework using a questionnaire distributed to Malaysian multinational corporations (MNCs) of the manufacturing sector. The data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques with the AMOS software.FindingsThis study has confirmed the adverse impact of intentional and unintentional leakages on information sharing effectiveness. The findings showed ISC could reduce the impact of information leakage, but an OCE could not. This study provides evidence that information sharing effectiveness could impact SCR. The former is a mediator between information leakage and SCR, with information leakage moderated by information security culture. These findings convey that multinationals should set up an ISC to reduce information leakage and enhance their SCR.Originality/valuePrior studies lacked the explanation of the impact of mitigating factors on information leakage in information sharing effectiveness affecting SCR. A framework that explains the relationships add value to organizations making available strategic decisions to curb information leakage and manage SCR.
