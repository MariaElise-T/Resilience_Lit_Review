Abstract
The mathematical connections ability is the ability to link between topics in mathematics, between mathematics with other disciplines and between mathematics and life. This study discusses about designing mathematical connection skills in terms of students’ mathematical resilience involving 31 students 8th grade students as research subjects. The method used in this research is descriptive method using qualitative. The research instruments used were mathematical resilience questionnaires and essay tests. The results of this study indicate for students who have high resilience, student success in recognizing and using relationships between mathematical ideas (70.31%), students’ success in understanding the relationship of mathematical ideas (80.15%), and student success in recognizing and applying one mathematical content to another mathematical content (83.33%). Students who have moderate resilience, student success in recognizing and using relationships between mathematical ideas (48.04%), students’ success in understanding the relevance of mathematical ideas (40.28%), and student success in recognizing and applying one mathematical content to another mathematical content (40.28%). Students who have low resilience, student success in recognizing and using relationships between mathematical ideas (35.94%), student success in understanding the relationship of mathematical ideas (39.71%), and student success in recognizing and applying one mathematical content to another mathematical content (37,5%).
