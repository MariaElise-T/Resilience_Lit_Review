With the changes in global climate, adverse weather events appear to be more frequent. The efficiency, reliability, and safety of transportation operations can be compromised by extreme weather conditions. It is critical to analyse the spatiotemporal effects of extreme weather on the operational efficiency of transportation operational efficiency for meeting people’s travel and transport needs and formulating emergency management operation to prevent road congestion. It is also important to improve the resilience of transportation system. We compared the changes in transportation operational efficiency in Nanjing during normal weather on January 23 and snowstorm on January 25, 2018, using real-time travel data from Gaode Map. The results indicate that there are differences in the distribution of accessibility changes from different residential areas to the main city area in the morning peak. Overall, 90% of the accessibility change values are concentrated in −10 to 10 minutes, while 65% are concentrated in −5 to 5 minutes, and 70% of the rangeability of accessibility is concentrated in −20% to 20%. In a word, the travel in Nanjing in the snowstorm weather is basically normal. This observation is mainly due to the overnight snow removal and the reduction in the number of small car trips. In addition to the Xinjiekou area, the Hexi business district and the exit area of the cross-river tunnel should also be included in the key management areas for taking emergency management operation in the future.
