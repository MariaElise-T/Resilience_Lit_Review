The requirement for energy sustainability drives the development of integrated energy distribution systems (IEDSs). In this paper, considering the coordination of district multi-energy systems (DMESs), a hierarchical management strategy is proposed to enhance IEDS resilience. The proposed strategy is divided into three modes: the normal operation mode, the preventive operation mode and the resilient operation mode. In the normal operation mode, the objective of DEMSs is to minimize the operation costs. In the preventive operation mode, the objective of DEMSs is to maximize the stored energy for mitigating outage. The resilient operation mode consists of two stages. DMESs schedule their available resources and broadcast excess generation capacities or unserved loads to neighboring DMESs through the cyber communication network in the first stage. In the second stage, DMESs interchange electricity and natural gas with each other through the physical common bus for global optimization. A consensus algorithm was applied to determine the allocated proportions of exported or imported electricity and natural gas for each DMES in a distributed way. An IEDS including five DMESs was used as a test system. The results of the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical management strategy and algorithm.
