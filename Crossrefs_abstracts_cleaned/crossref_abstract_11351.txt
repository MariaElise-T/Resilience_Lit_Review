In June 2021, a group of renowned Colombian scholars submitted to your Journal1 an article with some reflections on the Municipal Epidemiological Resilience Index (IREM by its acronym in Spanish) proposed by the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection as a tool for decision-making in the countryâ€™s territories to boost economic reactivation and overcome the social and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to take advantage of this space to provide some analytical and interpretative insights on these reflections with the aim of enriching the discussion.
