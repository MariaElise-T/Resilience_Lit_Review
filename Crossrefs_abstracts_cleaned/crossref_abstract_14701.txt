ABSTRACT
On 20 April 2010, the 5000-foot-deep Macondo Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252) well erupted after a blowout caused a catastrophic explosion and fire aboard the BP PLC-leased Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling platform (owned by Transocean Ltd.) about 40 miles (64 km) southeast of the Louisiana coast. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf Coast oil spill now imperils ecologically sensitive lands, affects the livelihoods of thousands of workers, and threatens a way of life that has been passed down for generations. An oil spill management Decision Support System (DSS) architecture is put forth that integrates the latest advances in MCDA and geomatics engineering in order to cope with the worst environmental disaster in US history. It is shown that policy-makers should improve the sustainability and resilience of Gulf Coast ecosystems and communities so that they are healthier and more robust than before the oil spill. Policy recommendations with respect to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill are put forth. We discuss how to best assist disrupted businesses, rehabilitate polluted ecosystems, and improve regulatory oversight of the oil and gas industry in order to prevent future oil spill disasters.
