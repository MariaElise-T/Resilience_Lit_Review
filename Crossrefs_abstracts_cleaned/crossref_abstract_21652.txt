Social resilience, as part of a broader notion of resilience, is becoming increasingly relevant both in theory and practice. It is increasingly perceived as a means to cope with contemporary shocks and driving forces of change, both internal and external to the system.

It proposes qualitative resilient tools, both general and specific, for the benefit of the communities and their members, as for the people living and working in the town of LezhÃ«, Albania.
