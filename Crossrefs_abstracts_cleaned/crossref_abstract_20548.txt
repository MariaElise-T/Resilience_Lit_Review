AbstractBackgroundAymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AsymAD) subjects have an intrinsic capacity to tolerate the presence of Aβ‐plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) without developing cognitive impairment. In contrast to typical demented Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, AsymAD brains show distinct neuroinflammatory response and less accumulation of soluble pathological tau species at synaptic levels. The link between these observations and AD neuropathology is not fully understood, but increasing evidence suggests that the local plaque microenvironment plays a key role in the Aβ plaque‐associated tau pathogenesis. In this work we aim to identify the main molecular contributors of resiliency against amyloid and tau aggregation in AsymAD brains.MethodWe conducted a detailed histological and biochemical analysis using postmortem brain cortex samples from age‐matched controls (N = 21), demented AD (N = 22), and AsymAD subjects (N = 30). In fixed brain tissue, we performed the GeoMx whole spatial transcriptome atlas to compare the Aβ‐plaque microenvironment in AsymAD versus typical demented AD cases.ResultThere was no difference observed in the overall amyloid plaque burden between AsymAD and demented AD brains. However, immunofluorescence analyses indicates that AsymAD cases have the capability to form a glial barrier surrounding filamentous plaques, thereby avoiding the pathological conversion of tau. This observation is supported by biochemical analysis, which reveals that AsymAD cases have lower levels of high molecular weight tau and less seeding activity in soluble fractions. Using spatial whole transcriptomics to further characterize the plaque niche, we found an enrichment of migration signaling and autophagy in the AsymAD plaque niche, but not in AD. We are currently investigating the significance of these two molecular pathways in the Aβ plaque‐associated tau pathogenesis.ConclusionOur study provides new insights into the mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease resilience focus in the local Aβ plaque‐associated tau pathogenesis and potentials therapeutic approach to cognitive deterioration
