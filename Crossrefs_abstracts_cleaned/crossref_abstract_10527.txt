The retail sector is susceptible to unprecedented disruptions occasioned by unending sector specific turmoil and disruptions Succinctly, retail chains are not sufficiently resilient to adjust ex-ante and ex-post to disruptions The nature of retail chains; short product life cycle, razor thin profit margins and stiff competition has permeated and precipitated non-resilience to either resist, adjust or recover from both ex-post and ex-ante disruptions by the sector players pushing some firms to insolvency and liquidation However, in what is a juxtaposition of the retail chains, some sector specific players are ambidextrous to defy all turmoil and exhibit impeccable resilience This phenomenon augments the research problem that the researchers sought to explore the nexus between dynamic retail agility capability and resilience in the retail sector using Structural Equation Modelling. From the findings, the study rejected H01: There is no statistically significant relationship between SC agility capability and resilience in the Retail Sector. Conclusively, he results of this study postulate and advance the knowledge of dynamic SC Agility practices and resilience in the retail sector. It provides sufficient evidence of the facts contended herein and the nexuses thereto. Notably, the structural model was a good fit.
