Organizations, businesses, and communities at large are exposed to unprecedented adversities, uncertainties, economic, social, and ecological shocks and disruptions caused by natural disasters, climate change, political turmoil, global recession, economic instability, fluctuations in energy-source prices, war and terrorism dilemmas, pandemics, and several other newly rising social turbulences. This situation has forced stakeholders to revisit and redefine their strategies to effectively and efficiently combat adversity and uncertainty within their business domain. One concern attracting attention is organizational resilience. Strategists and decision-makers are keener to secure, sustain, and progress against unpredicted shocks by making organizations highly resilient. The present research provides in-depth insight into the foundation, evolution, progression, and dissemination of organizational resilience as a promising research field, doing so by deploying advanced bibliometric techniques on the Elsevier Scopus-listed dataset of all 484 published journal articles up to 31 December 2022. Herein, it is inferred that the concept of organizational resilience is evolving and has great potential to become a key research domain due to ever-increasing adversities around the globe.
