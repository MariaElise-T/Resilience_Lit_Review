Background
COVID-19 and the associated measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have significantly disrupted nursing education.


Purpose
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between quality of life (QoL), resilience, and associated factors among nursing students during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing requirements.


Methods
A cross-sectional study using an anonymous survey with nursing students (n = 152) was conducted at a public university in rural Appalachia in April 2020. Instruments included World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF, Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, demographics and school-related questionnaires, and an open-ended question. Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and multiple linear regression analyses.


Results
Resilience, having online experience, and being well prepared for online learning were associated with each QoL domain. Remarkably, 21% to 54% of nursing student QoL scores indicated poor QoL.


Conclusions
Cultivating resilience among nursing students may improve QoL, help with academic success, and prepare students to sustain the demands associated with the nursing profession.
