Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education institutions was particularly severe for those serving low-income students and/or students of color (BIPOC). Due to systemic inequities and intersectionality, the pandemic likely had a different impact on students depending on their identity. Purpose: This longitudinal study measured the stress of college students at a Hispanic-serving institution during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how their racial/ethnic and gender identities shaped their experience. Research Design: A survey, including a refined and validated Perceived Stress Scale, was used to measure participantsâ€™ stress, academic concerns, and pandemic concerns. Study Sample: Undergraduate students enrolled at Lehman College: n=849 in April 2020, n=701 in October 2020, and n = 686 in April 2021. Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and ANVOA were used to analyze the data, group participants, and compare stress and concerns across groups. Results: Results indicate that female-identifying BIPOC students exhibited greater resilience than other students (by race/ethnicity and gender). Conclusion: These findings support prior research highlighting the resilience of BIPOC undergraduate students.
