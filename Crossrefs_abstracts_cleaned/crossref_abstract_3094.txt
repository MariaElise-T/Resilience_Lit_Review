This study creates the high resilience nonwoven fabrics by using modified polyester fiber. In order to have resilience, the nonwoven fabrics are thermally bonded with various temperatures and the air permeability and mechanical properties of the nonwoven fabrics are then evaluated. The optimum tensile strength of 481 N and resiliency of 26 cm occur when the nonwoven fabrics are thermally bonded at 180 °C, and the optimum tear strength of 276 N occurs when the nonwoven fabrics are thermally bonded at 160 °C.
