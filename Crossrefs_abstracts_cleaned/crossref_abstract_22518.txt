Research objective: development of measures to ensure cyber resilience of SCADA and WAMS under realized threats, the consequence of which is a decrease in the quality of information required in the control of the electric power system (EPS). Research methods: probabilistic methods, methods of power system reliability analysis, Markov methods. Research result. A comparative analysis of possible states of information collection, transmission, and processing systems (SCADA, WAMS) during cyberattacks on the information and communication system was carried out. SCADA and WAMS cyber resilience models were developed. On the basis of the models proposed, measures to ensure cyber resilience of information collection, transmission, and processing system were put forward. Keywords: cyber-physical power system; resilience; information collection, processing, and transmission system; false data injection attack; DoS-attack; state estimation.
