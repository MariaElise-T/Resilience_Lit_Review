This paper explores resilience factors identified in students with disabilities at a Portuguese public university. This research employs a mixed approach using qualitative and quantitative methods. For this, we used a retrospective, multiple case study design, and individual interviews were conducted with students with disabilities. We conclude that resilience, self-esteem, family support, subjective well-being and psychological well-being are protective factors that contribute to a good adaptation and better inclusion in higher education. Accessibility conditions on campus continue to present barriers that hinder mobility and the students’ academic experience. Besides their resilience, it is noteworthy to mention the persistence and dedication these students reveal, continuing to struggle every day to make their dreams come true, facing a daily routine that is not always easy.
