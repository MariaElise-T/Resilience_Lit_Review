PurposeSupply chain resilience (SCR) has attracted much attention in the context of the high uncertainty caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), local regional conflicts and natural disasters. Based on information processing theory (IPT), this study investigates the role of supply chain information processing capability in enhancing SCR through supply chain governance (SCG), under different conditions of environmental uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachThe hypothetical model is tested by using hierarchical regression on the primary samples collected from the Chinese manufacturing industry.FindingsThe results indicate that supply chain information processing capability has a significant positive effect on SCR. Also, SCG plays a mediating role between supply chain information processing capability and SCR. Furthermore, environmental uncertainty positively moderates the effect of supply chain information acquisition and supply chain information analysis on relational governance. However, environmental uncertainty only positively moderates the effect of supply chain information analysis on contractual governance.Originality/valueThis is the first study to explain the effect of information processing capability on SCR from the supply chain perspective, while also exploring the mediating role of SCG between SCR and supply chain information processing capacity, based on IPT.
