AbstractClimate change profoundly influences plants and animals in all ecosystems including drylands such as semi-arid and arid scrublands and grasslands. At the peak of an extended megadrought in the Southwestern USA, the microclimatic refuges provided by foundation plant species and through associated vegetation were examined. Shrubs and open interstitial spaces without a canopy but with annual plants were instrumented in 2016 and the wet season of 2017 in the central drylands of California. In both years and all seasons tested, vegetation significantly mediated fine-scale near-surface air temperature and relative soil moisture contentâ€”defined here as microclimate. The foundation species with other vegetation provided the most significant thermal refuge potential capacity for other plants and animals, but there was variation by growing season. Soil moisture content was frequently increased by the direct canopy effects of shrubs. This evidence suggests that the climate many plants and animals experience, even during an extended megadrought, is mediated by the local plants in highly impacted drylands with anthropogenic disturbance and significant water-induced challenges. Foundation species such as shrubs in drylands function as a potent starting point in examining the ecological relevance of climate at scales germane to many species locally. An ecological framework for climate resilience using shrubs will improve conservation and restoration planning in drylands.
