This paper investigated the relationships amongwork-family conflict, well-being, burnout and resilience for preschool teachers in Chinese preschools. We adopt Work-family Conflict Scale, Burnout Scale, Brief Resilience Scale and Well-being Scale. A total of 42412 preschool teachers were recruited to participate in this study and completed self-report of work-family conflict, well-being, burnout and resilience. Correlation analysis showed that work-family conflict, burnout and resilience could predict well-being. Besides, we built the structural equation model and carried out the mediation analysis to further study the mediating effects of burnout and resilience. This study found out new variables that would mediate the relationship between work-family conflict and well-being, which could be taken into consideration for future teaching practices.
