Abstract

Introduction:
Owing to daily exposure to high job stress, nurses need to use coping techniques. One of the coping strategies helping a person to cope with stressful situations effectively is resiliency skills. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the factors related to nurses’ resiliency during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.


Methods:
The resiliency of 288 nurses, 145 nurses from the COVID-19 wards , and 143 nurses from other wards were compared using 25-item Connor & Davidson Resilience Questionnaire. This study was conducted in 2021 in four referral hospitals at Shiraz.


Results:
The mean age of participants was 32 y. The average resilience score in the in the participants worked in COVID-19 wards was 95.30 for men and 87.72 for women, and in the non-COVID-19 wards was 85.82 for men and 88.48 for women. The mean resiliency scores of nurses working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards did not show a statistically significant difference. Factors affecting resilience included age, employment status, gender, and job expectancy.


Conclusions:
In this study, the resiliency of nurses working in COVID-19 wards did not differed from that of working in non-COVID-19 ones. This result should be further investigated and elaborated. Health policymakers should consider job expectation, gender, age, and employment status of nurses when making plans for future pandemics.
