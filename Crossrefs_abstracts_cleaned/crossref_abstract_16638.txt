As China transitions from high-speed to high-quality economic development, the concept of sustainable development, particularly environmental, social, and governance (ESG), has emerged as a crucial consideration in corporate decision-making. This study examines the relationship between ESG performance and corporate resilience through the lens of capital allocation efficiency. Employing a fixed-effects model, heterogeneity analysis, and a mediation effect model, we analyzed 4436 A-share listed companies that were rated according to ESG standards by the China Securities Index (CSI) between 2011 and 2021. Our findings suggest that: (1) ESG performance positively impacts corporate resilience. (2) The magnitude of this effect varies based on the ownership structure and industry. Specifically, ESG performance has a more significant influence on non-state-owned companies and manufacturing companies. (3) Improving ESG performance can enhance corporate resilience through three mechanisms: reducing financing costs, improving investment efficiency, and improving operational efficiency.
