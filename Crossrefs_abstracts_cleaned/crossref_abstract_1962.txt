Abstract
The rise in population has affected the environmental quality and liveability of urban areas. This brings in new challenges to address the resilience capacity of the cities. The multifunctionality of urban areas are considered to be one of the strategies to build urban resilience. The paper explores the development of multifunctional landscapes from a neighbourhood planning perspective. For this, it considers open spaces within a neighbourhood as an element which can be conserved and transformed to productive spaces where waste generated within a neighbourhood is treated and used for developing green spaces. Besides, the system provides an opportunity to transform such land parcels within the city into productive spaces thereby integrating solid waste management and landscape development sustainably. The proposed concept discusses the social, economic and environmental benefits of implementing such spaces which are inevitable in the pursuit of wellbeing and quality of life of the people in a resilient city. At a broader level, the system proposed contributes in making green spaces in any neighbourhood and in the long run, this concept should find its place in urban planning policies of similar city contexts to ensure that our cities, its system of waste management and their landscapes remain sustainable.
