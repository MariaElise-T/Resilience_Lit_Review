Abstract
Background
In this study, we examined psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (RS) and parenting-related factors associated with resilience among disaster-exposed adolescents.

Methods
Eighteen months after the earthquake, a total of 1266 adolescents (43.4% male, mean age = 15.98; SD = 1.28) were assessed using the RS, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale, the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and Parental Bonding Instrument.

Results
Through exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) and parallel analysis, responses were characterized into a 3-factor structure: personal competence, meaningfulness, and acceptance of self and life. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the RS was 0.89 and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.72. In terms of predictive validity, resilience was found to be a significant predictor for PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Multiple regression analysis showed that maternal parenting styles were significant predictors of resilience after adjusting for gender, age, sibling number, and earthquake experiences.

Conclusions
The Chinese version of RS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing resilience among adolescent survivors after disasters. The implications for research and resilience-oriented interventions were also discussed.
