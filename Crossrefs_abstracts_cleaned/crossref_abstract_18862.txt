To date, research delving into the narratives of persons living with dementia is limited. Taking part in usual mealtime activities such as preparing food can sustain the identity of persons living with dementia. Yet if capacity for mealtime activities changes, this can put a strain or demand on the family, which must adjust and adapt to these changes. The aim of this study was to develop an in‚Äêdepth story of resilience in one family living with dementia that was experiencing mealtime changes. Thematic narrative analysis following the elements of Clandinin and Connelly's (2000) 3D narrative inquiry space was used. One family's dementia journey was highlighted using the metaphor of a baking recipe to reflect their story of resilience. Developing positive strategies and continuing to learn and adapt were the two approaches used by this resilient family. Reminiscing, incorporating humour, having hope and optimism, and establishing social support were specific strategies. This family continued to learn and adapt by focusing on their positive gains and personal growth, accumulating life experiences, and balancing past pleasures while adapting to the new normal. Future work needs to further conceptualise resilience and how it can be supported in families living with dementia.
