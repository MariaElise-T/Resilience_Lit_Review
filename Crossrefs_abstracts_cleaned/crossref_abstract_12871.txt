The primary data of this study came from interviews with thirteen informants, consisting of six couples getting married, three Ungku Kali people, and four local people. After collecting the data, they were classified according to the existing themes and analyzed with the resilience theory. The study results found that Ungku Kali's position in Kurai Taji is as a trustee in the religious field or a respected Nagari cleric in society. As for the Ungku Kali practice using the facilities of the Surau Korong Lubuk Ipuh as a place of practice assisted by Apak Labai as the marbot at the Surau Korong Lubuk Ipuh, all the requirements are conveyed by this Apak Labai.
