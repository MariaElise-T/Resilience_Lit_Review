Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been widely considered an attractive security primitive. They use the deviations in the fabrication process to have unique responses from each device. Due to their nature, they serve as a DNA-like identity of the device. But PUFs have also been targeted for attacks. It has been proven that machine learning (ML) can be used to effectively model a PUF design and predict its behavior, leading to leakage of the internal secrets.
To combat such attacks, several designs have been proposed to make it harder to model PUFs. One design direction is to use Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) as the building block of the PUF. NVM typically are multi-level cells, i.e, they have several internal states, which makes it harder to model them. However, the current state of the art of NVM-based PUFs is limited to ‘weak PUFs’, i.e., the number of outputs grows only linearly with the number of inputs, which limits the number of possible secret values that can be stored using the PUF. To overcome this limitation, in this work we design the Arbiter Non-Volatile PUF (ANV-PUF) that is exponential in the number of inputs and that is resilient against ML-based modeling. The concept is based on the famous delay-based Arbiter PUF (which is not resilient against modeling attacks) while using NVM as a building block instead of switches. Hence, we replace the switch delays (which are easy to model via ML) with the multi-level property of NVM (which is hard to model via ML). Consequently, our design has the exponential output characteristics of the Arbiter PUF and the resilience against attacks from the NVM-based PUFs. Our results show that the resilience to ML modeling, uniqueness, and uniformity are all in the ideal range of 50%. Thus, in contrast to the state-of-the-art, ANV-PUF is able to be resilient to attacks, while having an exponential number of outputs.
