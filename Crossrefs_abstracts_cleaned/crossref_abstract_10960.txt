AbstractThis study examines the association between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and two psychological attributes, resilience and optimism, in first‐time mothers, after controlling for demographic and motherhood‐related characteristics. PTG, the self‐examination triggered by life‐changing events, contains five factors: (1) relating to others, (2) new possibilities, (3) personal strength, (4) spiritual change, and (5) appreciation of life. Outcomes from studies conflict on whether PTG is associated with the two psychological attributes of resilience (the ability to resume one's life after adversity) and optimism (viewing life in a positive light). This study used a cross‐sectional design. A convenience sample of first‐time mothers whose infants were between 3 months and 1 year (N = 415) completed questionnaires containing several standardized and reliable instruments including those measuring the independent variables of resilience and optimism, and the dependent variable of PTG. A STROBE checklist guided the reporting of this study. Resilience was associated with overall PTG and four of its five factors. Optimism also was associated with overall PTG but only associated with two of its five factors. PTG profiles and squared semipartial correlations indicated that resilience had the stronger association, compared to optimism, with PTG and most of its factors. Our study's findings on the strong link between resilience and PTG suggest the need for research examining the impact of specific psychosocial nursing activities (e.g., providing emotional support; assisting others to identify their own strengths; encouraging the mobilization of one's internal resources; furnishing needed resources and referrals; and supplying health education and information), as these activities may not only promote resilience but also may contribute to PTG.
