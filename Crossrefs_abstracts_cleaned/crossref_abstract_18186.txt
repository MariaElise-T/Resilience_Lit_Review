This study, it was aimed to examine the relationship between resilience, self-compassion, and attachment styles. The study group consists of a total of 1026 married individuals, 574 females (55.9%) and 452 males (44.1%) aged 18 and above. As data collecting tools, “Brief Resilience Scale”, “The Self Compassion Scale” and “Attachment Styles Scale in Interpersonal Relationships” were used. In the study, the relationships between resilience and self-compassion, and attachment styles were examined by correlation and regression analysis. As a result of the correlation analysis, a significant relationship has been found between resilience and self-compassion, secure attachment, anxious attachment, and avoidant attachment. From the result of the analysis, it has been determined that the resilience levels of the married individuals were significantly predicted by self-compassion, secure attachment, and anxious attachment variables, while it has been not predicted by avoidant attachment variables. The findings obtained have been discussed in the context of the literature.
