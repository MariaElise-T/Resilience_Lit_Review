AbstractIn recent years, extreme weather events, such as typhoons, have led to large‐scale power outages in distribution systems. As a result, developing strategies to bolster distribution system resilience has become imperative. This paper proposes a two‐stage stochastic programming model aimed at enhancing this resilience. Prior to a typhoon, the first stage establishes a comprehensive wind field model based on extreme value distribution for accurate wind speed predictions. Simultaneously, a refined stress–strength interference model is used to determine the likelihood of distribution line failures. Taking into account the uncertainty of line damage, repair crews and mobile emergency generators are then strategically positioned at staging depots. Following the typhoon, the second stage coordinates network reconfiguration, dispatches repair crews, and mobilizes mobile emergency generators to minimize load shedding and expedite repairs. This model was validated on the IEEE 33‐bus distribution system, coupled with a corresponding transportation network, utilizing data from the 2018 super typhoon Mangkhut'' in China. Simulations indicate that our approach can effectively reduce load shedding and power outage durations, thereby enhancing the resilience of distribution systems.
