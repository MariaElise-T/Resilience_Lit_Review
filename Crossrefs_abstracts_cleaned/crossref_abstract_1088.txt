Given the current unstable worldwide conditions, school is considered an essential component for the empowerment of students’ life skills, the construction of harmonious relationships with peers and their transformation through adulthood, so that they can be ready to undertake the role of active citizen in society. This paper attempts to describe a collaborative project concerning three research areas as three separate studies: resiliency, peer mediation and citizenship education. The project consists of teaching interventions which were orchestrated for the infusion of the above components in the school curriculum aiming at students’ emotional and conflict resolution skills as well as the promotion of their democratic role. Students of primary and secondary education from preadolescence to the culmination of adolescence participated in the project. Research findings suggest that school should focus on factors relating to students’ emotional and social development which may successfully set the stage for improved academic performance and a responsible, democratic role towards society. These objectives are aligned with the principles of Critical Pedagogy focusing on students’ emancipation, the acquisition of a values set and their readiness to act in the direction of common good equipped with critical thinking skills, empathy, and respect towards divergence.
