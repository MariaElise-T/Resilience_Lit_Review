In order to monitor the level of community resilience and the quality of the living environment under public health emergencies, 13 communities in Xingfu Street, Dujiangyan City are taken as the empirical research objects, and the PSR model-entropy method is used to construct a community-based public health emergency prevention and control resilience assessment model to explore the existing problems of the community’s epidemic prevention capabilities and the quality of the human settlement environment. The results show that: ①The resilience level and the quality of the living environment of the series of communities under Xingfu Street are generally average, and there are big differences in resilience between communities. ②In the construction indicators, “Total per capita income loss” and “Proportion of population over 65” have significant negative impact, “Application level of new prevention and control technology”, “Number of community medical staff”, “Proportion of medical staff with intermediate and above titles”, “ Exchangeability and sharing of health information resources” and “Number of hospital beds” have significant positive impact. ③The resilience of the prevention and control of public health emergencies in the community is most significantly affected by medical resources, but the community medical resources are generally scarce and the development is not coordinated. Xingfu Street series communities should focus on improving the level of basic medical services, promote resilience building in stages, and realize the organic combination of dynamic epidemic prevention and sustainable development.
