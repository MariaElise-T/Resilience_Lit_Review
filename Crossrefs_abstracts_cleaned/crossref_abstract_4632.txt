Creating a safe and resilient urban environment is a crucial part of sustainable urban development. Therefore, it is imperative that a cityâ€™s safety resilience is evaluated from various perspectives. To evaluate and improve the resilience of urban fire safety more scientifically, this study proposes a theoretical framework for evaluating urban safety resilience based on the triangle model and an index system including fire hazard, regional characteristics, and fire resilience is established. The entropy weight method and cloud model are used for quantitative evaluation, and the weights and risk level ratings are analyzed and discussed. The results demonstrate that the method considering urban safety resilience plays a significant role in promoting the development of urban fire safety and can provide a reference for policymakers in improving fire services.
