Significance
Networks provide useful models for many natural and manmade phenomena, such as transportation, financial, and social–ecological systems. This paper addresses network motifs as a mechanism for understanding resilience of such networks. The significance of this work can be viewed through an important example—namely, power-grid networks, constituting a core component of modern critical infrastructures. While most existing approaches focus on the analysis of global network characteristics, recent studies suggest that resilience of power grids may also be intrinsically connected to higher-order geometric features such as network motifs. Here, a systematic data-driven approach is developed that sheds light on the role of local topology and geometry in vulnerability of power grids and other complex networks.
