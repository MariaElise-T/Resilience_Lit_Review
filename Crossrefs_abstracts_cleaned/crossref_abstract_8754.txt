The paper examines the connection between resilience, self-handicapping and social media addiction, as well as predictive and classification values of such a model with these three variables of interests in logistic regression analysis. The research sample consisted of 258  undergraduate and postgraduate students at the Faculty of Education in Jagodina. The follow- ing main results were obtained: the correlation between social media dependence and resilience  is negative and higher than the correlation with self-handicapping, but in the regression model self-handicapping shows a better predictive value for the criterion variable of addiction than resilience. On the basis of self-handicapping, addiction to the influence of social media can be better predicted than on the basis of resilience. Self-handicapping is a better predictor of addiction to the influence of social networks than resilience. The obtained results can serve as recommendations for a broader and systematic consideration of the resilience of future teachers in the educational and media context in the conditions of crisis and new pandemic circumstances.
