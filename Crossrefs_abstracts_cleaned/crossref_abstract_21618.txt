Objectives  The purpose of this study is to identify differences and correlations between variables such as em-pathy capacity, resilience, self-compassion, and patient-centered nursing according to the general character-istics of clinical nurses.
Methods  A structured questionnaire was distributed to 230 clinical nurses working in three secondary medical in-stitutions with more than 250 beds in U City, and 218 copies of the data were used in the final analysis. This is a descriptive correlation study. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Scheffé post hoc test, Person’s correlation analysis, and tool reliability using the SPSS 25.0 program.
Results  There was a significant difference in empathy capacity according to general characteristics depending on age, and the age was higher in those aged 50 or older than in those aged 30 to 39 (F=3.81, P<.01). There was a significant difference in resilience depending on age, and it was higher in those aged 50 or older than those aged 29 or younger, 30 to 39, or 40 to 49 (F=7.25, P<.001). There was a statistically significant difference in pa-tient-centered nursing depending on the age, position, and work department of the study subject, with the age range being higher in those aged 50 or older than those aged 29 or younger, 30 to 39, or 40 to 49 (F=7.25). , P<.001), the head nurse was higher than the charge nurse (F=6.18, P<.01), and the working department was high-er in the general ward and intensive care unit than the operating room and anesthesiology department (F=4.76, P). <.001). Looking at the correlation results, resilience is empathy competency (r=.551, p<.01), patient-centered nursing is empathy competency (r=.637, p<.01), and resilience (r=.602, p<.01). .01), self-compassion showed a statistically significant positive correlation with empathy (r=.306, p<.01), resilience (r=.508, p<.01), and It showed a statistically significant positive correlation with patient-centered nursing (r=.269, p<.01).
Conclusions  Clinical nurses' empathy capacity, resilience, and self-compassion show a positive correlation with patient-centered nursing, so the development and application of programs to improve clinical nurses' resilience and self-compassion and to improve empathy are important in improving the quality of nursing services.
