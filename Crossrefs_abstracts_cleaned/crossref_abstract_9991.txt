Abstract
Critical infrastructures are the backbone of our societies with increasingly complex and networked characteristics and high availability demands. This makes them vulnerable to a wide range of threats that can lead to major incidents. Resilience is a concept that describes a system’s ability to absorb and respond to disturbances, as well as to learn from the past and anticipate new threats.
In this article, we apply the Digital Twin concept to the infrastructure domain to improve the system’s resilience capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis related to infrastructure characteristics, crisis management and resilience measures. As a result, we propose a Digital Twin Conceptual Framework for critical infrastructures. We conclude that the Digital Twin paradigm is well suited to enhance critical infrastructure resilience.
