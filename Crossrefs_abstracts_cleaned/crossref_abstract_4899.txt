The increasing frequency of natural disasters in refugee camps has highlighted the urgent need for a dependable power source. In humanitarian camps, a reliable power supply is essential for meeting the basic daily needs of the residents. However, the conventional power systems in these camps often experience interruptions. To address this issue, microgrids have emerged as a viable solution. Although several studies have recognized the resilience benefits of microgrids, their application in refugee camps has been relatively limited. Hence, this study presents a grid-tied microgrid that combines photovoltaic and battery systems, designed using REopt lite web version software, to fulfill the energy requirements of Rohingya refugees in a selected camp located in Ukhia, Coxâ€™s Bazar. Additionally, this study introduces four new indicators of resilience to evaluate the performance of the designed system. The findings reveal that the proposed microgrid consists of 5685 kW of photovoltaic capacity and 9011 kWh of battery capacity, enabling it to handle a 15 h power outage and resulting in substantial life-cycle savings of USD 2,956,737. The payback period for this resilient system is calculated to be 6.37 years, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 12.2%. Furthermore, the system emits fewer emissions compared to other analysed modes in resilient operation, emphasizing its sustainability. In conclusion, the designed microgrid successfully enhances the reliability of the power supply in refugee camps.
