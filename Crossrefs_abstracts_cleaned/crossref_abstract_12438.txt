Lean Manufacturing is always important for process improvement in manufacturing industries especially in deem of adoption but the implementation of simple lean is not enough to attain required results. A recent trend has been observed regarding the implementation of strategies like Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green (LARG) in combination to attain fruitful results. However, this combination carries a complication regarding its understanding and implementation and a gap observed regarding the availability of literature study that can cope all these strategies on one platform for understanding and can suggest a proper implementation method. It has been observed that there are some new models that are utilizing electronic configurations to provide powerful platform for process improvements. Utilization of LARG as tool or technique in combination of technologies can be very effective for process improvements. Therefore, this current work emphasis on the combining of LARG along with wireless technologies for obtaining a sustainable improvement in manufacturing sector, which seems unavailable. Based on this ideology, the aim of this research is to conduct a systematic literature study that reviews the previously available LARG research with the objectives to first study the LARG combination for understanding and to develop the interrelation between LARG and previous available technologies for its successful implementation. The literature study results that the LARG combination has many benefits like helpful to attain elimination of non-value activities (lean), responsive to the changing demands of customers as per increasing volatile market (agile), responsive to the unexpected disruptions (resilient) and to adopt environmental protection (green) but typically lacks its utilization with modern technologies (Like RFID) that will be helpful to attain successful implementation. The contribution of this study is the next generation in LARG implementation to emphasis more on the combining of LARG implementation with utilization of modern technologies
