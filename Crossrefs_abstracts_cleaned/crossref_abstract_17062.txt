Abstract

Objectives
Studies on quality of life (QoL) and academic resilience among nursing students during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic remain underreported. This study investigated the relationship between nursing students’ QoL and academic resilience and their predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Methods
A descriptive survey, cross-sectional study that used two self-reported questionnaire scales to evaluate the QoL and academic resilience of Filipino nursing students (n=924). Chi-squared test and multiple regression were used to analyze the data.


Results
There was no significant association between the QoL and academic resilience to participants’ profile variables. Gender and year level of nursing students were significant predictors of QoL and academic resilience.


Conclusions
Our study concludes that a better understanding of the QoL and academic resilience, which are two distinct concepts critical in developing a student’s mental well-being, will help stakeholders in nursing education establish effective psychoeducation programs for nursing students.
