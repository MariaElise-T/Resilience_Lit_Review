Abstract
This study reports on the results of an online survey of direct support professionals (DSPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in June 2020 to measure their perceived quality of life, stressors, coping/resilience skills, and knowledge of health care rights directly related to the pandemic for the persons that they support. Specifically, we examined direct support workers' perceptions of their quality of life, levels of stress, and their self-reported resilience skills. We found that perceived stress was strongly correlated with both self-reported quality of life and resilience, but not with years of DSP experience. Moreover, while DSPs overwhelmingly knew and affirmed health care rights for people with disabilities, they were less knowledgeable about their legal rights during hospital stays.
