PurposeMost of the extant literature on resilience builds on normative, conceptual or silo approaches, thereby lacking an integrative approach to cold chain logistics risks (CCLRs) and resilience. The purpose of this paper is to bridge the current research gap by developing a model, based on broad empirical evidence, of the interplay between CCLRs, resilience and firm performance (FP) in perishable product supply chains (PPSCs).Design/methodology/approachA mixed method approach is used with qualitative data from interviews and quantitative data from a survey across the supply chain. The analysis is framed by contingency theory and resource-based theory.FindingsFour significant sources of CCLRs and six resources used to build resilience are identified. Then, supply chain resilience (SCR) as a moderator of the negative relationship between CCLRs and FP is corroborated.Practical implicationsThe findings will help improve managerial understandings of critical sources of risks in cold chain logistics and resources indispensable to build resilience. The scope of the research is cold chain logistics for PPSCs, which has relevance to other cold supply chains as well.Originality/valueWhile some theoretical frameworks suggest resilience being a moderator in the negative relationship between cold chain risks and a firmâ€™s performance, this study empirically tests this relationship using the survey across the entire supply chain. A new empirically and theoretically driven definition of SCR is also developed.
