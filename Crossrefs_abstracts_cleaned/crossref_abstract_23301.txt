 The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of psychological flexibility in mediating the beneficial effects of resilience on distress and quality of life (QoL) in people with MS (PwMS). The psychological flexibility framework underpinning acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) was used to conceptualise psychological flexibility. A total of 56 PwMS completed an online survey that assessed global psychological flexibility and each of its six core sub-processes, resilience, distress, mental and physical health QoL, socio-demographics, and illness variables. Mediation analyses showed that, as hypothesised, higher levels of global psychological flexibility and its sub-processes were associated with increases in the positive impacts of resilience on distress and mental and physical health QoL via a mediational mechanism. These findings suggest that psychological flexibility skills build resilience capacities in PwMS. The psychological flexibility framework offers an ACT-based intervention pathway to build resilience and enhance mental health and QoL in PwMS.
