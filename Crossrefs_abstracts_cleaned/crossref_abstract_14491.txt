The article shows the results of an empirical research of the social frustration, resilience and psychological security of internal affairs officers. We suppose that officers with low or high levels of social frustration differ in the values of psychological security of their personalities and their resilience. The study results showed differences in social frustration in groups of subjects with high and low levels of psychological security of personality. Correlation analysis revealed reliable negative relationship between the social frustration, resilience and fundamental convictions of the officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On the whole, one can conclude that officers with high levels of psychological security of personality are notable for lowered social frustration and increased resilience. Therefore, an increased level of social frustration can lower the resilience and pose a threat to the psychological security of personality of internal affairs officers.
