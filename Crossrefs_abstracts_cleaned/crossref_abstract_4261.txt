Ubiquitous Surveillance refers to the unilateral collection of data on people through sensors (Oulasvirta et al., 2012). It is a phenomenon under-explored and under-practised within the design discipline. The proposed work1 explores the resilience to surveillance by framing it from the design perspective. It starts with a literature review to outline the Age of Surveillance and analyses approaches and tools to address such complex and controversial topics, focusing on design for Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff, 2018). Finally, the article outlines the principles and values of Surveillance Resilience Design.
