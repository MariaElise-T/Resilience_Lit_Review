Background and Purpose: Resilience is an essential element of life satisfaction. Individuals with high resilience are normally able to cope with a problem and find its solutions. Resilience is critical in helping students to achieve life satisfaction and good mental health. In addition, social support has been found as one of the good predictors in achieving life satisfaction. However, the underlying mechanism by which resilience is associated with life satisfaction has been under examined. The current study investigates the association between resilience and life satisfaction among Malaysian college students, focusing on social support as a factor mediating this association.
 
Methodology: A total of 491 students participated in this study. The data were collected using a set of questionnaires. The mediation model was tested using structural equational modelling.
 
Findings: Results showed that the total effects of resilience on life satisfaction were significant. Furthermore, social support mediated the influence of resilience on life satisfaction. Therefore, improving resilience and enhancing social support may increase Malaysian college students’ satisfaction in life.
 
Contributions: The present study has implications on enhancing life satisfaction among college students. Finally, the study highlights the importance of social support in the implementation of intervention programmes with the goal of enhancing life satisfaction.
