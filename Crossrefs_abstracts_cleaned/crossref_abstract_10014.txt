 Family caregiving is increasing steadily as our overall population ages. Most research has studied caregivers in relation to stress level, anxiety, and depression. This study investigated the relationship between stress level, learning style, resilience factors, and ways of coping in 76 participants from 11 support groups of the Alzheimer Association of Eastern Massachusetts. The findings of the study show gender differences on burden and learning style, moderately high caregiver resilience, use of both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and moderate correlations between levels of resilience and specific use of coping strategies. Both future research directions and the implications of these findings for caregiver support groups are discussed.
