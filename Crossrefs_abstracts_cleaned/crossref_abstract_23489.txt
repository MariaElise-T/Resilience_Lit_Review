 Abstract Measuring organizational safety performance is critical in managing production systems. This practice allows decisions to be made objectively and based on data analysis. In the study of resilience engineering applied to the safety of production systems, there is interest on the part of the scientific community and companies in identifying, in the different processes of organizations, indicators to measure resilient performance in safety management. This study aims to discuss and analyze qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the potential for resilience in safety management and support new research on resilience engineering applied to safety performance management in industries with high technological risks. The methodology used included a systematic review of national and international literature from the last ten years. The results obtained provide a critical analysis of the methods used to define safety indicators applied through resilience engineering to occupational safety management in organizations that deal with high technological risks. Qualitative methods for generating safety indicators from the perspective of Resilience Engineering have proven to be a better way, as they apply the concepts of Safety I and Safety II and early warning indicators.
