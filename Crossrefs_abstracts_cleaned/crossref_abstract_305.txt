<B>Background</B><br />
The aim of this paper is to describe the results of a study concerning the relationship between resiliency and appraisal of a stressful situation, anxiety reactions and undertaken methods of coping among sportsmen.<br />
<br />
<B>Participants and procedure</B><br />
The research concerned 192 competitors who actively train in one of the Olympic disciplines â€“ individual or team. We used the following instruments: Resiliency Assessment Scale (SPP-25); Stress Appraisal Questionnaire A/B; Reactions to Competition Questionnaire; Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS); Sport Stress Coping Strategies Questionnaire (SR3S, self-constructed).<br />
<br />
<B>Results</B><br />
Athletes most frequently apply positive types of stress appraisal, and they cope with stress through a task-oriented style during competitions. There is a relationship between the level of resiliency and the analysed aspects of the process of stress. The higher the resiliency, the more positive is the appraisal of a stressful situation and the more task-oriented are the strategies applied. Similarly, in everyday situations resilient sportspeople positively appraise difficult situations and undertake mostly task-oriented strategies. Resiliency is connected with less frequently experiencing reactions in the form of anxiety.<br />
<br />
<B>Conclusions</B><br />
The obtained results, similarly to previous research, suggest that resiliency is connected with experiencing positive emotions. It causes more frequent appraisal of stressful situations as a challenge. More resilient people also choose more effective and situation-appropriate coping strategies. Therefore they are more resistant to stress.
