The key objective of this research was to establish an evidence-based study about current teaching practices; focusing on the key elements of teaching methods used in pre-service education programs that can build resilience against (violent) extremism. One of the principles underpinning training young teachers is to help prepare and equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to practice peace education. The qualitative data was collected from teachers engaged in the education programs. In total 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Wah Cantonment, and six major cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, Pakistan.  The study argues that in order to ensure resilient teachers and trainers, the Bachelors of Education degree (B.Ed) program needs to offer both specialist skills and a theoretical understanding of peace, civic, and tolerance education. Such a result-orientated focus can enhance the effectiveness of the existing education programs in Pakistan vis-à-vis resilience towards (violent) extremism.
