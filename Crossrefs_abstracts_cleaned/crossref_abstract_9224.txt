This study investigated the effect of perceived entrepreneurial stress on entrepreneurial resilience with the well-being of an individual entrepreneur in mediating role and perceived online social support moderating this relationship. Using survey data collected from 204 entrepreneurs in two major towns in Kenya, considered entrepreneurial hubs were analyzed. To uncover this relationship, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test the discriminant validity of the measurement model. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test four hypotheses in seven models to estimate direct, indirect and interaction effects. The results showed that perceived entrepreneurial stress and the well-being of individual entrepreneurs are significantly negatively related; this study also found out that the well-being of individual entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial resilience are positively related. For moderation effect, perceived online social support positively moderated the relationship between the well-being of individual entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial resilience. Finally, to test the indirect effect, bootstrapping analysis was used to identify mediation effects. The bootstrapping indirect test results revealed that the well-being of individual entrepreneurs mediates the relationship between perceived entrepreneurial stress and entrepreneurial resilience. This study outlines online communities as an avenue where entrepreneurs can access online social support that can facilitate entrepreneurial resilience during crises and to foster resilience among entrepreneurs despite adversity, entrepreneurs need to consider making a culture of seeking and providing social support online to fellow entrepreneurs and online communities.
