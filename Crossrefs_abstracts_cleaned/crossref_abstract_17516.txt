Introduction Resilience and quality of life (QOL) can involve a positive approach in group interventions for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study aims to evaluate resilience and family QOL at the start of a psychoeducational group. Methods Cross-sectional assessment of resilience and family QOL used the Family Quality of Life Scale (ECVF) and 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14). Results The study group showed high levels of resilience. Parents considered the resources/support domain crucial, although satisfaction in this area was comparatively lower. Concerns about low satisfaction with available resources and support were notable. Gender differences were observed but not statistically significant. Discussion The studyâ€™s findings support prior research on parental resilience in families of children with ASD. The literature on the QOL for these families presents mixed findings. The importance of parental involvement in service planning is highlighted. Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of resilience in parents of children with ASD, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. The findings underscore the need to address the perceived low quality of available resources and support. Further investigation is needed.
