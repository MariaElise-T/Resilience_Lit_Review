AbstractThis study aimed to implement and evaluate a work‐based personal resilience enhancement intervention for forensic nurses. A mixed methods design consisting of surveys, interviews, and a case study approach, whereby the experiences of a group of nurses were studied in relation to their experiences of an intervention programme to enhance personal resilience, was utilized. Nurses working on forensic inpatient wards were invited to participate. Senior nurses were recruited as mentors. Data were collected via pre‐ and post‐programme surveys to evaluate nurses' levels of resilience. Post‐programme interviews were undertaken with nurses and mentors to explore their experiences of the programme. Descriptive statistics of survey data examined changes in nurses' resilience levels pre‐ and post‐intervention. Free‐text survey data and interview data were analysed thematically. The SQUIRE 2.0 checklist was adhered to. Twenty‐nine nurses participated. Levels of personal resilience (M = 4.12, SD = 0.60) were significantly higher post‐programme than pre‐programme (M = 3.42, SD = 0.70), (t49 = 3.80, P = 0.000, 95% CI = 0.32, 1.07). Nurses felt the programme had a marked impact on their personal resilience, self‐awareness, confidence, and professional relationships. The benefits of the programme demonstrate the advantages of providing a nurturing environment for nurses to consolidate their resilience levels. Findings demonstrated that resilience enhancement programmes can increase nurses' levels of resilience and confidence and improve inter‐professional relationships. Our findings are important for clinicians, nurse managers, and policymakers considering strategies for improving the workplace environment for nurses. The long‐term impact of resilience programmes may improve nurse retention and recruitment.
