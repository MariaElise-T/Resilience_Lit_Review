The Resilience Scale (RS) was developed by Wagnild and Young (1993) to measure a personality characteristic or coping resource that facilitates adaptation. The RS, however, has not been evaluated with foreign-born populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report the factor structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of a Russian language version of the RS in a sample of 450 recent former Soviet immigrants. The 25-item 2-factor solution obtained by Wagnild and Young (1993) was not supported by the Russian data. However, a modified 12-item Russian language version of the RS was, for the most part, reliable and valid: The standardized factor loadings and goodness of fit indices obtained from confirmatory factor analysis were acceptable, the internal consistency of one of the two subscales was very good, and the correlations between scores from the RS subscales and various measures of constructs that are theoretically linked with adaptation were in the expected direction and statistically significant.
