Abstract
Resilience is regarded as a capacity to adapt to the dynamic condition as a management to avoid disturbance and disaster. All this time, resilience is always embedded in local peopleâ€™s values. Actually in the tourism case, there is a resilience approach to avoid the disaster because of tourism activities or over tourism case. Tourist visits have created problems when local people or spatial spaces are unable to accommodate tourist needs. Based on this phenomenon today, it is important to focus on resilience thinking on tourist area, especially in this case cultural landscape heritage area. Resilience must be understood as the main aspect to explore the potential and the capability to adapt to the dynamic condition that is always changing. In architecture and planning approach, spatial is a human space that can show an interaction between human and nature with culture as media and all of them must be regarded as a holistic system with equilibrium and balance. In this study, the definition of resilience was explored by content analysis based on exploration of many texts in journals and books. It was then discussed by dialog theory between tourist, cultural landscape and resilience. Understanding resilience of cultural landscape with content analysis will create several conclusions that can become reference to tourism cases. To support the theory, this paper described one case of a tourist area chosen as national tourism destination that is Toba Lake area in North Sumatera.
