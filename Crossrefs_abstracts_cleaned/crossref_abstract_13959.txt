AbstractThis study aimed to evaluate a hypothesised structural model that reflects the relationship between gratitude, resilience, well‐being and counsellors' creativity. The study sample consisted of 610 psychological counsellors, aged between 25 and 45 years. This sample was divided into two subsamples: the first consisted of 241 counsellors to test the measurement properties of the scales used in this study; and the second consisted of 369 counsellors to evaluate the hypothesised structural model. Researchers prepared the gratitude scale, resilience scale and psychological well‐being scale, and they prepared the short form of the counselling creativity scale that was prepared by Al‐Waleedi & Arnout (2017). In order to detect how gratitude, resilience and well‐being can predict creativity, the proposed structural model was examined using structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings from the test of the hypothesised structural model concluded that the independent variables gratitude and resilience contributed directly to predict creativity as a dependent variable. At the same time, these independent variables contributed indirectly to the prediction of creativity as a dependent variable through the factor of well‐being. The hypothesised structural model of gratitude, resilience and well‐being shows goodness of fit with the empirical collected data and is able to predict creativity among counsellors. These findings are useful in providing gratitude, resilience, well‐being and creativity for practitioners in the field of psychological service, as well as drawing attention to the importance of gratitude, resilience and well‐being in providing effective counselling services in a creative way.
