PurposeThe purpose of this research is to validate an industry-wide definition of supply chain resilience (SCRES) within the Irish supply chain sector and measure the key elements of SCRES and their relative importance for Irish firms in light of Brexit.Design/methodology/approachSurvey method is used in this research. Data were collected from supply chain managers in Irish firms. Findings were analysed in accordance with industry sector and exposure to Brexit.FindingsThe results from the respondents confirm a willingness to define and utilise SCRES under a four-phase cycle; ready, respond, recover and grow. Focus on SCRES enablers shifts in accordance with cycle position. Understanding cycle position is paramount for successful execution of a SCRES strategy. Findings can be used as a basis for the development, implementation and management of a SCRES strategy.Research limitations/implicationsResearch was conducted at one specific point during Brexit negotiations. Sector specific and longitudinal studies are required to build upon this exploratory study.Practical implicationsSupply chain managers must ensure that phase position and enabler implementation are aligned to maximise the investment in a SCRES strategy. As a disruption event and its associated response evolve, management must demonstrate an ability to deploy and focus efforts on different SCRES enablers throughout the four-phase cycle.Originality/valueThis is the first research focussing on an industry-wide accepted definition of SCRES and its key enablers within Irish supply chains.
