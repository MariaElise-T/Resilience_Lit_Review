Timely response to the impact of climate change is a big challenge for the whole world, especially for developing countries. Within the framework of a country's transportation system, bridges play a crucial role in maintaining an efficient and well-connected road network. Ensuring their functionality is of paramount importance. However, climate change poses serious risks to the damage of bridge structures, jeopardizing traffic safety and potentially causing complete traffic interruptions. The aim of this paper is to present the current practice in Serbia regarding vulnerability analysis of bridges and the implementation of measures to enhance resilience.
