Cities around the world increasingly recognize the need to build on their resilience to deal with converging forces such as disasters, environmental degradation, urban sprawl, and climate change. Given the significance of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) for maintaining the quality of life in buildings and communities, improving their resilience is of high importance to governors, planners, and policymakers. Therefore, this study is proposed to spatially analyze the resilience of CINs in Saudi Arabia and to develop a holistic resilience framework for buildings and communities. The research method of this study involves a case study of Najran, including a collection of CIN data, history of natural disasters, and future potential hazards. The data were compiled to list the basic parameters required for the development of resilience criteria. Overall results show that CINs in the city of Najran were performing below average compared with the measurement criteria. The study highlights the need to make improvements in terms of the robustness, redundancy, and flexibility of the CINs in the city. Moreover, this paper proposes a holistic framework of key aspects of resilient criteria that need to be taken into account by the city governor, policymakers, and developer bodies for better management of available infrastructure and its development in future years.
