Organizational resilience indicates the capacity of an organization or a system to return to its steady condition, or exceed it, after going through a disruptive event that disrupts its steady condition. Qatar’s oil and gas sector has shown remarkable resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its preparedness and readiness to deal with such a disruption. As a lesson learned from the recent COVID-19 pandemic, local governmental institutions need to support national preparedness and resilience to handle emergencies and unpredictable crises by learning from the successful model of Qatar’s oil and gas sector. This study presents the key Resilience Engineering Indicators (REIs) that make this sector resilient and validates the six Resilience Engineering indexes or dimensions adopted, which include top management commitment, speaking up culture, learning, awareness, being prepared, and flexibility. The study evaluated the performance of these REIs using a 5-point Likert Scale survey questionnaire based on the relevance to resilience dimensions. The results show ten REIs contributing to the organization’s resilience and the top four most important Resilience Dimensions (RDs). Moreover, this is the first study to evaluate and assess the organizational resilience level in Qatar’s oil and gas sector. This study’s results can be integrated into different organizations’ strategies to improve the efforts to enhance the national response to disturbances in governance.
