Background: The current study was conducted to explore the level of career resilience among nurses working in medical centers affiliated with the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, and examine whether organizational education and other characteristics, such as background variables, have any effect on that resilience. This is of particular importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in nurses playing a more prominent role than other medical staff when dealing with infected patients and consequentially experiencing a greater impact on their career resilience. Methods: This research study was a descriptive correlational design using a stratified sampling technique. A total of 351 participants, all nurses from medical education centers affiliated with the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, were selected. Questionnaires covering career resilience, organizational education, and demographic items were used to collect the data. SPSS 22 was used to carry out the analyses, including t-tests, Pearson correlations, and linear regression tests. Results: The results showed that nurses had an average career resilience score of 56.4 out of a possible 100 with an average organizational education score of 48.6. Bivariate relationships revealed statistically significant associations between career resilience and organizational education (P<0.001), years of employment (P<0.001), and education level (P<0.05). Although there was no statistically significant relationship between career resilience and sex in the bivariate analysis, sex was found to be significant in the multivariable analysis (P<0.05). Conclusion: Organizational education is essential for nurses to maintain career resilience. To that end, hospitals and medical education centers should offer regular programs centered on enhancing career resilience and helping nurses manage job-related stress.
