Selecting appropriate and resilient suppliers is an important issue in supply chain management (SCM) literature. Making an effective decision on this issue can decrease external risks and disruptions, purchase costs, and delay times and also guarantees business continuity in the event of disruptions and, consequently, increases company competitiveness and customer satisfaction. This paper aims to provide a model based on identifying and investigating related criteria to evaluate suppliers’ resilience and select the most resilient suppliers in Iran’s electronic industry. To this purpose, the screening technique, the best-worst methodology (BWM), and goal programming (GP) have been applied in the fuzzy environment. The proposed model has been implemented and demonstrated by a case study of the electronic industry, as a real-life example. The results show that agility (0.227), compatibility (0.153), and vulnerability (0.102) are the most important factors for a resilient supplier.
