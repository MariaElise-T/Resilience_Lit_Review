AbstractAs longevity increases, understanding how a person maintains well-being and builds resilience to adversity becomes increasingly important. The present work (a) composes main cognitive elements into a universal psychological multisystem and (b) explains the factors that contribute to the function of this multisystem within physical space and across time. Drawing on established theories and previous findings, a theoretical reconstruction of a universal architecture serves to identify the principles a person needs to satisfy as a dynamic system that is governed by physical laws. A novel conceptual model generates testable hypotheses regarding how a universal cognitive multisystem, which is aided by a universal embodied emotional system, facilitates endless behavioral patterns in response to the environment. This theoretical framework compliments previous models and proposes that the nomothetic parameters of consistency, flexibility, self/others ratio and speed of meaning can explain inter- and intra-individual differences in psychological stability and resilience. The present work provides a comprehensive theory and methodological guidelines for the systematic assessment of well-being. This new approach to investigating well-being may open a new research direction and inform preventive and therapeutic interventions.
