In the development of novel strategies for control of invasive plant species, researchers might first consider plant performance throughout a range of habitats and then concentrate management activities in habitats where plants are least resilient. We determined the relative resilience of forest— and open—grown populations of the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Caprifoliaceae) growing in northern Kentucky. Resilience was assessed by imposing a clipping regime (once each year from 1986 to 1989) during which shrub resprouting abilities were measured. Habitat—specific population regeneration from seeds in the seed bank was also measured. Forest—grown L. maackii shrub were less resilient than open—grown shrubs when stressed by repeated clipping, due presumably to exhaustion of stored reserves in shrub bases. This suggests that forests are secondary habitats for L. maackii. However, resprouting potential and seed production in forests appear sufficient to regenerate populations after most common disturbances. The ability to modify sprouting patterns while maintaining resprounting ability and some seed production over a wide range of habitats is an important adaptation of this invasive shrub. Management suggestions for shrub eradication are provided.
