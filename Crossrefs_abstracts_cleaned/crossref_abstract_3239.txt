Internet Addiction Test by Young, Locus of Control (LOC-Scale) Scale developed by Rotter (1966) and The Brief Resilience Scale were used. Pearsonâ€™s product-moment correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between Internet Addiction, Locus of Control and Resilience. An independent t-test was used to test whether there is a statistical difference between gender and internet addiction at different levels. One-way ANOVA was used to investigate the gender difference in Internet Addiction, Locus of Control and Resilience respectively. The research findings show that there is a significant relationship between Internet Addiction, Locus of Control and Resilience as well as significant gender difference in Internet Addiction.
