The purposes of this study were to test the direct and indirect effects of personâ€“organisation fit (POF) and examine how self-efficacy (SE), resilience (RES) and job satisfaction (JS) acted as full or partial mediations between POF and employee work adjustment (EWA). A survey was conducted on 317 new graduates from the Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, with analysis of direct effects, indirect effects and mediators performed using the Hayes Process Macro Model 81. Results showed that POF had a direct effect on EWA with statistical significance and an indirect effect through self-efficacy, RES and JS, while SE, RES and JS acted as partial mediators between EWA with statistical significance. The mediating effects of SE, RES and JS were helpful in explaining the theory of POF on the work adjustment of new graduates. Results contribute to the development and expansion of POF in various industrial contexts. Human resource department managers can apply the study results as guidelines for selecting suitable employees as well as enhancing SE, RES and JS, leading to fast EWA. This study contributes to POF literature by clarifying the mediating effects of SE, RES and JS and clearly explaining the relationship between POF and EWA.
