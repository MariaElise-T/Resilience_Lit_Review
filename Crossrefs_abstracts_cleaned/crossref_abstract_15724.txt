 Ice patches are ubiquitous in polar regions and are a key element for landscape evolution. We present new insights into polar desert ice patch formation based on snow and ice properties at Ward Hunt Island (Canadian High Arctic, 83°N). Our results demonstrate that ice patches are composed of two distinct units. The upper unit is characterized by very fine granular and bubbly ice with a clear oblique layering. By contrast, the lower unit is strikingly different with coarse crystals, lower porosity, and a high frequency of fractures. For both units, superimposed ice formation at the base of the deep snowpack stands out as the primary ice aggradation process. The distinct properties of the lower unit likely result from a long period of kinetic ice crystal growth indicating a minimum age of several hundred years. A radiocarbon date of 3 487 ± 20 cal BP suggests that ice patches could potentially date back to the late Holocene. This old ice was recently truncated during warmer summers between 2008 and 2012, but the ice patch quickly recovered its volume during cooler summers. The old age of the ice patches and their rapid regeneration after melt events suggest their resilience to current warmer summers.
