Employees' job resiliency, work-life balance, and work values may affect their work performance. This study determined the levels and significant differences of the variables when grouped according to age, sex, length of service, and department assigned. Moreover, this study determined the relationship between job resiliency, work-life balance, and work values. This study employed a descriptive-correlational research design. One hundred five employees of a Catholic College were surveyed. Mean, standard deviation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman rho were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the employees have a very high level of job resiliency and a high level of work-life balance and work values. There were no significant differences in the employees' job resiliency, work-life balance, and work values across all variables. Lastly, job resiliency was positively correlated with work-life balance and work values. It can be concluded that employees can overcome, adapt, and cope with the different challenges while balancing their work and personal life and displaying positive work values. The management should prioritize maintaining resiliency since it has a significant relationship to their work-life balance and work values.
