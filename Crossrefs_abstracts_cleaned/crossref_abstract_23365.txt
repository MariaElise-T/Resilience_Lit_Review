Purpose: The current study developed a strength-based flourishing intervention (SFI) and examined its efficacy on fostering the resilience of people with physical disabilities in poor areas, using a randomized (1:1) parallel-group controlled, and single-blind trial. Method: A total of 51 participants ( M age = 42.16, standard deviation = 8.42; 43.14% males; 29 for the intervention group, whereas 22 for the control group) completed preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up tests. Results: The 2 Ã— 3 mixed repeated measure analyses and post hoc analyses revealed a significant main group effect ( F = 4.46, p = .04) and a short-term effect (i.e., 3 month; F = 6.35, p = .02) of the SFI. The results indicated that the SFI could significantly promote resilience in the intervention group. However, the effects of the intervention did not immediately appear. Discussion: The SFI could assist in providing research-based and cost-effective health services to promote flourishing and resilience in vulnerable populations.
