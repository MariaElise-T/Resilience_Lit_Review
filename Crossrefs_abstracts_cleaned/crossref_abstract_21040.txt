AbstractAimTo measure the prevalence of compassion fatigue among Chinese clinical nurses and to examine the effects of resilience and self‐efficacy on compassion fatigue.DesignA cross‐sectional descriptive survey was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guidelines.MethodsParticipants were recruited from three tertiary hospitals in central China from October 3 to December 15, 2019, using convenience sampling. Clinical nurses (n = 992) from different nursing departments completed the General Information Questionnaire, Professional Quality of Life Scale, Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale, and General Perceived Self‐Efficacy Scale. Descriptive statistics, t‐tests, one‐way analysis of variance, Pearson or Spearman's correlation analyses, and multiple linear regression models were used.ResultsNurses experienced moderate levels of compassion fatigue (burnout and secondary traumatic stress). Resilience and self‐efficacy were significantly negatively correlated with burnout but not with secondary traumatic stress. Linear regression analysis showed that resilience, self‐efficacy, exercise, and physical conditions were the main predictors of burnout. Only physical conditions and marital status significantly predicted secondary traumatic stress.ConclusionNurses are vulnerable to compassion fatigue in China. Resilience and self‐efficacy significantly negatively predicted nurses’ compassion fatigue. Physical conditions, healthy lifestyles, and social support are also important factors for compassion fatigue.ImpactOur findings can be used to generate targeted intervention and coping strategies for nurses to improve their resilience and self‐efficacy to alleviate compassion fatigue.
