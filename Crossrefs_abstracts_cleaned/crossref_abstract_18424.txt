Resilience aids nursing students in dealing with adversities during their nursing education. This study examined the relationship between nursing students’ resilience and relevant variables in the context of clinical education. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from 319 undergraduate nursing students in Northeast Thailand. The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Learning Experience Scale or the Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale, and the Stressors in Nursing Students scale were administered. A multiple regression analysis was performed for factors presumed to be associated with resilience. Results reported that Thai nursing students’ average resilience score was 71.79 ± 16.33. Multiple regression analysis indicated factors associated with resilience, in which social support (β = 0.354, p < 0.001, 95%CI: 0.240 to 0.469) and self-directed learning (β = 0.787, p < 0.001, 95%CI: 0.606 to 0.968) showed a positive association, while stress (β = −0.083, p = 0.025, 95%CI: −0.083 to −0.006) had a negative association. The final model accounted for 43.4% of the variance in the resilience score. In conclusion, self-directed learning, social support, and perceived stress among nursing students during clinical education are associated with their resilience.
