Background/Aims The importance of resilience among patients with chronic diseases has been demonstrated, but rarely among patients with heart failure. This study examines resilience and its relationship with spiritual wellbeing among this patient group. Methods This descriptive study was carried out with 130 patients with heart failure in Iran. The tools used were a 29-item resilience scale and the Paloutzian and Ellison Spiritual Wellbeing scale. Results The average resilience score was 107Â±19.5. Among the demographic variables, age, education, duration of disease and the presence of other concomitant diseases were significantly correlated with the patients' total resilience scores (P<0.05). The average spiritual wellbeing score was 83.12, with results showing a significant and direct relationship between resilience and spiritual wellbeing (P=0.001, r=0.386). Conclusions: Levels of resilience have a strong relationship with spiritual wellbeing among patients with heart failure. Therefore, building resilience should be incorporated into holistic care of these patients.
