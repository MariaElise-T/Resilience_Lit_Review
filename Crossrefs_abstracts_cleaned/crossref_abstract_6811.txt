This research aims to explore the significance of supply chain (SC) resilience by integrating SC-Resilience and SC-Ambidexterity concepts. SC-Ambidexterity refers to the simultaneous application of SC-Adaptability and SC-Alignment capabilities within the supply chain. In line with the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) of the firm, this research adopts a quantitative approach to investigate the relationship between variables in the context of manufacturing and production companies in Pakistan, specifically in Karachi. The results of this case study have revealed a strong positive impact of SC-Ambidexterity on SC-Resilience, confirming the significance of adopting concurrent and synchronized supply chain capabilities. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that SC-Agility plays a crucial role as a mediator in the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience. The findings suggest that organizations that proactively invest in developing both ambidextrous capabilities and agility are more likely to achieve a higher level of supply chain resilience, enabling them to effectively navigate turbulent business environments.
