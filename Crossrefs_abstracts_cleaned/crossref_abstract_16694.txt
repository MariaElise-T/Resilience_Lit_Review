Significance
A key problem for complex systems is achieving resilience through their (often nonlinear) interactions between components. Social insect colonies are natural examples of highly scalable systems that achieve homeostatic self-regulation based on local interactions. We describe a “functional core model” that we identified in three different insect societies (wasps, ants, and honey bees). This core model is based on self-regulation through a shared (limited) substance that works as an information center and as a buffer system simultaneously. This system has several adaptive properties, as it is robust against environmental disturbances and insensitive against parameter changes. Finding such a “common core model” is of high significance in understanding the discrete transitions from individuality to sociality in several animal species through convergent evolution.
