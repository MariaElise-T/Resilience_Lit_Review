AbstractSchool counseling activities have been delivered online during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This compulsory change has been associated with difficulties in school counseling services. The resilience and digital skills of school counselors are likely to influence the quality of counseling services and their attitude toward online work. Thus, we examined the role of resilience on their attitude toward online counseling services during the pandemic. We also looked at the role of digital skills on their attitudes toward online counseling. The sample consisted of 149 school counselors. We conducted structural equation modeling, in which the direct and indirect effects of resilience and digital self‐efficacy was tested. The results suggested that higher resilience was significantly associated with better attitudes toward school counseling. Moreover, resilient school counselors had higher digital self‐efficacy, which was associated with more positive attitudes toward online school counseling. The implications in terms of preservice and in‐service education of school counselors and interventions to promote resilience were discussed.
