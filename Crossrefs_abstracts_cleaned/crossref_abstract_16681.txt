 In this article, I review the literature on burnout and resilience among clergy. The existing research shows that the factors related to clergy burnout include the quality of interpersonal skills, relationships outside the congregation, establishment of peer/mentor relationships, the existence of high role expectations, personal spirituality and the ability to set healthy emotional boundaries. Recent studies using positive psychology as a framework identify a number of personal and situational qualities that promote resilience in clergy. Based on these findings, I suggest interventions that should be made by faith groups to better support clergy and make recommendations for further research.
