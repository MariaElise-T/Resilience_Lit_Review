 There is a generic sequence to any incident that affects an organisation or operation. It is represented by the incident sequence. This incident sequence provides a common time-performance reference for a variety of continuity planning tools, irrespective of focus or priority. These range from business continuity planning through to disaster risk reduction. The incident sequence has been developed over the last 7 years into a resilience planning framework that relates the time-performance relationship of an incident to the component-enabling functions of the operation, resource demand at each phase of operation restoration after the incident and both risk criteria and risk context. The framework allows the user to determine simply financial and operational tolerances and performance thresholds for resilience planning.
