AbstractA distributed cyber‐security and fault tolerance formation problem is considered in this paper. This is done though a multi‐agent system in which all agents concentrate on a formation reference function and accomplish a desired time‐varying formation even in the presence of malicious attacks and multiple faults. To achieve the resilient control task, a distributed control protocol using an event‐triggered technique and active reconfigurable strategy is proposed in the face of adverse effects for the overall system. When denial of service is launched by adversaries, the attack parameters are bounded by analyzing the Lyapunov stability theorem and the property of the Laplacian matrix. To improve the capability of fault‐tolerance, an observer‐based fault estimator is used to calculate fault values. The simulation results validate that the presented scheme can perfectly address the distributed formation issue with faults over attack intervals.
