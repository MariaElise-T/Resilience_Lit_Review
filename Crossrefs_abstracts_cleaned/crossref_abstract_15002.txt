AbstractAimIncreasingly frequent and intense disturbances of many kinds are reducing the populations of habitat‐forming species. For example, disturbances, including coral bleaching, storms and cyclones, coral disease and Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish (CoTS) outbreaks, have been important contributors to the global decline of coral populations. Understanding these the effects of such disturbances is challenging but necessary for their effective management. In this paper, we provide a novel spatially and temporally explicit perspective on the role of multiple and interacting disturbances on population dynamics.LocationGreat Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia.Time period1995–2011.Major taxa studiedAcropora species.MethodsA semi‐parametric Bayesian hierarchical model was used to estimate the form and strength of the cumulative effects of multiple disturbances that have affected coral populations at different locations, frequencies and intensities, and in different orders over 16 years. Boosted regression trees and random forest models were used to rank the relative importance of four types of disturbances in reducing the ability of coral populations to recover following disturbance.ResultsWe show that while all the disturbance agents examined had clear negative impacts, coral predation by CoTS was the strongest contributor to the decline of coral cover and resilience of coral populations. The effects of multiple disturbances on individual reef sites were overwhelmingly additive.Main conclusionsReduction of coral predation through control of CoTS could substantially reduce the severity of disturbances along the GBR and promote greater resilience, and thereby recovery, of coral populations.
