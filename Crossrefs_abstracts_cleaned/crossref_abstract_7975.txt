The research on equipment combat resilience evaluation is an important part of equipment combat resilience. Based on analyzing the form and the function of the equipment combat resilience evaluation system, a set of intelligent and integrated evaluation system is designed and developed by using UML Object-oriented Modeling Language. The system can achieve economic, quick and effective evaluation results by applying the Set Pair Analysis .The theory result of the evaluation is consistent with the experiment result by an example of the combat resilience evaluation of certain fighter.
