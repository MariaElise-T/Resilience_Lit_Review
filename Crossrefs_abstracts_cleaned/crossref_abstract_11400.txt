Resilience is considered as the ability of systems to cope (or adapt) with adversity over time. However, there is an ongoing debate around the resilience paradigm, and similarly, most resilience descriptions are often application specific. This article reviews various resilience models in the built environment such as the representation of resiliency and its characteristics (e.g., sociocultural networks), objectives (e.g., enhancing knowledge systems), challenges (e.g., adaption), and applications (e.g., climate resiliency and disaster). This paper aims to establish a foundation for further investigation in built environment resilience. Open issues are drawn toward the end of this article to reveal new research avenues to shed light and spark new interest in this research field.
