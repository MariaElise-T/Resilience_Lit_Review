Video content represents a large portion of global network traffic, and it is expected that this trend will continue as 4K video streaming becomes more popular and more applications such as entertainment and surveillance become available. Wireless networks are becoming the most important technologies for delivering cost-effective content, including video. The unpredictability of wireless channels, as well as the sensitivity of video content to packet losses, errors, and delays makes video delivery over wireless network difficult. Furthermore, when compared to wire links, congestion and complex traffic patterns make wireless channels much worse. Packet losses and network errors can be mitigated with the help of modern codecs. This study looks at the modern video codec H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and how to use the built-in error resilience tools to improve end-to-end video quality over simulated wireless networks. Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) was used and a framework for video quality assessment based on EvalVid 2.7 tools was employed.  We tested the performance of several coding structures in the presence of different intra coding techniques. Results for less active video sequences showed that the IBP coding structure with intra period of 18 achieved best performance at lower loss rates. The addition of an intra MB line or extra random intra MBs did not seem to offer extra protection against errors for these sequences. For more active video sequences, IBBBP coding structure without or with an intra MB line performed better than all other configurations at all loss rates
