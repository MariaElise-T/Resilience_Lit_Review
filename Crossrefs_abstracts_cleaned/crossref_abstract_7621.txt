Abstract

Objectives
To explore the resilience experience of new nurses and how new nurses develop and apply resilience strategies to cope with the difficulties during the transition period.


Methods
A descriptive qualitative research method was on data acquired using data semi-structured interviews with 12 new nurses aged 20–26 years whose working time was more than 12 months but less than 24 months.


Results
Analysis of the data could determine participants adopting resilience strategies to withstand difficulties and challenges in transition period. This period consisted of three main phases: “self-protection,” “undertaking challenges,” and “planning future.” The first-line nurse managers’ feedback and flexible shift scheduling paid a vital part in promoting the resilience development of new nurses.


Conclusions
Recognizing the importance of understanding and developing the resilience of new nurses in the transition period could greatly reduce the turnover rate and alleviate the shortage of nurses in global nursing workforce.
