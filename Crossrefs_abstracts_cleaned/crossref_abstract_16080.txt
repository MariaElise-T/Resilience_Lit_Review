Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress. Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed. The objective of this study was to explore the anxiety, perceived stress, and resilience in a population presenting at the general practitioner, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between February and April 2021 and 440 individuals who presented to the general practitioner were evaluated. Concerning anxiety level, almost half of the respondents (49,3%, N = 217) scored above the threshold value on the anxiety scale (mild intensity 38.6%, moderate intensity 9.9%, severe intensity 0.8%). Having a low level of resilience, as well as experiencing a high level of stress, are both predictive of the occurrence of high anxiety (p < 0.001, r = −0.551 and p < 0.001, r = 0.622, respectively). Furthermore, resilience is negatively related to perceived stress (p < 0.001, r = −0.676). It is critical in the current crisis to recognize those at risk of developing mental illnesses, taking into consideration the various socioeconomic classes, as well as to maintain and improve the general public’s mental health using appropriate psychological interventions.
