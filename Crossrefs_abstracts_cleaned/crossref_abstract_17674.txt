Key Messages

Current models of accommodation in academia fail to challenge liberal normative ideals of individuated autonomy and functionality and neoliberal imperatives of competition.
In a neoliberal context, upholding resilience as an ideal in the face of adversity individualizes hardships and adds to the strain of struggling individuals.
As academics we need to articulate and perform a radically different and subversive type of care centred upon relationality and inter‚Äêdependency.
