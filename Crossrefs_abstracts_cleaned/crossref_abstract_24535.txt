ObjectiveSupported self‐management interventions for individuals with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are needed. We examined the effects of a 12‐week resilience‐building energy management program (called RENEW) for fatigue and other patient‐reported outcomes.MethodsParticipants, who had physician‐diagnosed SSc, moderate to severe fatigue, and were ≥18 years old, were randomly assigned to RENEW or waitlist control in a 2:1 ratio. The RENEW intervention included an educational website/application plus nine virtual peer‐led health coaching sessions. The primary outcome was change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy‐Fatigue scale. Secondary outcomes were change in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures of pain interference and depressive symptoms and Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Multiple imputation was conducted; linear mixed models were used to assess group differences. A three‐way interaction with group, time, and SSc duration was examined in each model.ResultsAmong 173 participants (mean ± SD age 54.5 ± 11.7 years; 93% female, 85% White), 47% had diffuse cutaneous SSc; 57% were ≤5 years from diagnosis. At 12 weeks, compared to controls, RENEW participants had a clinically meaningful fatigue improvement (β = −4.7; 95% confidence interval −6.7 to −2.7; P < 0.001) and improvement in all secondary outcomes. Among RENEW participants, individuals with shorter disease duration had greater improvements in fatigue at 12 weeks.ConclusionAn mHealth supported self‐management intervention improved fatigue and other outcomes, particularly in newly diagnosed patients. This program may be broadly scalable for SSc symptom management.image
