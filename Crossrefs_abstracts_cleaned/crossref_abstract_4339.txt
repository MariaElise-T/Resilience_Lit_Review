Abstract
Motivated by advancement in distributed control schemes of microgrid (MG) network, this paper presents a noise resilient secondary control scheme for low voltage (LV) islanded MG network. For a LV MG the grid lines are highly resistive, hence conventional droop control results in poor stability and power sharing. A combination of droop-boost primary control with a noise resilient secondary distributed control is presented in this work. The presented control scheme achieves accurate power sharing and voltage and frequency restoration under noisy communication links for LV MG network. The communication links used for information sharing in secondary control are subjected to noisy environment; therefore the data received is corrupted with noise. The presented control scheme counteracts the noise effect for LV MG network. The performance of presented control scheme is evaluated by simulating a 4-bus MG test system in MATLAB/SimPowerSystem environment under different test scenarios. The obtained results envisage that the presented control scheme restores the voltage/frequency and provide accurate active power sharing in short time under load perturbation, varying noise parameters, and plug and play operating conditions.
