Spiritual well-being is integral in seeking meaning and purpose in life. Related to this is resiliency, which is a dynamic attribute of bouncing back from difficult situations. Thus, this descriptive-correlational study determines the degree of spiritual well-being and the level of resiliency of the diocesan seminarians of Antique. Spiritual Well-being Scale and Resilience Scale standardized tests were used. The findings indicate that the degree of spiritual well-being of seminarians is high which indicates that the seminarians possess a certain degree of satisfaction and manifest a clear sense of purpose in life. On the other hand, the level of resiliency of the diocesan seminarians of Antique is "on the low end" which signifies that as a whole, they might be experiencing some depression and anxiety in their lives. Finally, there is a significant relationship between spirituality and resiliency. The study recommends designing an enhanced career guidance program for the formation of the seminarians.
