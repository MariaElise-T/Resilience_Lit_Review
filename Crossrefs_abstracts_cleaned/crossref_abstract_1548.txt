Purpose:The purpose of the study was to measure predictors of community reintegration and empirically test the resiliency model of family stress, adjustment, and adaptation in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study also aimed to measure family needs by surveying caregiving family members through the use of the Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ). Primary caregivers of those with TBI were surveyed using a convenience sample accessed through the Brain Injury Association of Florida.Methods:Participants were asked to complete a multiple-choice questionnaire in exchange for a gift card. The questionnaire comprises demographic questions and five standardized instruments (Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales, Family Inventory of Resources for Management, Family Coping Coherence Index, FNQ, and Community Integration Questionnaire).Results:Results of the study validate the resiliency model and place emphasis on family coherence as the strongest predictor within the model. Results similarly support the importance of all other factors of family resiliency and addressing needs of the family specific to TBI.Conclusion:In closing, the article provides recommendations for counselors working with families with members with TBI.
