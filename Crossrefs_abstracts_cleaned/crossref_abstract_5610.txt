Cities around the world are having to become more resilient to the effects of climate change and ongoing development pressures and consequently are seeking to improve urban water resource management. In order to analyze the key factors affecting a cityâ€™s water resilience, this research establishes an urban water resilience evaluation model. The DEMATEL method is used to calculate the intensity of the interaction among the water resilience indicators and to establish their causal relationships. Then, an ANP structured diagram is established and the weighting of the water resilience evaluation index for the city of Wuhan is obtained using the Super Decisions software. The key water resilience factors for Wuhan are shown to have significant mutual influences, with the main factors found to be the utilization of rainwater resources, the utilization of reclaimed water, and the total annual runoff control of the city. This method provides a sound basis for the evaluation of urban water resilience with scope to extend this to other cities. The results provide useful guidance for policy makers and other key stakeholders in supporting more sustainable urban development.
