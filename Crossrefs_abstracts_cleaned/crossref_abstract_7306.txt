Advances in sustainable, resilient building can have little impact unless they are both affordable and easily repeatable. The SU+RE House was conceived with both of these imperatives firmly in mind. Guest‐Editor Clarke Snell, who was in the project's leadership group, highlights its emphasis on familiar rather than ultrahigh‐ tech materials, both minimising costs and facilitating the construction process. Describing its mechanisms in detail, he reports on how its flood‐proofing system was inspired by existing marine‐industry technology, with elements designed as standalone products that could be used in other settings.
