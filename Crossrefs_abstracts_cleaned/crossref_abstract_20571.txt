BACKGROUND: Acquired brain injury (BI) is associated with negative mental health outcomes for both people with BI, their caregivers (CG), and patient-CG dyads, which may be mitigated through increased resilience. However, little is known regarding the efficacy of resilience interventions focused on CGs of individuals with BI, as well as dyads, which may be instrumental for positive outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence of the efficacy of resilience interventions focused on CGs and/or dyads of individuals with BI. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL with Full Text, Scopus, SCIE, and ESCI was conducted. Each title and abstract were screened by two authors independently. Each full text review, study data extraction, and study quality assessment was performed independently by two authors. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: Out of 11,959 articles retrieved, 347 full text articles were assessed for review and 18 met inclusion criteria for data extraction and quality assessment. Resilience interventions were stratified into 5 different categories based on the type of intervention. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that dyadic/CG resilience interventions may improve mental health related outcomes, but conclusions were limited secondary to heterogenous outcomes and lack of a standardized resiliency construct. Future efforts are compulsory to create a standardized resiliency construct and associated outcomes focused on persons with BI, their CGs, and dyads.
