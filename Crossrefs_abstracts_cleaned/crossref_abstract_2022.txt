Today, the external environment is becoming increasingly turbulent and uncertain, marked by unpredictable political, economic, social and environmental changes. Adapting to these changes and overcoming the crises associated with unexpected disruptions has become an important challenge for both individuals and organisations. Resilience, meaning the ability to adapt and recover from crises, is becoming a necessary skill for all levels of a community: personal, organisational and societal. Organisational development through resilience is of particular interest to those managers and leaders who aim not only to ensure the survival of the organisation they lead under risk, but also to improve operations, strengthen teams, recover from crises and increase adaptability through agile management.
