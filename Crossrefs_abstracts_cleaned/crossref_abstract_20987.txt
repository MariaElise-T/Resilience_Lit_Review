AbstractIn this article, the issue of distributed sensor fault estimation with resilient property is studied for a class of multi‚Äêagent systems. Based on the relative output information, a novel fault estimation design is presented to estimate sensor fault and state vectors simultaneously. Meanwhile, the variation of observer gain is considered to improve the robustness of fault estimation observer. Furthermore, robust  performance is used to suppress the influence of external interference on sensor fault estimation error. Finally, simulations are provided to present effectiveness of the developed approach.
