 This paper focuses on the mixed [Formula: see text] and passive resilient control problem for uncertain discrete-time networked control systems subject to time delays. The measurement output is considered to be quantized by the dynamic quantizer before transmission through an unreliable communication channel, where the deception attacks may occur randomly. To further reduce the communication burden, the Round-Robin (RR) protocol is adopted to schedule sensors in a predetermined transmission order. Meanwhile, a new performance index is developed to solve restriction of the same dimension of control output and the exogenous disturbance. The S-procedure combined with a two-step uncertainties elimination method is adopted to deal with the nonlinear product terms involving multiple uncertainties. Furthermore, a decoupling method is introduced for static output feedback controller design. Sufficient conditions of the resilient controller and the dynamic quantizer are provided, which can improve the robustness of resulting closed-loop system and guarantee its stochastic stability and the specified mixed [Formula: see text] and passivity performance index. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.
