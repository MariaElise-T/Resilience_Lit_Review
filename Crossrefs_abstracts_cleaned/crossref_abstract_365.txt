India will experience massive urbanization in the coming decades, with the country's urban population expected to double by 2050. Climate change is a major threat to urban systems all over the world. Its consequences are expected to worsen over the next few decades. The consequences of climate changes are more in urban areas than rural due to rapid urbanization, health issue, decreasing water level and industrialization etc. Climate change consequences such as increased rainfall intensity, storm surges, temperature fluctuation and flooding are expected to have a global impact on urban health, sustainability, coastal areas, urban infrastructure, migrants, ecosystems and urban water use. On the other hand, humanity able to take collective action to mitigate the severity of these impacts. Mitigation and adaptation strategies, such as climate resilient agriculture, rooftop farming, extreme weather mitigation, resilient water use and so on, will almost certainly be required to deal with these effects. It is encouraging to note that urban planning has the potential to play a key role in developing and implementing adaptive responses in urban systems. The benefit of urban planning is sustainable and required some urban planning regimes around the world which include, plan-making, stakeholder engagement, development management and design standards to make a better and greener urban ecosystem.
