PurposeA review of the emerging scholarly literature on positive organizational scholarship indicates a need to pursue cognitive, emotional and motivational mechanisms which translate into positive states and outcomes in organizations. Responding to this, this paper aims to test a mediation model linking resilience and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) through subjective well-being (SWB) components (i.e. life satisfaction and affect balance) and organizational commitment (OC) components.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 345 employees working in the Indian manufacturing industry. The study used structural equation modeling using AMOS to conduct bootstrapped mediation analyses.FindingsResults showed that SWB and OC components mediated the resilience-OCB relationship. Results offered strong support for the role of affect balance (high positive and low negative affect) and affective commitment in mediating the influence of resilience on OCB.Originality/valueThe study not only tested the applicability of resilience in an organizational context to predict coveted positive outcomes but also identified the underlying mechanism as how psychological resource capacities like resilience contribute to OCBs.
