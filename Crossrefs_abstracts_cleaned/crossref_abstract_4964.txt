The growing complexity of the digital ecosystem in combination with increasing global risks involves various ethical issues associated with cybersecurity and resilience. This paper offers a conceptual resilience governance framework and design aspects for ethical and resilient cyber-physical e-health and e-wellbeing systems. Our safety and security thinking has been based on a supposition that inside defensive walls we are safe. The focus of our actions has been controlling our own systems, improvement of protection, and staying inside the protection. However, nobody can control complex large integrated cyber-physical systems, but on the other hand, coordination and cooperation is a salient point. In e-health and e-wellbeing, this means that the focus is shifting from the control and securing of health and welfare data in a silo to using that data to promote health and wellbeing worldwide in our connected world. On the other hand, we have an ethical need to complement the existing security and risk management knowledge base by developing frameworks and models where we are using, for example, artificial intelligence systems that enable network-wide flexibility and resilience management that strive to maintain and improve critical operations.
