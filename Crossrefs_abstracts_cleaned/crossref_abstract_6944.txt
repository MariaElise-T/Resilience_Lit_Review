Schengen has faced many difficulties since the very beginning but has proven its resilience. Although scholars tend to associate problems in the Schengen Area with a lack of solidarity, they fail to examine the concept of solidarity thoroughly. This article explores how solidarity in Schengen is perceived by the EU institutions and which of its aspects are emphasised. The methodological framework is based on the Discourse-Historical Approach which enables scholars to study solidarity in Schengen within a broad socio-political context. The theoretical background draws on the concept of solidarity. It follows from the analysis that solidarity in Schengen is inherently linked to external borders. Solidarity connected with internal controls is mentioned rarely, which contradicts the existing research on Schengen. Hence, a more detailed approach to solidarity is needed to interpret the resilience of Schengen. Moreover, the question to be raised is not how much solidarity is expressed or delivered within Schengen but rather which solidarity is concerned?
