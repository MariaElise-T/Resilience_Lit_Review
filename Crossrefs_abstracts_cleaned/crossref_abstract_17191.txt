AbstractRecent threats to human security (i.e., COVID‐19 pandemic, conflicts, climate change events) call for nurses to have an increased understanding of how sociopolitical environments induce mental health problems and impact the well‐being of citizens. This study examines the relationship between national resilience and life satisfaction among Filipino emerging adults, how depression mediates this relationship, and how these correlations are moderated by gender. Drawing from an online survey sample of 1020 Filipino emerging adults (18–29 years old), this cross‐sectional study utilised a moderated mediation analysis. Key constructs were measured using the short version of the National Resilience Scale (NR‐13), the depression component of the Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Gender was measured as sex assigned at birth. Descriptive results show that more than half of the respondents are female (64.2%) and demonstrate below‐average levels of national resilience and depression, and high levels of life satisfaction. Also, findings indicate that depression has significant negative relationships with, and partially mediates the positive relationship between national resilience and life satisfaction. Moreover, moderation analysis results suggest that being female synergizes the negative relationship between depression and life satisfaction, and being male strengthens the positive relationship between national resilience and life satisfaction (p < 0.01). The results highlight how the national resilience of emerging adults neutralises their risk for depression and, ultimately, improves life satisfaction. Moreover, the findings emphasise the importance of nursing advocacy actions to ensure that social policies for improving public mental health are gender‐sensitive, given that macro‐social and psychological factors have varied effects on individuals' lives based on gender.
