AbstractThis paper discusses the resilient H∞ performance for finite‐time boundedness of neutral‐type neural networks with time‐varying delays. The presented theoretical analysis allows establishing the finite‐time bounded of the real response of a delayed neural networks. In addition, we propose finite‐time stability conditions with time‐varying delay. By choosing an appropriate Lyapunov‐Krasovskii functional, and employing an auxiliary function‐based integral inequality and Wirtinger's based integral inequality, the sufficient criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The purpose is to design the system is not only finite‐time bounded with a specified decay rate but also satisfies an H∞ performance requirement. Theoretical results are tested through a numerical example.
