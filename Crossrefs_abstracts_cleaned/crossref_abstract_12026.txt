From pre-disaster to recovery, education is a fundamental key in reducing the impacts of disasters on children, people, and communities. This article aims to highlight the key components that are necessary for building school resilience to earthquakes and to demonstrate that promotion of the seismic resilience of schools is not only critical for childrenâ€™s safety and the continuity of their education but also for the effective post-earthquake recovery of communities. It is shown that promoting social cohesion through the improvement of the seismic structural safety of school buildings and the capabilities of school administrators with regard to shifting to an online teaching and learning mode during school dysfunctions or closures are key to the post-earthquake recovery of vulnerable communities in divided societies. This article can be of practical significance to educational administrators interested in school protection and in the continuity of educational services in the aftermath of disasters.
