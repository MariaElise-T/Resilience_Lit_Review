Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify correlates influencing career resilience of graduate nurses at five years post-graduation.Methods: A descriptive correlational design utilized using self-reported online questionnaires among 180 BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) graduates fulfilled individual career plan program (ICPP) credits in academic year 2013-2016. The data from 90 nursing graduates were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and regression.Results: Five years after graduation, the subjects’ career decision-making self-efficacy (<i>p</i>= 0.003) and career resilience (<i>p</i>= 0.006) scores were significantly lower than at final semester of BSN program, while career decision level seemed not to be changed. Among demographic characteristics, the effect of gender, current job field, length of employment and satisfaction in major on career decision-making self-efficacy, career decision level and career resilience were statistically significant. The model including career decision, career decision-making self-efficacy, and satisfaction in major significantly explained 72.2% of variability in career resilience of graduate nurses.Conclusions: Nursing educators implementing career decision-making self-efficacy and career decision level can increase early-career graduate nurses’ resilience by career planning and development program. The findings suggest that further research needs to develop a continuing education in professional career development that is to have a prolonged effect on BSN graduates career resilience.
