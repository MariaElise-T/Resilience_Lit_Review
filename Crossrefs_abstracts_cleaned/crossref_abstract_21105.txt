Cultural heritage is a significant part of the UN Agenda 2030 in making cities safe and resilient. Yet, the role of cultural heritage on resilience has not been sufficiently investigated. The study contributes to the discussion of the role of knowledge and practices in the prevention and recovery from risks within the frameworks of heritage preservation and community-based disaster management approach. The research aims to describe the knowledge about the heritage structures as well as the heritage-related practices of stakeholders employed in Calle Real, Philippines, an urban heritage zone in Iloilo City, Philippines. Through a social survey with 200 stakeholders, key results showed that respondents are aware that the unique character of Calle Real is worth preserving. Moreover, the multiplicity of uses of the buildings makes these prone to rapid wear and tear. Also, a majority of the respondents are aware of the buildings’ susceptibility to fire, seismic hazards, and strong winds. There is a gap, however, between the respondents’ awareness of the risks of the buildings and their heritage preservation practices. Few respondents reported being affiliated with heritage advocacy groups or to take part in actual conservation activities. There are possible ways to address the disparities in knowledge and practices with the goal of enhancing heritage resilience to natural & man-made hazards.
