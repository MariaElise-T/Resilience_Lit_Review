Understanding the patterns and underlying drivers of forest structure is critical for managing landscape processes and multiple resource management. Merging several landscape-scale datasets, including long-term fire histories, airborne LiDAR, and downscaled topo-climatic data, we assessed complex ecological questions regarding the interactions of forest structure, climate, and fire in the Yosemite National Park, a protected area historically dominated by frequent fire and largely free of the impacts of commercial industrial logging. We found that forest structure broadly corresponded with forest types arranged across elevation-driven climatic gradients and that repeated burning shifts forest structure towards conditions that are consistent with increased resilience, biodiversity, and ecosystem health and function. Specifically, across all forest types, tree density and mid-canopy strata cover was significantly reduced compared to overstory canopy and the indices of forest health improved after two fires, but no additional change occurred with subsequent burns. This study provides valuable information for managers who seek to refine prescriptions based on an enhanced understanding of fire-mediated changes in ladder fuels and tree density and those seeking to define the number of treatments needed to mitigate severe fire risk and enhance resiliency to repeated fires. In addition, our study highlights the utility of large-landscape LiDAR acquisitions for supporting fire, forest, and wildlife management prioritization and wildfire risk assessments for numerous valued resources.
