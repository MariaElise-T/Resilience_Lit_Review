Conflicts are a form of man-made disaster changing the economy of nations, influencing energy concerns, food, shelter and demographic distributions. The breakdown of global systems has become a huge concern that needs working mechanisms to develop resilient cities. The working mechanisms vary from one country to another, thus making the process a complex reality. Resilience is a word that was derived from the Latin word “resalire” which means “to spring back”. In this work, the housing environment was considered as a system constituting of several subsystems (Social, Environmental, Political, Economic subsystems). It argues that for resilience to occur within the post-conflict housing environment there is a need for an inclusive evaluation of users' preferences and expectations. With a focus on the social subsystem, it tried to determine the level of significance of gender, age, income and level of exposure on the perceived social character of a post-conflict housing environment and the satisfaction derived thereof. The study showed the importance of inclusivity as it influences perception and satisfaction. Using regression analysis, the study revealed that Perception and satisfaction within a post-conflict housing environment were influenced by age (73%), gender (74%), income and level of exposure (54%).
