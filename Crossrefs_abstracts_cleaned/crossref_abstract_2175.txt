Agriculture value chains are going through a paradigm shift, from efficiency‐driven industrial agriculture to resilience‐focused eco‐friendly agriculture. The nature of the paradigm shift is, to a certain extent, similar to the transformation taking place in many other industries (Lee 2014); its impact on the environment is, however, far‐reaching. This study intends to raise awareness of the challenges and trends in agriculture value chains and explores research opportunities through which operations and supply chain researchers can participate and contribute to the paradigm shift.
