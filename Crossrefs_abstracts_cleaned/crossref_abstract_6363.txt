Candaba Wetlands, a priority wetland and vital production landscape in the Philippines, exemplifies the intricate interplay between agriculture and ecology, providing a wealth of ecosystem services and enhancing the well-being of local residents.
This paper introduces an indicator framework for assessing the socio-ecological resilience of Candaba Wetlands, drawing upon a comprehensive review of resilience literature and the principles of Socio-Ecological Production Landscapes and Seascapes (SEPLS). The SEPLS resilience model underscores the interconnectedness of ecological and social systems, providing a robust foundation for the proposed indicator framework. The framework is organized around four key areas of SEPLS resilience: (a) ecosystem protection and biodiversity maintenance; (b) agricultural biodiversity; (c) knowledge, learning, and innovation; and (d) social equity and infrastructure.
Within each area, indicators are further delineated according to the ecosystem, agricultural, and social dimensions specific to Candaba Wetlands. This nuanced approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the wetland's resilience, capturing the complexity of its socio-ecological dynamics. Moreover, the framework serves as a valuable tool for engaging stakeholders in efforts to sustain and enhance the resilience of Candaba Wetlands, facilitating effective communication and collaborative decision-making.
