AbstractBackgroundDeveloping resilience at work is an effective primary preventive measure for occupational stress. The study aimed to adopt a tool and measure current resilience levels and determine the association of work‐related characteristics on resilience among Sri Lankan nurses.MethodsTranslated, culturally adapted and validated Resilience at Work Scale‐ Sinhala version (RAW‐S) was used to measure resilience levels in a sample of 855 government nurses from a health district. The mean RAW‐S scores were calculated and appropriate cut off points were used to determine the prevalence of ‘high’, ‘moderate’ and ‘low’ resilience. Chi square test was used to determine the associations.ResultsThe overall mean RAW‐S score was 69.6 (95% CI = 68.9–70.3) and the scores ranged from 28.5 to 90.3. Only 28.4% (95% CI = 25.4–31.6) of nurses showed ‘high’ level of resilience at work, while 55.6% (95% CI = 52.1–58.9) & 16.0% (95% CI = 13.7–18.7) had shown ‘moderate’ and ‘low’ levels of resilience respectively. The resilience levels differed significantly (p < 0.05) by type of ward that they work and by work experience.ConclusionsThis was the first study that examined the resilience levels in any health care worker category in Sri Lanka. The need of targeted, well‐designed resilience building programme for ever burdened government sector nurses is clearly shown from the results, as more than two thirds of nurses had ‘moderate’ or ‘low’ level of resilience, which may not be good enough to combat the constant work stress they face on daily basis.
