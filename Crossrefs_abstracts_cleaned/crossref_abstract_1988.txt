This papers deals with the new design of resilient wheels with high radial elasticity comparing another designs. The aim of this new wheel design is to increase passenger comfort and noise reduction during service of tram cars in cities. Tyre of the wheel is designed also as brake disc. In this paper will be describe also results of laboratory test of the wheel stiffness and comparison with previous wheel generation including other wheel parameters. Because primary role of the wheel is done by rubber segments also its results will be described.
