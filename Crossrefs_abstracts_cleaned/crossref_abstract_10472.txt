This study analyzes how citizens' satisfaction with governance values and perceived government performance affect public trust in government in China and South Korea and explores its implications for building resilient communities. The results of the study show that the level of satisfaction with democratic governance values and the government's performance in dealing with political corruption, the economy, and human rights are all significantly associated with trust in government in China. Government performance in dealing with political corruption and the economy is significantly associated with trust in government in South Korea as well. Government officials' attention to citizen input is significantly associated with trust in local government in both countries. Trust in people was significantly associated with trust in government in China only. Finally, implications of the study findings for building resilient communities and future research agendas are discussed.
