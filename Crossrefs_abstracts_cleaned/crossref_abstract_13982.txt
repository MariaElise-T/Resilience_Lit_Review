Background normalization algorithms attempt to suppress the ambient and self-noise during the measurements of sonar, which enhance the detection performance and the display effect of weak signals. Conventional background normalization methods are usually sensitive to the accuracy of prior set filtering interval and threshold, while significant noise is still detected in low frequency. In this paper, an improved background normalization algorithm is proposed by thresholding the processing interval between several local peak values and local valley values. Compared to the existing scenarios, the proposed approach automatically calculates the filtering interval and threshold, with substantial resilience to the noise level in low frequency. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
