AimResilience, the ability to cope with disasters and significant life adversity, is an important factor to consider when studying the mental health of populations affected by a disaster. Although high school students in a community affected by a disaster should have specific characteristics of resilience, little has been reported on the issue. This study was designed to provide initial data regarding characteristics of the resilience of high school students affected by a catastrophe.MethodsA total of 760 high school students in Natori City, which was devastated by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, were profiled, and a 3‐year longitudinal study was conducted with 254 students who had entered the school in 2012. Resilience was evaluated with the 10‐item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Japanese version, the Zung Self‐Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised were also administered to assess the students’ mental health.ResultsAmong the students who entered the high school in 2012, 28.6% showed high resilience, and the proportion increased to 42.9% in 2013 and 46.6% in 2014. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Japanese version and Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores decreased significantly over the 3‐year study period, but there were no significant differences in the Zung Self‐Rating Anxiety Scale scores over time.ConclusionThis initial study profiling the characteristics of resilience among adolescents suggests that resilience is a highly changeable component of mental health among people who have faced adversity. Resilience can be a useful indicator of recovery from adversity and a target of interventions for improving mental health conditions.
