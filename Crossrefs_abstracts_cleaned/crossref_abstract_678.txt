When students feel safe expressing their emotions without the fear of being ridiculed by peers (or adults) they can open their minds to learning. It is imperative that educators take an active role in implementing programs that identify students struggling with mental health issues and provide interventions to teach healthy coping strategies so that students are able to be more active participants in their education. There are many ways in which educators can work with adolescents; providing tools to effectively manage emotions can assist students in moving forward, problem solving, decision making, and connecting with others. It is suggested that individuals with more highly developed emotional intelligence are more successful personally and professionally. This paper explores the relationship of emotional intelligence and resiliency in adolescents and how it relates to academic and personal success. Explanations of emotional intelligence and resiliency are given. Several techniques and methods of building these skills are explored as well. A review of peer reviewed articles and studies are included.  Keywords: Emotional intelligence, resiliency, student success, adolescent mental health, Goleman, Reivich, Shatt√©
