Abstract
Hospital epidemiologists, infection preventionists, and antimicrobial stewards are integral to the pandemic workforce. However, regardless of pandemic surge or postsurge conditions, their workload remains high due to constant vigilance for new variants, emerging data, and evolving public health guidance. We describe the factors that have led to burnout and suggest strategies to enhance resilience.
