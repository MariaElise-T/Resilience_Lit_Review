AimTo describe the levels of work engagement, and to analyse the reciprocal relationships between social support, empathy, resilience and work engagement among haemodialysis nurses in China.BackgroundWork engagement is a critical workplace health indicator. Previous studies have examined work engagement perceived by nurses working in diverse hospital wards, or a specialty area (emergency care or intensive care), no previous studies have highlighted work engagement and its affecting factors among haemodialysis nurses.MethodsParticipants in the cross‚Äêsectional study were 345 haemodialysis nurses employed in 17 hospitals in Chengdu, China. Hierarchical regression analyses were carried out to analyse the relationships between social support, empathy, resilience and work engagement in haemodialysis nurses.ResultsResilience was the strongest positive significant contributor to work engagement, followed by other support and perspective taking (cognitive empathy). Nurses with longer occupational tenure reported higher levels of work engagement. Male nurses also reported greater work engagement than female nurses.DiscussionInfluence of work engagement was explored by social support, empathy and resilience, reflecting the need of haemodialysis nurses to understand the significance of focusing on their personal and environmental factors.ConclusionsPositive resilience, other support and cognitive empathy can result in increased work engagement.Implications for nursingTraining programs, such as mindfulness meditation training and empathy skills training, are recommended for nursing managers to enhance resilience and empathic capacity in nurses.Implications for nursing policyNursing policies should be developed to establish supportive work environments in clinical practice settings and to support the education and training of psychological resilience and empathic capacity in order to foster work engagement.
