 This article asks how the Catholic Christian Meta-Model of the Person might identify the personal capacities and interpersonal resources needed to strengthen cliniciansâ€™ self-care practices and build up their resilience. The Meta-Model provides 11 comprehensive principles, or premises, to better understand the person, by integrating a theological, philosophical, and psychological vision of the person (anthropology). It serves as a framework to contextualize therapeutic modalities, formulate case studies, interpret empirical studies, and make clinical applications. The article argues that the Meta-Model's interpersonal approach can help build up the self-care and resilience of clinicians (and clients) through attention to the resources available in their personal vocations, character strengths, and practice of virtues. Empirical evidence and clinical examples are provided to support the theoretical implications of the Meta-Model's principles.
