Background: One important key to an organization’s long-term competitiveness is the ability of first line managers (FLMs) to handle their role as a leader in daily work. FLMs main task is to contribute to a high and stable production output according to customer demands from an input that is characterized by instability and variability. To do so, FLMs must develop resilient action strategies – ways of working and daily problem solving that systematically facilitate to cope with instability. In this study protocol we present a methodological approach developed to evaluate and improve these.
Methods/Design: The research approach is collaborative and developmental and performed together with two companies. The approach integrates and extends the theory and application of a model on interactive research and a framework on activity analysis. It will be applied using data collection techniques like interviews, diaries, observations, document analysis, and questionnaires. The analysis and development stages will be performed both separate and in collaboration in workshops and the result is planned to end up in the joint writing of a generic handbook on advantageous action strategies for FLMs’.
Discussion: This study contributes with a new integration of two methodological approaches which provides a novel way to understand and develop dynamic on-the-job behaviour in work settings.
