This study used a national sample of professional counselors (N = 161) providing services during the COVID‐19 pandemic to examine the extent to which perceived stress, coping response, resilience, and posttraumatic stress predict burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that resilience had a strong positive relationship with compassion fatigue and a strong negative relationship with burnout. Perceived stress was also strongly positively related to burnout. Implications and strategies for counselors to mitigate the effects of perceived stress during the COVID‐19 pandemic by engaging in self‐care practices and cultivating resilience are provided.
