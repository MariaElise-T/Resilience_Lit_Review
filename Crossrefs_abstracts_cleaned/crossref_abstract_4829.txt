The increasingly pervasive influence of technology on a global scale, coupled with the accelerating pace of organizations operating in cyberspace, has intensified the need for adequate protection against the risks posed by cyber threats. This paper aims to identify cyber resilience management attributes that can enable organizations to sustain and continually adapt in the face of evolving cyber risks and threats. The researcher explores the intersections between cybersecurity and resilience by reviewing existing frameworks, models, studies, and surveys. This study establishes the attributes of resilience with the integration of resilience theory and security theory, along with their position in the cyber domains. By proposing a converged model with fundamental factors for attaining cyber resilience, this study offers a novel contribution to cyber security management.
