            Pregnancy can be a colossal change for some women, with the commencement of motherhood possibly generating emotional health problems, including peripartum depression (PPD). PPD significantly affects the parent-child relationship, which is the foundation for the socioemotional development of the child. In this article, we reviewed the association between PPD and resilience, and identified their mediators and moderators. Eight studies were included after a rigorous screening process. There was a significant relationship between PPD and childhood resiliency, resulting in an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Maternal sensitivity and emotional availability were possible mediators. Maternal education, income level, maternal trauma, life adversities, marital conflicts, and perceived social support were reported moderators. This article highlights the need for timely recognition and treatment of PPD with targeted interventions to improve the parent-child relationship.
