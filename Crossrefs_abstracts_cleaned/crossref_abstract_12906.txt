This study first explores the relationship between employee psychological ownership, organizational resilience, and social support by combining the relevant literature, constructing a theoretical research model, and proposing hypotheses. Through statistical analysis of 332 valid questionnaires, the results show that employee psychological ownership positively impacts organizational resilience. Also, social supports positively affect organizational resilience and organizational identity in employee psychological ownership, and social supports and organizational resilience both play an intermediary role.
