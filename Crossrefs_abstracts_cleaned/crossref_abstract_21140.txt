AbstractAs social work under normal circumstances is already a stress‐laden helping profession, this study intended to examine the level of psychological distress among the frontline social workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic and whether resilience and organizational support played a part in mitigating their psychological distress. Frontline social workers from various social service sectors across Singapore were surveyed using two standardized measurements to assess resilience (Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale 25) and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21). A self‐designed questionnaire comprising 10 items measured “personal” and “work‐related” support at the organization. Sociodemographic data were captured using a structured questionnaire. The results showed that the frontline social workers, although resilient, were psychologically distressed in all the three areas of depression, anxiety and stress. The results indicated that those working in the Family Service Centers (FSC) were the most affected. Significant correlations were observed between psychological distress, resilience, and organizational support. Organizations must be mindful that support can help frontline staff who are usually younger and less experienced during challenging times such as the pandemic. Building the resilience of social workers will prepare them for their daily challenges and those that accompany unexpected situations.
