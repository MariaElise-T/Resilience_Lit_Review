Since the start of the pandemic, organisations have recognised the importance of resilience strategies and they have been trying to enhance them for future crises. COVID-19 has profoundly affected the way that organisations operate and react to recent events. The lessons from this pandemic for future adverse events are yet to be understood. This study aims to identify the most prominent issues and gaps in the literature regarding organisational resilience in the context of COVID-19. To achieve this, this paper is conducting a bibliometric literature review of 185 articles discussing organisational resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 2019 to the beginning of 2022. This paper identifies six main topic clusters: (1) entrepreneurial, tourism, and emergency responses; (2) world environment, disruptions, and organisations; (3) employees and mediation; (4) firms and opportunities; (5) capabilities and digitalisation; and (6) leadership during uncertain times. The main contribution of this study is an up-to-date identification of research concerning organisational resilience in times of crisis, particularly research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 is a unique crisis, this pandemic, as well as the timely results of this paper, stand out. In light of this, I believe one can develop innovative, fundamental new directions for resilience literature in the future.
