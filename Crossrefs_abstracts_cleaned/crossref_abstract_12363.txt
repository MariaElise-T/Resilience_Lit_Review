Abstract
Efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect have primarily focused on family deficits, including poverty and parental psychopathology. Models of resiliency, which are focused instead on family adaptation and strengths, offer an alternative to deficit-based practices. Although child-focused resilience studies are common in the field of child welfare, few focus on parents. The authors employed a mixed-methods study to understand how mothers involved in child welfare use resiliency strategies—including belief systems, organizational patterns, and open communication—to overcome adversities. Mothers (N = 129) at risk for child welfare involvement completed a quantitative survey, with 38 completing a follow-up qualitative phone interview. Both survey and interview asked a variety of questions on everyday adversities and coping. Two mothers were assessed as nonresilient. However, a majority of mothers exhibited resiliency, including consistent daily routines, peaceful homes, and family mealtimes. A strong aspirational belief system, not necessarily stemming from a faith tradition or community, provided both parents and children hope in times of trouble. Further, open communication with children about stressors was common. The authors’ results showed that resiliency strategies are being utilized by families typically defined as “at-risk,” and that child welfare professionals should consider focusing prevention efforts more on family strengths than on shortcomings.
