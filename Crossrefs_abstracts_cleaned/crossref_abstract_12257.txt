PurposeResilience is the ability to recover and once again adapt former behaviours that have characterized an individual, prior to the period of disruption. It requires various qualities, resources and power to recover immediately after a traumatic event and is found related to a number of variables and concepts. The purpose of the study is to examine the relationship of long-term orientation and risk propensity on resilience using structural equation modelling (SEM).Design/methodology/approachR Program was used to perform SEM on the data collected online from 357 samples using three standardized questionnaires to measure long-term orientation, risk propensity and resilience.FindingsIt was found that long-term orientation and its factors, respect for tradition and planning, were having a positive relationship with resilience. No relationship was found between risk propensity and resilience.Originality/valueA fair review of literature has found that no previous studies have examined the relationship between long-term orientation and risk propensity on resilience. The present study is a modest effort towards this direction. The findings are indeed significant and contribute substantially to literature.
