Background: Canadian First Nations (FN) people have experienced and continue to experience significant adversities, yet many demonstrate aspects of resilience. Aim: The aim of this qualitative study was to specifically understand Cree adults’ meanings and mechanisms of resilience following maltreatment. Methods: Ten Cree adults were interviewed individually. Modified grounded theory was used to interpret the transcribed interviews. Results: Participants discussed resilience as a journey of ‘survival’ and ‘overcoming’ and pathways to healing that were multifactorial and included traditional teachings. Conclusion: Mental health providers should consider and incorporate these mechanisms into treatment for Cree people, when appropriate, to aid recovery.
