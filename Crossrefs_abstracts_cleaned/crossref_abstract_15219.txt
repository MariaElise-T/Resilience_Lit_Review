This study intends to know whether the Resilience Index established in the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA) can be redefined based on Gaussian distribution. Based on quali and quantitative analyses, the study was performed using two sets of data obtained with 1268 students, between 9 and 18 years old, enrolled in four schools. The results were discussed statically with the Gaussian distribution. The results provide a precise way to classify the group of students in five different levels of resilience, which are established based on the standard deviation. The results show that the low and high Resilience Index levels represent groups of approximately 16% of the studied population. The possible correlation between the average Resilience Index of a particular school with the Human Development Index, where the school is located, is also discussed.
