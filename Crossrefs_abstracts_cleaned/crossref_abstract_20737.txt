Abstract
Background
The resilience and Quality of Life (QOL) of adolescent cancer survivors was compared with those of children with other diseases to identify the patterns and factors that affect resilience and QOL The purpose of the present study was to compare the resilience and QOL between adolescent blood cancer survivors and adolescents with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals. Ninety-four adolescent blood cancer survivors and 81 adolescents with CHD completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding resilience, QOL, and general characteristics. Independent t-test and ANCOVA were used to compare the resilience and QOL between adolescent blood cancer survivors and adolescents with CHD.

Results
The resilience of adolescent blood cancer survivors was significantly lower than that of adolescents with CHD, and the QOL of adolescent blood cancer survivors was not different from that of adolescents with CHD.

Conclusions
The experiences of adolescent blood cancer survivors were different from those of adolescents with CHD even though they are of the same ages. Adolescents with chronic disease have a different level of illness controllability and self-regulation according to their disease and situation. Therefore, health-providers need to develop the specific programs for improving resilience and QOL of adolescents with chronic illness with focusing their characteristics and situations.
