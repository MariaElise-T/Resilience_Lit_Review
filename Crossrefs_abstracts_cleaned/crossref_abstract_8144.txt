 We studied resilience related to childhood experiences of famine in Ethiopia. We sought an understanding of how young Ethiopians survived and coped with the devastating effects of famine. Participant observations and in-depth interviews at an orphanage in Addis Ababa with eight boys and girls (ages 18 to 23), survivors from famine catastrophe in Ethiopia 1984-1985, were conducted. Significant resilience factors identified were faith and hope, having a living relative, and having memories of one's past roots. Exposure to famine and multiple early losses may have long-term effects on an individual's capacity to maintain resilience. We discuss how an understanding of resilience can be applied in different cultural settings. Future research on resilience in Africa is suggested to increase our knowledge base of this concept.
