Abstract
In the past years, the food industry has been challenged by several factors: increased natality, accelerated growth of urban areas, higher prices. All the above are turning into a growth vector which may seem like a great opportunity for farm owners. Despite the favorable context, the farmers are facing their own issues trying to cover a big demand, through eco-friendly ways. This paper explains the importance of ensuring resilience for small farmers. In general, farmers are adaptive entrepreneurs, but they need support through agricultural policies, a coherent legislative framework, and a substantial package of economic measures. The modern Romanian farmer will be able to streamline their supply once they learn how to optimize their sustainable business plans. The increased yields are determined by both technological processes and responsibility for the environment. Promoting small farmers and stimulating their access to the market is defining for the future of food security.
