Although there is extensive literature on the risks faced by families dealing with cumulative challenges, including the emotional and behavioural problems of the child, limited research exists on the potential resilience of these families. Additionally, there are a lot of ambiguities in family resilience research with respect to indicators of good outcomes while facing risks. Therefore, this study aimed to answer the following research questions: 1) What risks do family members recognise that they are facing?; and 2) How do family members perceive good outcomes in the context of the risks that they are facing? To answer these research questions, we conducted group interviews with 8 families whose children, aged 12 to 18 years, manifest emotional and/or behavioural problems. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. For the first question, the results highlight one theme - Families with complex needs: multiple risks at different levels. Four themes contribute to answering the second research question: Survival, Not giving up and asking for help, Positive change, and Wish for togetherness and good communication. The families reported three indicators of good family outcomes, while striving for the fourth (Wish for togetherness and good communication), suggesting that outcome indicators can be distributed on a “continuum”. However, family members also reported that as they cope with and resolve the challenges they face, new risks emerge that may take the family back to an earlier stage, emphasising the circular rather than linear nature of this continuum. All participating families stressed that togetherness can be achieved with more professional help and time. The findings of this study address the importance of strength-based approaches in practice that will provide a space for fostering resilience in families facing chronic and cumulative risks.
