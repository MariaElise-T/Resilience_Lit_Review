Abstract
Falling Ball Testing (FBT) is a recommended method for testing resilient modulus of subgrade soil, which brings about a higher requirement for modulus test. This paper focuses on a method for testing and calibration of the equipment of FBT. Both ways have been implied in testing modulus and the result has been analysed as well. The subject of testing includes nylon and PPR as standard elements. The supplementary equipment includes measuring tape, electronic scale, EWE (Elastic Wave Testing) and FBT. The indicating error and deviation ratio varies with 10% when the unit is well fixed. And the height brings about little affection for the result of modulus when the unit is well fixed. The method applied in this paper can also be used in the calibration of FBT device. And the proper height in the test is 0.2m during the calibration of FBT equipment.
