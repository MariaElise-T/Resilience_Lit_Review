Stress at work, vulnerability to stress, job failure, chronic fatigue, anxiety, neuroticism and extraversion, self-concept, seem to be accompanied by significant emotional discomfort and may increase the likelihood of the individual developing behavioral changes. In this context, we aim to analyze the perceived stress, resilience and its possible correlation, considering the sex, in volunteers from undergraduate students of pharmacy course in Unicamp. We conclude that women are more stressed and less resilient because they spend more time in the stressful situation trying to solve it, not trying to avoid it. There was an inverse correlation between stress scores and resilience scores in women.
