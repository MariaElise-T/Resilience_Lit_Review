This study looks into the dynamic capabilities theory and its relationship with organizational resilience by drawing on a sample of select Filipino live music performers, specifically rock bands. A qualitative thematic analysis approach was used to answer the research questions with the help of transcribed interviews and online data. The pandemic gave rise to several obstacles. To overcome these challenges, the bands exhibited dynamic capabilities. Key themes in each of the capacities of the dynamic capabilities framework were seen, for example, Digital Transformation and Vicarious Learning under Sense, and Changing the Songwriting Process and Evolving Future Outlook under Transform. This study can help business organizations, artists, and workers in the live music industry cope with fast-changing environments and crises. This research can also serve to understand dynamic capabilities in more detail.
