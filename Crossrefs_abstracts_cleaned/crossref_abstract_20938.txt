AbstractObjectiveTo identify longitudinal trajectories of depression in the first 6 months following limb loss and to explore baseline predictors of trajectories, including pain and demographic factors. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether trajectories of depression were associated with elevated symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) at 6 months.DesignSecondary longitudinal data analysis of an inception cohort study of persons with new‐onset limb loss. Participants completed assessments at three intervals (initial, 3 months, and 6 months).SettingHospitalized care, acute rehabilitation, ambulatory care, and community.ParticipantsParticipants were recruited from consecutive cases of amputation surgery in a metropolitan hospital system over a period of 4 years (2002–2007). The final sample (n = 203) was predominantly White (79.3%) and male (78.8%) with an average age of 49.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 14.6).Main Outcome Measure(s)Depression was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9); posttraumatic stress symptoms were measured via the PTSD checklist– Civilian Version (PCL‐C).ResultsFour trajectories of depression were identified via Latent Growth Mixture Modeling: Resilience (73.2%), Chronic Depression (11.2%), Emerging Depression (8.9%), and Recovery (6.7%). Average pain intensity significantly predicted trajectory membership. Membership in the Chronic Depression class predicted elevated 6‐month PTS compared to all other classes; membership in the Resilience class predicted lower PTS than in the Chronic and Emerging Depression classes but did not differentiate from the Recovery trajectory.ConclusionsFindings reveal that the course of depression post‐amputation is heterogenous, with varying profiles of symptom development, maintenance, and remission. A majority of individuals were classified as Resilient, whereas a substantial minority of individuals developed clinically significant depression between 3 and 6 months (Emerging Depression), suggesting that early screening during acute care may be insufficient. We detected a significant prospective relation between depression trajectories and distal PTS, advancing the potential clinical utility of trajectory modeling as a risk surveillance tool.
