Abstract
Due to high temperatures and increased traffic loads, most of Iraqâ€™s streets suffer from permanent distortion problems, especially in streets where there are checkpoints, therefore, there are needs for reports and researches specialized in improving the pavement layers and increasing their resistance to temperatures and high traffic loads to reduce the rut depth. In this research, the VESYS 5W program was used to find a potential value for rut depth, where ordinary asphalt mixes and improved asphalt mixes were used using SBS polymer at 4% by weight of asphalt were it is evaluated according to different properties of these mixture and the resilient modulus one of these properties for it is importance. The results showed that when the value of the resilient modulus increases, the rut depth decreases, as the rut depth was reduced by 42.5% for the surface layer and 73% for the base layer
