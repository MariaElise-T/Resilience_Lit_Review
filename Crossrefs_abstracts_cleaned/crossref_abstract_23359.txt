AbstractRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to investigate normal brain function in healthy participants and as a treatment for brain disorders. Various subject factors can influence individual response to rTMS, including brain network properties. A previous study by our group showed that “virtually lesioning” the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; important for cognitive flexibility) using 1 Hz rTMS reduced performance on a set‐shifting task. We aimed to determine whether this behavioural response was related to topological features of pre‐TMS resting‐state and task‐based functional networks. 1 Hz (inhibitory) rTMS was applied to the left dlPFC in 16 healthy participants, and to the vertex in 17 participants as a control condition. Participants performed a set‐shifting task during fMRI at baseline and directly after a single rTMS session 1–2 weeks later. Functional network topology measures were calculated from resting‐state and task‐based fMRI scans using graph theoretical analysis. The dlPFC‐stimulated group, but not the vertex group, showed reduced setshifting performance after rTMS, associated with lower task‐based betweenness centrality (BC) of the dlPFC at baseline (p = .030) and a smaller reduction in task‐based BC after rTMS (p = .024). Reduced repeat trial accuracy after rTMS was associated with higher baseline resting state node strength of the dlPFC (p = .017). Our results suggest that behavioural response to 1 Hz rTMS to the dlPFC is dependent on baseline functional network features. Individuals with more globally integrated stimulated regions show greater resilience to rTMS effects, while individuals with more locally well‐connected regions show greater vulnerability.
