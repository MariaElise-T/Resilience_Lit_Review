AbstractResilience refers to an individual's ability to thrive despite adversity. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD‐RISC). Three undergraduate samples (ns < 500) were used to determine the factor structure of the CD‐RISC. The first two samples were used to conduct exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the third was used for confirmatory factor analysis. The EFA showed that the CD‐RISC had an unstable factor structure across two demographically equivalent samples. A series of empirically driven modifications was made, resulting in a 10‐item unidimensional scale that demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity. Overall, the 10‐item CD‐RISC displays excellent psychometric properties and allows for efficient measurement of resilience.
