The vibrations and stability of a plate having a finite length were considered in a flat supersonic flow, having adopted an assumption that one of the edges of the plate has a hinged support, and the other edge is free. Another support was located in an internal point of the plate and featured resilient attenuation properties. A compressive force, called the follower force, was applied within the plane of the plate in a direction tangent to the deformed surface of the plate. This way, a superficial system was forced in which two independent physical factors occurred and caused its self-excitation. Therefore the superficial system could be termed a ‘double self-excited system’. The solution of the equations of motion for the system was derived with a Laplace transformation.
