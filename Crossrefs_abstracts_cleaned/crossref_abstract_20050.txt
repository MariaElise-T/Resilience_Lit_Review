In the course of the study, it has been found that the increase in volumes and the expansion of the spheres of the use of digital technologies objectively cause the emergence of cyber threats and expose all participants of digital ecosystems to cyber risks, which restrains economic development. It has been proven that the presence of a wide range of factors that shape cyber security and cyber resilience requires the implementation of a comprehensive approach to the formulation of protective strategies of companies and institutions. The article argues that the process of organizing cyber resilience management should be based on the development of comprehensive cyber protection systems based on clear policies, rules and strategies for early detection, prevention and minimization of consequences of the implementation of cyber threats using a wide range of technical, technological, organizational, managerial and regulatory measures. The author justifies the need to develop national strategy and program for the authorities in the spheres of legislation, regulation, supervision and control over the state of cyber security. He proves that the national cyber defense strategy should provide for effective measures to protect critical infrastructure objects, state authorities and the population, as well as a system of regulatory and supervisory measures. The author establishes that the primary task for the organization and operation of cyber protection systems should be the protection of digital assets and of the companies’ resources and their customers. In order to strengthen the institutional capacity of authorities to effectively support the national cyber security ecosystem, a structural and logical scheme of interaction between companies and the State Cyber Protection Center of Ukraine in the process of exchanging information about cyber incidents has been developed, and practical recommendations have been provided for the interaction between critical infrastructure objects and state regulatory bodies, which can be used to ensure nationally rooted stability and security of Ukraine’s economic development in a hybrid "peace-war" system.
