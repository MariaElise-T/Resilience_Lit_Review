On February 24, 2022, russia unleashed the first continental war in Europe in the 21st century, undermining the system of collective world security established after World War II. The aggravation of hostilities and the scale of the destruction of Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure objects actualize the issue of national resilience research. The aim of the article is to substantiate the national resilience of Ukraine as a necessary condition for countering russian aggression, as well as to identify directions for its support. General scientific and special methods have been used: theoretical generalization, system analysis, systematization, statistical, grouping, and scientific abstraction. Ensuring national resi­lien­ce for Ukraine can be considered as a new stage of state building and restoration of sovereignty. National resilience determines the reaction of the state and society to internal and external challenges and threats. However, in the conditions of war, an important component in the development of national resilience is the international support of partner countries, which can satisfy the key needs of our state with their resources and diplomatic efforts. Such support includes the provision of humanitarian and military aid, financial assistance, and participation in international diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and restore peace. The russian-Ukrainian war caused a series of global challenges that destabilized the international security environment. Key among them are: food, energy, humanitarian, security and environmental global challenges. Restoring global stability and countering new challenges is a common goal for all stakeholders. Using the Peace Fund’s approach to assessing the level of national resilience, the spheres of Ukraine’s national resilience were analyzed and its vulnerabilities were identified. The process of ensuring national resilience is multi-vector and requires careful planning and financing in all directions.
