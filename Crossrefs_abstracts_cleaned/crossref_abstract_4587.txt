 Extreme loading events such as blasts, impacts and earthquakes often lead to the partial or total collapse of reinforced-concrete structures, resulting in economic and human life losses. Civil engineers have therefore been seeking innovative materials and systems that would allow the design of resilient and smart structures that can withstand such catastrophic events. Recently, engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) and shape memory alloys (SMAs) have emerged as strong contenders in the production of smart and resilient structural systems. This paper examines recent research work into the performance of structural members produced with ECCs and/or SMAs for applications in new structures as well as in strengthening and retrofitting work. The constraints on wider implementation of these materials in structural applications are discussed. It is shown that the superior performance of SMA-reinforced ECC elements under static and dynamic loading could allow the development of novel resilient composites with exceptional impact performance to protect infrastructure of paramount importance for homeland security against explosive, dynamic and impact loading.
