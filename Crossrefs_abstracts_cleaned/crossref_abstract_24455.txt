As the COVID-19 pandemic fades, the aviation industry is entering a fast recovery period. To analyze airport networksâ€™ post-pandemic resilience during the recovery process, this paper proposes a Comprehensive Resilience Assessment (CRA) model approach using the airport networks of China, Europe, and the U.S.A as case studies. The impact of COVID-19 on the networks is analyzed after populating the models of these networks with real air traffic data. The results suggest that the pandemic has caused damage to all three networks, although the damages to the network structures of Europe and the U.S.A are more severe than the damage in China. The analysis suggests that China, as the airport network with less network performance change, has a more stable level of resilience. The analysis also shows that the different levels of stringency policy in prevention and control measures during the epidemic directly affected the recovery rate of the network. This paper provides new insights into the impact of the pandemic on airport network resilience.
