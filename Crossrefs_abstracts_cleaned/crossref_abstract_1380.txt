Abstract
The paradigm shift in flood management from hard measure to soft measure tends to increase because current flood relief mitigation systems could not answer the flooding issue. The questions are how the concept of resilience in flood mitigation can be applied to urban landscape planning and how its prospect for future research. The purpose of this essay is to examine the paradigm shift in flood control in a number of countries, as well as the future prospects for a flood resilient strategy to urban landscape planning. A literature study was conducted on journal articles and other scientific articles related to flooding and resilience using PRISMA protocol to obtain a narrative and perspective of this paradigm shift. In the initial conclusion, the concept of flood resilience in several countries has proven to be applicable for flood mitigation, but itâ€™s still facing an obstacle like the governance aspect (assignment of positions, roles, and responsibilities between actors). From 213 selected articles reviewed, only 32% of the research has the substance of resilience and urban planning. This means research on flood mitigation with a resilience approach is still needed for future urban planning. The expected impact, this paper can be used as input for existing urban planning and future research in landscape scale.
