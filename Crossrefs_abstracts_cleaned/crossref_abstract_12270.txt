Professional ethos encompasses individual factors such as attitudes and expectations, and commitment and responsibility, as well as other social factors related to collaboration or identification with role models. All of these factors are expressed in professional experiences and routines. Practicum experiences within teacher education programmes contribute to the initial expression and formation of students’ professional ethos. This study aims to analyse how the restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the formation of future teachers’ professional ethos and their resilience skills. The study analyses the assessment discourse of the practicum during two academic years affected by the pandemic, involving a sample of n = 725 students. The Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) Biplot and Reinert’s Alceste methods were employed to examine differences in the discourse based on gender and developmental changes over the two academic years. The results highlight the significant impact of limitations on routines as a determining factor. Additionally, both collaboration with professional tutors and innovation stood out as variables in the development of professional ethos. Gender differences revealed more negative expectations among female students, while, per year, there was a more positive evolution in learning expectations among male students. In conclusion, the practicum experiences during the pandemic-affected academic years facilitated the development of students’ professional ethos, emphasising resilient attitudes and solutions.
