The United States Marine Corps (USMC) continues to prepare for conflict. A mixed method study explored leaders’ perception of cognitive agility and mental resilience preparedness for future challenges in planning, mission execution, and decision making. An online survey and in-person interviews addressed two research questions (RQ); What are the perceptions of leader preparedness to exercise cognitive agility and mental resilience for future challenges? What impact might a focused Decision Forcing Case (DFC) have on preparing leaders to exercise cognitive agility and mental resilience in planning, mission execution, and decision making for future challenges? Thematic coding of the data formed the literature themes and shaped a theoretical framework. Data analysis results identified three key points; Refine instruction to develop proactive, agile thinking leaders, increase confidence to prepare Marines to be proactive in uncertain and ambiguous environments, and be diligent with recommended revisions to curriculum design and implementations of educative approaches to best prepare leaders for future challenges. A summary of the findings discussed three future implications for designing education and training; Ensure leaders understand and exercise cognitive agility and mental resilience, develop courses and practical exercises focused on preparation for future conflict, and research, create, and incorporate focused DFCs, Tactical Decision Games (TDG), and Kriegspiels (KS) to evaluate and elevate Marines’ cognitive agility and mental resilience in planning, mission execution, and decision making for future challenges. Conclusively data supports leaders’ plans to develop and deliver deliberate curriculum to prepare leaders for 21st conflict.
