The purpose of this study is to suggest improvements in disaster relief and welfare support activities by measuring the relative importance of disaster relief factors to strengthen the resilience of COVID-19 disaster victims. The main results are as follows. First, it is recognized that the support principle is more important than the support subject in disaster relief and welfare support activities. Among the elements of the support principle, the principle of timeliness was found to be the most important. Second, it was found that the local government recognized as the first priority rather than the central government in the relative priority of each measurement element for the support subject. Third, it is necessary for local governments to expand their participation in order to increase the active participation of residents. Fourth, it is necessary to build a system that can check network capabilities. As a result, increasing the capacity between local governments and local residents can help to strengthen the resilience of disaster victims.
