Drawing on the Conservation of Resources theory, this study analyzes whether resilience could be related to healthcare providers’ wellbeing and professional self-efficacy, both directly and indirectly, as mediated by ethical vision of patient care and moderated by managerial support in dealing with ethical issues. Overall, 315 Italian healthcare professionals employed in neuro-rehabilitation medicine or palliative care specialties participated in this multi-centered cross-sectional study. The following variables were investigated: resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), wellbeing (Maugeri Stress Index–Reduced), professional self-efficacy (Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey), ethical vision of patient care and managerial support in dealing with ethical issues (Italian version of the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey). Overall, resilience was positively associated with healthcare providers’ wellbeing and professional self-efficacy, directly and indirectly, as mediated by ethical vision of patient care. Highly resilient healthcare professionals who perceived the presence of a positive ethical vision of patient care in their workplace were more likely to experience greater wellbeing when managerial support in dealing with ethical issues was high (vs. low). Thus, these findings provide suggestions for tailored interventions sustaining healthcare professionals along their daily activity characterized by high-demanding and challenging situations.
