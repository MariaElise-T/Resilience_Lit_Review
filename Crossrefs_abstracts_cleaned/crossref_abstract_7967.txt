ABSTRACT

Background
Patients with burn injuries resulting in visible disabilities may face negative emotional experiences during rehabilitation. Understanding the development of resilience in these patients may help those who are seeking methods to better adapt to their new situation.


Purpose
This study aimed to explore the development of resilience in patients with burns during their convalescence.


Methods
Ten patients with burn injuries who were convalescing in a general hospital in China were recruited and enrolled as participants. Data were collected using recorded, semistructured in-depth interviews and analyzed following the principles of grounded theory.


Results
The development of resilience in patients with burns included five stages of “black hole,” “introspection,” “integration,” “practice,” and “growth.” Both internal and external protective factors were identified. The internal protective factors included hope, sincerity, will, belief, and curiosity, and the external protective factor was mutual relationships that reflected the qualities of caring, support, sharing, commitment, and intimacy.


Conclusions
Resilience was achieved gradually over several progressive steps through the five stages (black hole, introspection, integration, practice, and growth). The results of this research may provide insights and support to patients who seek to improve their adaptation to new situations.
