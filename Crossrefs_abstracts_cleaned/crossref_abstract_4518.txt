The research assesses the effect of the crisis management approach and its effect on the corporate resilience of telecommunications companies. The concern with the analysis is that telecommunications companies are under internal and external pressure, which may lead to a true crisis concerning corporate resilience and the resulting loss of productivity and lower earnings. To achieve the objective of the analysis, the self-governing questionnaire was used to collect data. It has been produced and circulated to a survey of 84 respondents. The study states that the different facets of crisis management, such as; Changing Path Strategy, Reserve Mobilization Strategy, Group work Strategy, Crisis Fragmentation Strategy, and Crisis Containment Strategy have potent influence overall on the resilience of telecommunication firms. In the light of this, the study advises that; Businesses should have a center for the training of company leaders and managers and equip them with the requisite capacity to cope with crises. There should be greater interest in the conduct of studies and scientific study and advanced field studies in the area of crisis management, and in collaboration with major organizations and organisations with considerable expertise in this field, businesses should develop effective policies and techniques that lead to crisis management.
