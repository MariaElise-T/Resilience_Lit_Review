 The resilient modulus of roadbed soils is a required input parameter in pavement analysis and design. Most recent research has concentrated on the laboratory resilient modulus test and its correlations with other engineering properties determined from laboratory tests. However, little effort has been focused on calibrating the laboratory resilient modulus measurements using field performance data. The results are presented of an experimental program to evaluate the field bearing characteristics of in-service pavement subgrade layers and to conduct the laboratory resilient modulus measurements on the reconstituted soil samples simulating the field moisture and density conditions. A simplified procedure was adopted for comparing the laboratory equivalent resilient modulus values with the modulus of elasticity of the subgrade layer obtained from the field plate load test. The laboratory resilient modulus test results compared reasonably well with the field plate layer moduli.
