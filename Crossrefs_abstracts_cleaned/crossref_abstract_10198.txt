Introduction: The use of resilience engineering principles is a commonly used method for the assessment of crisis management in hospitals as a part of the health system. The present study aimed to evaluate crisis management based on the seven principles of resilience engineering in selected hospitals affiliated to Yazd University of Medical Sciences in 2021.
Methods: In this study, a crisis management evaluation questionnaire based on the seven principles of resilience engineering in hospitals was used. The reliability and validity of this questionnaire were confirmed by Azadian et al. in a previous study. The required data were collected from administrative and clinical managers and nurses. The mean score of the seven principles was obtained, making it possible to compare crisis management in all three selected hospitals (Shahid Sadoughi, Afshar, and Shahid Rahnamoun) in Yazd.
Findings: The mean score of resilience engineering principles was determined, and the overall crisis management score of each hospital was determined. The mean scores of crisis management were calculated at 136.53, 135.23, and 132.07 out of a total score of 220 in Shahid Sadoughi, Shahid Rahnamoun, and Afshar hospitals. Nonetheless, the mean score in flexibility and preparedness components in some hospitals was below 0.6 of the total score.
Conclusion: The situation of crisis management in all three hospitals was evaluated to be at a good level. However, some corrective measures were required to be implemented in some components to improve crisis management in all three hospitals. It is necessary to take appropriate measures to enhance the preparedness of the three hospitals in different aspects of crisis management, especially flexibility, to arrive at a more favorable level.
