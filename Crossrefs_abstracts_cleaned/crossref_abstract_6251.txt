Background Health disparities and lack of resources in rural Appalachia have compounded the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet resilience may facilitate healthcare providers' ability to overcome difficulties. The purpose of the study was to explore the perception of resilience among healthcare providers in rural Appalachia.  Methods Qualitative interviews explored the perceived experience of resilience among 18 healthcare providers working in rural Appalachia during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Results Four themes were identified, including the personal meaning of resilience, developing resilience in self and in others, running in crisis mode, and rural culture as a source of strength.  Discussion Findings of the qualitative study demonstrate that adaptive resilience strengthened healthcare providers' dedication to caring for their patients and communities. Internal sources such as self-care and optimism and external sources, including support from family, friends, and community, were critical in healthcare providers' resilience during the pandemic. Characteristics and experiences particular to the people in rural Appalachia may contribute to their inner strength. The study findings highlight the importance of promoting resilience among healthcare providers in the region who experience high levels of personal, professional, and community stress.
