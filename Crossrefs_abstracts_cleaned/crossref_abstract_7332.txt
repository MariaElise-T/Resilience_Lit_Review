This is a critical review of an article based on the experiences of Epidemic Preparedness and Response pillars as they built resilient health systems while responding to various emerging and re-emerging adverse events. The premise of the article is to explore the need and outline advantages of resilient health systems to those responsible for health outcomes at all levels, for effective public health action amidst adverse contexts. The article may be considered as objective and unbiased due to the peer review process. The article was published in a journal that provides a forum for a broad discussion of global health issues that range from systemic violence to infectious disease outbreaks. The article has contributed to literature and provides a basis for achieving resilience, improving public health action and indicates areas for further development of the knowledge base of health systems research. However, it is suggested that the concept of responsiveness be reemphasized and paired with resilience to improve the performance of health systems.
