In this paper, a print-scan resilient image watermarking scheme based on Radon transform and DCT(discrete cosine transform) is proposed. The watermark is preprocessed with a chaotic sequence, then the host image is transformed to frequency domain by block DCT. The preprocessed watermark is adaptively embedded into the transform domain coefficients by modulating the relationship between neighbor coefficients. The watermark detection process is accomplished without referring to the original image. Simulation results show good robustness against several attacks, such Jpeg compression, cropping, filtering and so on.
