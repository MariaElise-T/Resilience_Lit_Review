Water distribution through pipe networks is considered a significant in human civilization. The percentage of population served by these networks is increasing continuously and the reliability studies of these networks are given more importance. In the recent years, resilience a form of reliability of the system, of water distribution networks, gained significant focus. Some of the popular resilience indicators developed by researchers are critically analyzed in this work. The limitations of the resilience indicators presented in this paper indicate the necessity to improve the indicators and develop new robust indicators
