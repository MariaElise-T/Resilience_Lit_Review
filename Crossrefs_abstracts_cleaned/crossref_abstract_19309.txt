Applying the livelihood resilience theory to the relocation of coal mining villages, the present study explored the levels and the factors hindering livelihood resilience among farmers under different relocation models. This has important implications for enhancing the livelihood resilience of farmers during coal mining relocation and promoting rural revitalization in coal mining areas. Based on the livelihood resilience framework and the actual conditions of mining areas, we formulated an evaluation index system, employed the stratified mean square deviation method to determine weights, used the comprehensive index method to assess the livelihood resilience level, and investigated the obstacles to livelihood resilience among farmers under different relocation models using the random forest model. The results indicate the following: first, the overall livelihood resilience level in the coal mining relocation area of Huaibei City is low and is not significantly different among the four types, with the ranking being as follows: central village agglomeration type > township-centered village construction type > mining-village combination type > suburban community type. Significant differences exist in the indicators and dispersion levels of the resilience dimensions of buffering capacity, self-organization ability, and learning ability among farmers under different relocation models. Second, factors such as household deposits, labor force quantity, social networks, and participation in village collective meetings significantly affect the livelihood resilience level of farmers. However, the degree of influence varies under different relocation models. Third, improvements such as increasing employment opportunities, investing in education resources, and building social networks are necessary to improve farmersâ€™ livelihoods under the four types of relocation models.
