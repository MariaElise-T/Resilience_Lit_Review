AbstractThe val66met polymorphism of the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene has been identified as a potential moderator for the relationship between chronic stress and executive functioning. However, whether the presence of the met allele increases cognitive vulnerability or resilience to stress has yet to be determined. Given the established effects of autonomic activity and psychological arousal on executive functioning, in the present study, 56 healthy university students completed self‐report measures of chronic stress, positive arousal (vigour) and negative arousal (anxiety) and measured heart‐rate variability to quantify autonomic activity. Participants then completed a cognitive test battery that measured attention, decision‐making, visual learning and working memory. Regression analyses demonstrated that Val/met participants performed better on attention and working memory tasks than Val/val participants, but no differences were seen in decision‐making and visual learning. Further, Val/met participants were protected from stress‐related differences in attention seen in Val/val participants. Val66met was not associated with physiological or psychological arousal. This study demonstrates that val66met plays an important but selective role in cognitive performance.
