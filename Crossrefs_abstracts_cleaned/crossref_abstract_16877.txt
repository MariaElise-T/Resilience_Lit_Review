AbstractResilience is of the upmost importance to deal with everyday problems faced by communities. The concept of community resilience is gaining prominence in disaster management policy and practice, and it has been shown to be an important factor during pandemic recovery such as during the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak. We present an instrument for community resilience assessment adapted for disasters like the pandemics. The instrument was based on the theory‐based and evidence‐informed Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit (CART) Assessment Survey, adapted for the first time to Portuguese. Another strong feature of this study relates to the targeted participants, namely human service workers (598). They are key informants for their close involvement with communities. This version of the CART was reliable. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good relationship between the observed variables and their underlying latent constructs. Moreover, tests for measurement invariance across participants showed that differences in factor variances and covariances were not attributable to age‐based differences in the properties of the scales themselves. Our findings support the fundamental idea that it is worthwhile to have an instrument to measure community resilience. Thus, our study adds to the evaluation of the CART, supporting its value as a robust instrument to measure resilience at the community level in different countries.
