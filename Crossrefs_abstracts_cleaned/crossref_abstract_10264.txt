Purpose of the study: This exploration was intended to check the link of generosity upon resilience, spirituality, and psychological adjustment among youth.
Methodology: Purposive sample of volunteer Youth workers (N = 175) of welfare and charity organizations from three major Pakistani cities (age range 19 to 28 years both male and female) were part of the study. International Personality Item Pool scale; sub-constructs of Generosity and Spirituality from Values in Action scale, Psychological Well-Being (PWB), and the Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were used to measure concepts in the current exploration. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23 version. Pearson correlation was used to check correlation among variables. The prediction was checked through linear regression. Lastly, an independent sample t-test was used to analyze demographics.
Main Findings: Significant positive relationship of generosity with spirituality, resilience, and psychological well-being among youth was found. Spirituality was positively predicted by generosity; whereas psychological wellbeing was positively predicted by resilience. Female youth had high generosity and was more resilient but spirituality and psychological well-being were the same across genders. Youth from joint families was more generous and resilient than those from nuclear families.
Implications of this study: Study findings have sound practical implications for policymakers, community activists, and social / health psychologists to understand the generosity phenomena and how it can be vital for building a sustainable and progressive community. Suggestions for future researchers along with present study limitations have also been discussed.
Novelty/Originality of this study: This is empirical research and all the data is based upon natural human behavior without any manipulation.
