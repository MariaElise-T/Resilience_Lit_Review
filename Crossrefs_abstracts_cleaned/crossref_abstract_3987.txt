            Anxiety is one of the most common psychiatric conditions affecting adolescents and youth in the United States, with over 30% of adolescents having an anxiety disorder of any type. The conventional approach to anxiety management can include medications that in some patient populations can increase the risk of suicidality. Untreated anxiety and sequela of anxiety can have a significant impact on the life of a child and can impact them into adulthood. Integrative treatments in the setting of anxiety and stress management can be used along with conventional approaches to evoke the relaxation response. Integrative approaches can also teach children and youth tools that may serve to help them learn to better manage the symptoms of anxiety and build resilience throughout their lifetime.
