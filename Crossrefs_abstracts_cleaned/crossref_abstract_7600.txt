This paper discusses how the beaches of Marbella, on the southwestern Mediterranean coast of Spain, may no longer stay in their natural resilience envelope due to a critically delicate natural sediment transport balance and a degree of artificialization that has entered the whole sedimentary system into a new resilience state. The combination of vigorous terrain and millenary human action and disruptions across and alongshore on the coastline have increased stress on sediment availability. Although sediment circulation in the coastal cell has often been studied, the investigation of the connection between soil loss and river sediment transport and retention at a major dam remains a challenge. In this article, a first-order sediment yield prediction was established by using a GIS-based model applied to the area’s main river basin, and validation of model results is provided by empirical measurements of sedimentation in the main reservoir lake of La Concepción using Differential Global Positioning System (D_GPS)/Echo-sounder combination and measurements from remotely piloted aircraft compared with preconstruction blueprint topography documenting spot heights where sediments accumulated or eroded over 50 years. The marine circulation is interpreted from previous research by the authors that established a source-sink pattern similar to the Atlantic platform-fed marine system that originated the significant Cabopino dunes. The significant erodibility that we have estimated seems matched by potentially high sediment accumulation rates along selected profiles and spot heights across the bottom of the reservoir lake, and, in combination with the marine circulation model, our results identify that sediment budget key elements in Mediterranean settings, such as soil loss, sediment entrapment in reservoirs, and the coastal marine circulation, are in a state of deficit that suggests that the resilience envelope is surpassed and the system as a whole is entering a new resilience state in which the engineering factor is key. Some ecosystem services, such as the protection offered by the natural resilience of the beach and dune system of Cabopino, are no longer recoverable in the current artificialization state of the system as a whole.
