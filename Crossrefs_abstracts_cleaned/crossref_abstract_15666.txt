The single-stage cluster was sampling method; twenty-seven females were randomly divided into the trial (n = 13) and control groups (n = 14). The Connor‐Davidson resilience scale (CD‐RISC) was used as questionnaire. The data were analyzed by multivariate covariance analysis. Results: There was a significant change in the interpersonal competence, negative affective tolerance, and spiritual effects in the post-test in the experimental group compared with the control group. According to the Eta coefficients report, the most effective issue was the perception of individual competence with the effect and difference equal to 34% in post-test scores, which was the effect of ACT. Conclusions: It appears that acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) may be an effective intervention in improving psychological resilience in drug abuser women.
