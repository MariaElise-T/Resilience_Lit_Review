Introduction:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers have been in great fear due to the high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection at any time. This study aimed to determine the mediating role of resilience on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and burnout in primary care healthcare providers in Malaysia. Methods: This was an online cross-sectional study involving 1280 healthcare providers aged 18 years and older from 30 government primary care clinics in Malaysia. We used the COVID-19 Fear Scale, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale, and the Short Brief Resilience Scale to collect data from the respondents. Smart-PLS was used to perform mediation analysis. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 36 years old and mean duration of working experience was 11 years. The majority of the respondents were female (82.4%) and Malays (82.3%). The study population consisted of nurses (47.4%), doctors (26%), medical assistants (11.9), healthcare assistant (7.1%), medical laboratory technicians (6.4%) and drivers(1.3).The results show that fear of COVID-19 positively predicts burnout. According to the results, resilience mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and all the three burnout domains, namely personal burnout (β=0.175,p<0.001), work-related burnout (β=0.175,p<0.001) and client-related burnout (β=0.172,p<0.001). Additionally, resilience reduces the impact of COVID-19 fear on the three domains of burnout. Conclusion: Our study has reported a mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and burnout.
