The main objective of this paper is to identify the design criteria for a BIM Education Resilient System STEM program. The curriculum's development will semantically relate to resilience concepts with Systems Engineering and Building Information Modeling (BIM) practices and standards. The Sustainable Facilities and Infrastructure in Constrained Environments' (SuFICE) in advancing STEM to Support Facility Design, Construction, Operations and Maintenance collaborative project is to be led by The National Institute of Building Sciences, and Total Learning Research Institute. The participating organizations intend to: engage representatives from across the building and infrastructure industry to revise existing STEM curricula and materials and develop new curricula and materials that recognize the role of science technologies important to both education and the building industry.
