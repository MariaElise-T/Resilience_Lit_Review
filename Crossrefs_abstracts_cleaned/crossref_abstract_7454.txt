The present study aimed to analyze gender difference in resilience and aggression of three developmental stages (adolescence, early adulthood, and middle adulthood). For this, comparative research design was utilized. Through purposive sampling, 600 participants (Mage = 28.24 years, SD = 12.12) with males and females equal in number; were selected from different regions of Karachi, Pakistan. Participantsâ€™ demographic information was collected through Respondent Information Form. Resilience and aggression were measured using The Brief Resilience Scale and Short Form of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, respectively. Data was analyzed through independent samples t-test using SPSS. Results indicated that overall, resilience was significantly higher in males. In adolescence and early adulthood, resilience was higher in males than females, however, in middle adulthood, insignificant gender difference was noted in resilience. Further, overall non-significant gender difference was found in aggression; nevertheless, physical aggression was significantly higher in males, whereas, anger was higher in females. Moreover, insignificant gender difference was also found in aggression concerning the three age groups. This study would help in understanding the role of gender in resilience and aggression in different developmental stages. Additionally, it would assist in developing gender and age specific programs for fostering resilience and managing aggression.
