The physical limitations of people with disabilities who work need resilience skills to survive and adapt at work. This study aimed to determine demands, resilience, and social support for disabled persons in the workplace. This study used a qualitative method with a case study approach. The participants were two physically disabled men who worked at the Warehouse division. Data collection was conducted through in-depth interviews. The study results showed that their work demanded a lot of loading of things that needed to be lifted, high stacking, and increased work if colleagues did not enter shifts. The resilience of disabled people in the workplace is emotion regulation, impulse control, empathy, optimism, causal analysis, self-efficacy, reaching out, and adaptability. Participants demonstrated fairly good resilience skills while at work. This is due to internal factors, including disabled people who have accepted their conditions, have a high sense of gratitude, and are hardworking. External factors included being the breadwinner of the family, difficulty in getting a job, the salary, and there is some social support from family, co-workers, superiors, and the company.
