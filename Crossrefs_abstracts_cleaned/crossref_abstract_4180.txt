Higher seismic performance can be achieved by localizing the inelastic deformation in the connections (fuses) and minimizing the residual drift that are often a determining factor in whether a structure can be repaired or re-occupied after an earthquake. This paper introduces the self-centering damage avoidance steel Moment Resisting Frames (MRFs) using innovative Resilient Slip Friction Joints (RSFJs). The RSFJ provides self-centering and energy dissipation in one compact package requiring no post-event maintenance. In this concept, the beam is connected to the column through a pinned joint at the top, an RSFJ at the bottom and a slotted web plate for transferring the shear forces, when required. The RSFJ allows for gap opening in the connection upon loading and then re-centers the system when unloading. Furthermore, a secondary fuse within the RSFJ is considered to keep maintaining a ductile behavior in the system in case of an earthquake larger than the design earthquake. The conducted experimental tests confirmed the outcomes of this study.
