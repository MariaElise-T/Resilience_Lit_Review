AbstractBackgroundHow psychological resilience influences postoperative outcomes remains poorly characterized. We tested the hypothesis that psychological resilience is associated with lower odds of death or new inability to walk independently and other outcomes at 60 days after hip fracture surgery.MethodsThis was a pre‐planned secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial comparing spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. We analyzed data on 1360 adults aged 50 years or older who were hospitalized for hip fracture surgery at one of 46 US or Canadian hospitals and provided psychological resilience data preoperatively as measured via the Brief Resilience Scale. Major exclusions were the inability to walk without human assistance before fracture and contraindications to spinal anesthesia. Death or new inability to walk independently at 60 days after surgery was the primary outcome; death or new nursing home residence at 60 days and 60‐day mortality were secondary outcomes.ResultsGreater psychological resilience was associated with lower odds of death or new inability to walk at day 60 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.77; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.98; p = 0.03). We observed a similar association between psychological resilience and outcomes among patients who did not experience complications after surgery (aOR 0.72; CI 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.02), but not those who had complications (aOR 1.00; CI 0.59 to 1.69, p = 0.99). Psychological resilience was associated with lower odds of 60‐day death or new nursing home residence (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.93; p < 0.001) but not with 60‐day mortality (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49; p = 0.73).ConclusionsPsychological resilience is associated with better outcomes for older adults after hip fracture surgery, but largely among those who do not have postoperative complications. Future interventions may focus on improving psychological resilience preoperatively or providing support to patients with lower psychological resilience.
