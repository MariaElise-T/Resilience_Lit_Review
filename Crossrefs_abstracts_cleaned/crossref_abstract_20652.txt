BackgroundMental disorders are considered a risk factor for suicide: for example, the lifetime risk of suicide is estimated to be 4%â€“8% in people with mood disorders. The literature suggests that a history of suicide attempts is significantly related to electrodermal hyporeactivity and that patients with violent suicide attempters exhibit faster habituation of the electrodermal response to repeated neutral tones than patients with non-violent attempts. The impact of depressive symptoms on suicidal ideation may be moderated by resilience. Resilience refers to the ability to maintain o regain mental health despite experiencing adversity. In bipolar and depressive disorders, resilience may influence severity of episodes, frequency of relapse and response to treatment.AimThe objective of our study was to assess the possible correlation among attempted suicide, resilience and dermal reactivity in a sample of depressed patients.MethodsWe recruited patients with depressive disorders and bipolar depression; data about socio-demographic, clinical features, severity of attempted suicide and suicidal risk were gathered. Patients filled in the Resilience Scale for Adult (RSA). Moreover, for each patient we performed the Edor test in order to assess dermal reactivity.ResultsData collection is still ongoing. We expect to find lower levels of resilience in those patients who are hyporeactive and attempted suicide. Moreover, we hypothesize that suicide attempts in the group of hyporeactive patients would be characterized by planning and greater severity. Clinical implications will be discussed.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
