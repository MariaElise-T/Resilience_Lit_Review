 This study intends to assess the relationship between resilience in extremely long-lived individuals and sociodemographic, cognitive and health status variables, and significant life events. A selected sample of 48 centenarians (mean age = 100.8 years, SD = 1.2; 83.3% female) from two centenarian studies was considered. A resilience score covering five items (aging and usefulness, hopefulness, worryness, loneliness, and control) was considered. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted in order to identify predictors of resilience. No significant differences in the resilience score regarding sociodemographic variables or typology of significant life events were found. Our findings underscore that health perception (better) and pain (less frequent) were associated with higher levels of resilience. In being present in extremely long-lived individuals, resilience should be object of interest in further research.
