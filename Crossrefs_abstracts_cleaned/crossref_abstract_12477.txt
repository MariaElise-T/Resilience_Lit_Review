In this study, we address the issue of modern practices of human resources management as employee resilience, flexible work and time, social responsibility, which has received a lesser conceptual and empirical attention specifically, from managers perspective.

More importantly, we tried to draw attention to the importance of resilience and flexibility in work, and how they can be combined with other practices of social responsibility, such as transparency and fairness among employee.
