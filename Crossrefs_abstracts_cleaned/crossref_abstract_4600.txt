AbstractWhich of a region's characteristics most strongly influence its degree of resilience? This study constructs a composite resilience index for the Spanish regions and uses Multiple Factor Analysis to compare it with the Martin resilience index (Martin, 2012). The results of a Principal Components Analysis to measure the relative contributions of potential regional resilience drivers indicate that, during recovery periods, it is market‐ service focused regional economies that show stronger resilience, while, in crisis periods, it is regions with a more highly‐educated workforce.
