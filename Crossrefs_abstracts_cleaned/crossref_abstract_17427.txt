 This paper explores resilience in gay and lesbian parent families from a chrono-system perspective, which refers to the development of resilience through time. Resilience is characterised differently by different cultures. In one sub-culture, research on the experiences of children raised in gay or lesbian parent families in South Africa shows that the children often feel vulnerable facing societal heteronormativity), even though gay and lesbian parent families often work diligently to create a sense of belonging within the society in which they live. However, many family studies have either ignored general familial bonding with society or dealt with it only generally. With the significant impact of South African legal transformation over time regarding gay and lesbian parent familiesâ€™ position in society, a chrono-system perspective of factors that influence resilience in gay and lesbian parent families becomes relevant for theory building and psychological support.
