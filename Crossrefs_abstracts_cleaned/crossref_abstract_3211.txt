Transport systems are in a period of a transition. First, there is the urgency to achieve transport decarbonisation and, in general, sustainable mobility (Banister, 2019). In parallel, the events of the last years, especially COVID-19 pandemic, have posed significant challenges on transport systems that are likely to lead to structural changes in transport demand (Das et al., 2021). Besides, technological innovations enabling new Mobility on Demand services and concepts like MaaS (Mobility ad a Service) are also responsible of a restructuring of both transport demand and supply towards personalized and on-demand services (Shaheen and Cohen, 2020, Le Pira et al., 2021). New scenarios for transport systems are therefore needed to reach inclusivity, resilience and sustainability. This is the rational of the special issue that stems from the AIIT 3rd International Conference on Transport Infrastructure and Systems (TIS ROMA 2022), which was held in Rome on 15th-16th September 2022 (https://tisroma.aiit.it/). The conference was organized by AIIT, the Italian Association for Traffic and Transport Engineering, and hosted by ACI, Automobile Club dâ€™Italia.
