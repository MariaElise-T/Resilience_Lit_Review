Resilience is a personal quality that enables a person to develop in adversity. Initially, the concept of resilience was derived from material science. Resilience can also possess organic characteristics, such as cellular resilience. Cellular resilience is their capacity to adapt to environmental changes. Because resilience relates to adaptation and dynamic development, it is more appropriate to describe psychological resilience in terms of organic functions rather than inorganic qualities like material resilience. Cognitive function plays a crucial role in resilience mechanisms. Resilient reintegration is to experience some insight through disruptions, which can occur in meta-level cognitive mechanisms. Metacognition is a conscious process that facilitates cognitive regulation. Metacognition is related to the ability to construct a clear and coherent self-narrative and good psychosocial functioning, which plays an essential role in resilience. Metacognition consists of metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, and metacognitive skills. Learning goal orientation involves metacognitive knowledge as it entails declarative knowledge retained in memory, which includes information about the individual's knowledge of the goals pursued. Self-reflection or introspection is an aspect of a critical-thinking disposition that involves metacognitive experiences that can facilitate the reintegration of resilience. Cognitive flexibility is an individual's awareness of options and alternatives and their belief that they can be flexible, which is related to the metacognitive experience. Problem-solving also involves metacognitive experience, namely the existence of personal control, which explains an individual's ability to control themselves and problem-solving confidence in overcoming problems.
