In this paper, a new precast self-centering rocking shear wall system (PSCRSW) mainly composed of precast reinforced concrete (RC) wall, V-shaped steel brace and pre-pressed disc spring friction damper (PDSFD) are proposed to enhance the seismic resilience of steel moment resisting frame (SMRF). The mechanical behavior of PDSFD was investigated and simulated. The skeleton model of PSCRSW was theoretically derived and numerically validated, and the hysteretic performance under different design parameters was discussed and compared with that of the conventional RC shear wall. Based on the analyses, design principles and suggestions for PSCRSW were given. Then, an efficient seismic resilient design method for enhancement of SMRF was proposed, which considers performance objectives of multiple seismic hazard levels and has less design iteration. A typical SMRF was adopted as the prototype to be enhanced by the presented PSCRSW and design method. Reliable numerical models for the prototype and the enhanced SMRF were established, and nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of enhancing strategy. The results show that PSCRSW can realize approximate yielding behavior, displacement capacity and lateral strength to the conventional shear wall and can significantly lower the residual drift and wall damage. During the design, the ratio of preload to friction force for PSCRSW was suggested to be 1.5~2.0, and the bearing capacity for the wall was suggested to be amplified 1.2 times. Thereby, desirable bearing and self-centering performances can be guaranteed. The presented design method is capable of achieving the inter-story drift ratio targets and the expected roof drift ratios simultaneously, and the seismic resilience of the chosen SMRF was significantly improved by a large margin of reduction in residual inter-story drift and frame member damages.
