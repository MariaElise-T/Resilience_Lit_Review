Nurses should have psychological resilience to have high compassion satisfaction and low burnout and compassion fatigue. The sample comprised 280 hospital nurses in Istanbul. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient. Psychological resilience was positively correlated with compassion satisfaction (
            r
            = 0.372;
            p
            < 0.01) and negatively correlated with burnout (
            r
            = −0.379;
            p
            < 0.01) and compassion fatigue (
            r
            = −0.336;
            p
            < 0.01). Psychological resilience was positively correlated with professional quality of life. Managerial interventions and training should be developed and implemented to help nurses develop psychological resilience to create a positive organizational culture. [
