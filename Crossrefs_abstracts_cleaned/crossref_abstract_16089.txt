Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess burnout, resilience and the association with safety culture in nurses working in mental health institutions in Jazan government Hospital.


Design/methodology/approach
A cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling, with 119 nurses from the Jazan hospital between June and August 2018 was used.


Findings
The results of this study showed that 45.6% of the participants experienced a high level of emotional exhaustion, 36.5% reported a high level of depersonalisation and 15.9% reported high personal achievement. The high level of burnout and its dimensions have a negative effect on patient safety and resilience.


Originality/value
It is particularly important to assess burnout among mental health nurses, resilience and its association with safety culture. Although this study will add to a small body of knowledge, it will also be able to provide policymakers with evidence as how best to reduce burnout among nurses delivering mental health care in Saudi Arabia.
