 Research on challenges in child welfare work can overshadow important strengths and resilience in its workforce. This study presents an analysis of child welfare workers' continued engagement in their work despite high levels of stress, relentless worker turnover, and poor organizational climates. It uses a parallel process, mixed method design to conduct an exploratory study of factors that keep workers engaged in their child welfare jobs. Findings include distinct storylines that center on outcomes for children, change and growth in families, and emotional and pragmatic support from coworkers. Results suggest that efforts to deepen the resilience of frontline caseworkers can build on the strengths they themselves express: their commitment to children and families and their support of each other.
