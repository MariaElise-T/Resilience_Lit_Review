AbstractThe effectiveness of domestic rainwater harvesting (DRWH) systems to support urban flood resilience is analysed at the sub-catchment scale, according to a specific DRWH conversion scenario, under 4 degrees of urbanization, 3 drainage network configurations, 4 precipitation regimes and 3 return periods of the rainfall event. At this aim, a suitable modelling framework is implemented: the semi-distributed hydrologic-hydraulic model is undertaken using EPASWMM 5.1.007 where specific tools are developed to simulate DRWH systems at high spatial resolution. The effectiveness of the DRWH systems simulated for the 144 different cases, is analysed at the event scale by using the Volume and Peak Reduction indexes to measure the hydrologic performance. The dimensionless variable, namely the event storage fraction, is defined in order to easily describe the DRWH effectiveness. The event storage fraction is defined as the ratio between the event runoff volume resulting from the impervious surface of the urban catchment in the reference scenario and the storage capacity of the DRWH systems. Modelling results confirm that DRWH catchment-scale applications allow to support specific stormwater control requirements based on peak-flow or volume regulations strategies. Findings of the elaboration reveal for a typical residential catchment in the Italy-France cross-border coastal area, that DRWH effectiveness in supporting the urban flood management becomes significant (i.e. Volume and Peak Reduction indexes greater than 0.2) starting from a storage event fraction of 0.4 that means realizing storage tanks able to contain at least the 40% of runoff volume generated by the targeted event at the sub-catchment scale.
