Countries, states, and cities around the world are seeking to enhance power sector resilience through a combination of policy and technology. However, few of these efforts fully incorporate the built environment into power sector planning. Buildings account for more than a third of the global annual energy consumption and more than 60% of the annual electricity consumption. As such, buildings play a critical role in enhancing resilience in the power sector. Buildings can aid in power sector resilience by increasing power system flexibility, shaving and shifting demand, and providing on-site energy generation. All of these strategies require incentives to encourage participation. This paper presents an overview of energy management strategies to better incorporate building design and operation in power sector resilience planning.
