AbstractThis paper synthesizes the differences in the predictive power of multidimensional firm characteristics on organizational resilience and further identifies the key characteristics and their specific impact patterns. It is found that the firm's stability during the crisis depends more on the pre‐crisis firm's operating conditions, while the post‐crisis firm's flexibility depends more on the firm's internal and external resources. Besides, some firm characteristics rank higher in predicting the importance of organizational resilience. This study examines organizational resilience characteristics from a more comprehensive perspective and provides empirical evidence on how managers can better respond to systemic crises and enhance organizational resilience.
