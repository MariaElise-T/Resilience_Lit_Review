Previous studies have shown that Childhood Exposure to Domestic Violence (CEDV) has been demonstrated to hold an important role in violent and unethical behaviors. Little is known about the relationship between CEDV and moral disengagement, the role of self-control and resilience. This study investigated whether CEDV has an impact on moral disengagement through the indirect effect of self-control and conditional effect of resilience. This study utilized purposive convenient sampling. The sample consisted of N = 562 (men; n = 273; women; n = 289) with age range between 16 to 25 years (M = 19.27; SD = 2.50). The sample was collected from madaaris, college, and university students from different provinces of Pakistan. The measures used in this study included the Urdu version of CEDV, Moral Disengagement Scale, Corner and Davidson Resilience, and Brief Self-Control Scale. The results indicated that CEDV significantly positively predicted moral disengagement through the indirect effect of self-control. Resilience significantly moderated the association among self-control and moral disengagement whereas the resilience did not significantly moderate the relationship between CEDV and moral disengagement. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed
