Abstract
This reflective piece offers an alternative perspective to understanding the components which support the Palestinian capacity to endure and resist 100 years of violation and injustice, in context. It traces the development of the authorâ€™s understanding over time as part of the Palestinian community living under Israeli military rule in chronic warlike conditions. It combines this lived experience with research results which raise question about what resilience means, the difficulties encountered in its measurement, and the utility of the concept in explaining the Palestinian reality. It emphasizes the need to include the contextual experiences of those who live in wars and conflicts in future research and for knowledge production. It ends by stressing that it is not sufficient to offer humanitarian aid to the victims of wars and conflicts without also advocating for justice not only for Palestinians but also in other contexts of injustice worldwide.
