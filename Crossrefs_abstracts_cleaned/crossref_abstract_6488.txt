 The results of analyses of laboratory resilient modulus testing conducted on dense-graded and open-graded aggregates are presented. The testing program included three different aggregate materials (crushed limestone, natural stone, and slag), five different gradation specifications, and three different moisture conditions (dry, moist, and saturated). In addition to the five aggregate specifications, test specimens were prepared so that they would satisfy the lower, central, and upper bounds for the gradations. Resilient modulus tests were conducted as closely as possible according to Strategic Highway Research Program Protocol P-46 (AASHTO T 294-92 I). The test results were analyzed using log-linear regression analysis with two-parameter (bulk stress) and three-parameter (bulk stress and octahedral shear stress) expressions for resilient modulus. The results of the testing indicate that the resilient modulus of aggregates and regression constants vary significantly depending on the type of material and vary less significantly depending on material gradation and moisture condition. The natural stone aggregates had the higher moduli and the slag aggregate had the lowest moduli. The resilient modulus does not vary significantly as the moisture content increases unless the aggregate becomes saturated. The R2 values are consistently higher using a three-parameter expression than a two-parameter expression.
