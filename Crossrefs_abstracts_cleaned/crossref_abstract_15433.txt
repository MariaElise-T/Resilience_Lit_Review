Psychological outcomes play a vital role in the stress and satisfaction with life (SWL) of people amid novel situations. Set in the context of emergency remote education amid the global COVID-19 crisis, this study was carried out with the overall purpose to assess whether hope and resilience mediate the relationship between stress and SWL of teachers. A survey was conducted in a sample of 2272 teachers from Mindanao, Philippines. Adapted scales were used to gather the needed data through a structured online survey questionnaire. The result of the analysis demonstrated that stress has a significant and negative predictive effect on hope, resilience, and SWL. On the other hand, hope and resilience generated significant and positive predictive effects on SWL. The result of mediation analysis proved that hope and resilience significantly mediated the relationship between stress and SWL. These pieces of evidence suggest that hope and resilience are important psychological resources that can decrease the negative impacts of COVID-19 experiences such as stress on the SWL of the teachers.
