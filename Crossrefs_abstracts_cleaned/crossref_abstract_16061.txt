Informed by family stress and family resilience perspectives, this study examined couplesâ€™ experiences with comorbid chronic illnesses in later life. Using data from semi-structured interviews with 28 couples coping with type 2 diabetes and osteoarthritis, we used a qualitative approach to explore stressors and resilience processes associated with comorbid chronic illnesses. Five types of stressors and four types of resilience processes were reported by couple participants. Various stressor and resilience patterns emerged, depending on comorbid illness severity. Respondents reporting high severity in diabetes and osteoarthritis demonstrated fewer resilience processes than did those whose illnesses were not severe. Although most couples exhibited some resilience processes in response to illness-related stress, resilience processes appeared less often among those with self-ratings of high diabetes and arthritis severity and more often among those whose illnesses were less severe. Future research should address buffers of severe comorbid illnesses in later life.
