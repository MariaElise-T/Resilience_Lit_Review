In this paper, we apply an indicator-based approach to measure the resilience of energy regions in transition to a case study region in Austria. The indicator-based approach allows to determine the resilience of the transition of regional energy systems towards higher shares of renewables and potentially overall higher sustainability. The indicators are based on two core aspects of resilience, diversity and connectivity. Diversity is thereby operationalized by variety, disparity and balance, whereas connectivity is operationalized by average path length, degree centrality and modularity. In order to get a full picture of the resilience of the energy system at stake throughout time, we apply the measures to four distinct moments, situated in the pre-development, take-off, acceleration and stabilization phase of the transition. By contextually and theoretically embedding the insights in the broader transitions context and empirically applying the indicators to a specific case, we derive insights on (1) how to interpret the results in a regional context and (2) how to further develop the indicator-based approach for future applications.
