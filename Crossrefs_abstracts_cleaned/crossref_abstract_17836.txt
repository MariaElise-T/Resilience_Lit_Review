Climate change, characterized by shifts in weather parameters and escalating climate-related risks, has emerged as a global environmental concern. Among these concerns, chronic heat waves have garnered attention due to their far-reaching implications. This study delves into the profound impact of chronic heat waves on the Mpameso forest reserve in Ghana, an ecosystem of vital importance. Chronic heat waves have induced notable changes in the local climate, marked by increased temperatures, elevated evapotranspiration rates, and alterations in rainfall patterns over the past three decades. Ghana, like many regions worldwide, has experienced shifts in seasons and a rising global mean surface temperature, contributing to the intensification of global warming. The repercussions of chronic heat waves are particularly significant within forest reserves, and their effects on Ghana's Dormaa Central Municipality are explored in detail. Vegetation cover in Ghana has faced recurrent challenges from extreme heat waves, leading to diminished forested areas, heightened evapotranspiration rates, and instances of drought-induced water scarcity. To assess the severity of these impacts and devise proactive environmental management strategies, this study leverages the power of satellite remote sensing. Utilizing Landsat imagery, the study examines changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) alongside the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Evapotranspiration (ET) within the Dormaa municipal area. Pearson correlation analysis is employed to uncover the intricate relationship between LST, vegetation health, and ET within the Mpameso forest reserve. The study's compelling findings reveal that chronic heat waves predominantly affect the settlement areas surrounding the forest reserve, sparing the reserve itself from significant LST-related health impacts. This nuanced understanding underscores the importance of proactive conservation efforts and climate resilience planning, emphasizing the value of integrated approaches to safeguarding vital ecosystems in the face of mounting climate extremes.
