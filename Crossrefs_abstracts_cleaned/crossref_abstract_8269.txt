The Covid-19 pandemic has further illuminated the already existing need for methods of building resilience in perinatal caregivers. Using a scoping review approach, literature was examined to identify evidence-based models of resilience building in a cohort of perinatal clinicians. Research published between January 2015 and 2020 was evaluated using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Of the initial 3399 records reviewed, 2 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Given the deleterious effects of Covid-19 on perinatal care providers, and in light of the paucity of available studies, personnel, time, and funding should be allocated for research to address these issues.
