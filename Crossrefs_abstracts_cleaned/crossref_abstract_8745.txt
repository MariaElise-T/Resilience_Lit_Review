 Theoretical substruction is vital in clarifying models and guiding research. In this article, the process of theoretical substruction was examined through resilience theory to provide an example of the congruence between theoretical and operational definitions in nursing research. The author examines the significance of resilience theory in the context of dementia caregivers’ burden and their care recipients’ behavioral problems. The steps of theoretical substruction are included, and a model of resilience is presented that includes middle-range concepts, relational statements, and propositions derived from the research literature. The rigorous process of theoretical substruction provides an example of a theoretically sound basis for exploring the role of positive thinking in the lives of dementia caregivers and their care recipients. Geropsychiatric nurses working with dementia patients and their caregivers should consider the role of positive thinking in decreasing caregivers’ burden.
