This study unveils the effects of stressors on employees' task performance through the mediating role of thriving at work (TAW) and a moderating role of resilience (RES) grounding on conservation of resources (COR) theory. The analysis of collected data from 331 supervisor-employee dyads in the hospitality sector of China explicates that the role conflict (RC) and perceived workload have a negative influence on TAW, and thriving has a positive relationship with task performance. The results corroborate the mediating role of TAW between RC, perceived workload, and task performance. Furthermore, the RES suppressed the negative relationship between RC, perceived workload, and TAW. Moreover, our study underscores the theoretical and practical contributions regarding the negative influence of stressors on TAW by exhibiting the importance of the COR mechanism for employees' behavioral outcomes.
