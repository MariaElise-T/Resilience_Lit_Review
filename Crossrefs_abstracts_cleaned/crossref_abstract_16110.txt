AbstractChildhood experiences can affect individualsâ€™ self-esteem and psychological resilience during personality and psychosocial development in adolescence and adulthood. The effect of positive childhood experiences on adulthood has rarely been investigated, with most studies focusing on negative aspects of childhood. Evidence shows that they also influence the development of psychological resilience and self-esteem. This study examined the relationship between positive childhood experiences, self-esteem, and psychological resilience. A total of 570 university students completed the Positive Childhood Experience Scale, Brief Resilience Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The results of structural equation modelling indicated that positive experiences significantly predicted self-esteem and resilience. Self-esteem also predicted psychological resilience. Most importantly, positive childhood experiences had an indirect effect on resilience through self-esteem. The results suggest that focusing on positive aspects of childhood is as important and functional as dealing with negative ones to contribute to self-esteem and resilience. We suggest that school psychologists and counsellors could integrate these results into intervention programs to improve resilience through increased self-esteem.
