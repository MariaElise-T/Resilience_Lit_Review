This multimodal project, influenced by an Appreciative Inquiry framework, aimed to elicit stories of hope and resilience amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse twenty collected stories. A multimodal method that combined linguistic and visual language (non-fiction comics) was adopted in order to present the research findings. In Elliâ€™s case, as with other participants, engaging with customs and rituals turned out to be an important source of hope, joy and resilience.
