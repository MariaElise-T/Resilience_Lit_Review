Although communication is an important factor constituting community resilience, previous research did not measure the communication factor. This was so because communication was viewed simply as a process of information exchange. In the present study, communication is defined in terms of the relationship to be formed before disaster. A measurement tool consisting of 20 items was developed by reviewing previous studies and analyzing in-depth interviews with experts and the general public. Two surveys were conducted. The results of exploratory factor analysis revealed the following three factors: ‘local government leadership’, ‘efficacy of community members’, and ‘two-way communication’. The discriminative and convergent validity of the measurement tool were confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, the predictive validity was confirmed through the relevance to social support. The community resilience scale developed in this study can be meaningfully used in future research used to recover the community from disasters and to minimize damage.
