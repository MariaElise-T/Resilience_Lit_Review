            Anecdotal evidence suggests nurses are engaging in resilience-based strategies to mitigate increased levels of psychological distress and unmanaged negative emotions they have been experiencing. Nurses' levels of resilience during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have not been clearly articulated, specifically in relation to psychological distress and negative emotions. The purpose of the current mixed-methods non-experimental descriptive study was to examine nurses' resilience during the pandemic. Sixty RNs working in acute care hospitals on inpatient units designated to care for patients with COVID-19 completed the study survey and 20 of these RNs completed an interview. Findings indicate moderate levels of resilience among participants, with the need to increase resources and support emerging as a common theme among the qualitative data. Suggestions for integration of resilience-based strategies into the clinical setting, such as creation of a dedicated space for nurses to engage in mindfulness, relaxation, and meditation, were put forward.
