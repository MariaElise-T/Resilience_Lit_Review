AbstractA unifying framework in defining and measuring resilience has been an intense research topic. In this paper, resilience is measured as a function of intrinsic capacities of a system, the effectiveness of recovery, and the extrinsic random shock process. Some existing resilience measures are analyzed as special cases of the proposed unifying measure. Then, we develop a framework in which the key constituents in achieving resilience are identified. Resilience is represented by four key dimensions: reliability, robustness, recovery, and reconfigurability. Finally, some practical and specific strategies are proposed to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure systems under the proposed framework.
