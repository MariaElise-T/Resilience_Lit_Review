Urban resilience strengthens urban sustainability and leads to sustainable solutions in the process of promoting sustainable development. Paying attention to the benefits of urban resilience to strengthen sustainable urban systems is vital to achieve our desired future. This study aims to identify and classify the key indicators of resilience in Tongdejie, a residential area in Guangzhou, China, as well as to examine and compare these indicators with sustainable development indicators. Fuzzy AHP was used to rank the most important indicators in Tongdejie. The results showed that the first three important indicators were economic indicators, and the economic dimension with a weight of 0.41 was higher than the other four indicators. Then, social and cultural indicators took second place with a weight of 0.194, and the management and institutional indicators took third place with a weight of 0.194. Structuralâ€“physical and environmental dimensions were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively. From the obtained results and their comparison with the sustainable indicators, in addition to ranking the importance of these indicators and incorporating the research related to urban construction development indicators, it can be concluded that these two concepts have a direct relationship with each other. In order to attain a desired and resilient urban future, it is important to pay attention to the indications and advantages of resilience. This leads to the development and stability of urban systems.
