AbstractIntroductionMental health problems as a consequence of cancer lower the quality of life of cancer patients. Despite increasing studies of breast cancer‐focused mobile health applications (m‐Health apps), there is less research on breast cancer patients' quality of life or well‐being. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the usability and quality of an educational m‐Health app aimed at improving the resilience of breast cancer in women.MethodsThis study was conducted in four phases. It included extracting the requirements of the app through the nominal group technique. Based on these results, an m‐Health app was developed and evaluated in terms of usability and quality by two scales, System Usability Scale and Mobile App Rating Scale questionnaires, respectively. Finally, the role of patients' age and educational backgrounds in the use of the app was assessed. The relationship between learnability and usability of the app was measured by the T‐Test.ResultsThe app was developed with three user interfaces. Its usability developed from the patient's point of view scored a remarkable score of 83.20 with a 95% confidence interval. This value was too indicative of high satisfaction with the usefulness and the possibility of recommending it to other cancer survivors. The results of the quality evaluation from an expert's point of view showed that this app had good functionality. Evaluation of the role of demographic information in the use of the app showed that it can be used for all age groups with different levels of education. The app did not differ significantly between learnability and usability.ConclusionThe development of m‐Health apps, based on usability principles that are suitable for all age groups with different levels of education, is welcomed by cancer patients.
