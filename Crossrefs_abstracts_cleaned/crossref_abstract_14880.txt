Resilient suppliers can reduce supply chain risk, effectively avoid supply chain disruption, and bring profits to enterprises. However, there is no united measuring index system to evaluate the resilient supplier under supply chain environment, and the assessment language sets are usually crisp values. Therefore, in order to fill the research gap, this paper proposes a hybrid method, which combines triangular fuzzy number, the best-worst method (BWM), and the modular TOPSIS in random environments for group decision-making (GMo-RTOPSIS) to solve the above problem. Firstly, the weight of decision-maker is calculated by using fuzzy BWM which can deal with triangular fuzzy numbers. Secondly, triangular fuzzy number is introduced into GMo-RTOPSIS, and combined with fuzzy BWM, alternatives are sorted to select the best resilient supply chain partner. Finally, the feasibility and universality of this method are proved by illustrative examples.
