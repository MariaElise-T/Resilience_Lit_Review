Uttarakhand, a critical part of India's Himalayan system, is most vulnerable to climatically mediated risks. Most of the population in this state is based on the agriculture sector for their livelihoods and with continuous rises in global average temperature, those dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods are expected to face changes in local weather patterns beyond their present ability to cope. Therefore, this study is an attempt to understand the issues & challenges facing agriculture due to climate change in the Uttarakhand-A Himalayan State of India and to discuss the measures to develop a climate-resilient and sustainable supply chain for agriculture in the state. This research highlights numerous remarkable innovations in various flows of the supply chain i.e. product flow, information flow, and financial flow with reference to agriculture and allied sector worldwide and particularly in Uttarakhand, which could be replicated on a broader scale to develop and encourage the Uttarakhand agricultural ecosystem.
