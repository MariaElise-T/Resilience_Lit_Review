  	High energy density, improved safety, temperature resilience and sustainability are desirable properties for lithium battery electrolytes, yet these metrics are rarely achieved simultaneously. Inspired by the compositions of clean fire extinguishing agents, we demonstrate inherently safe liquefied gas electrolytes (LGE) based on 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (TFE) and pentafluoroethane (PFE) that maintain > 3 mS cm-1 ionic conductivity from –78 to +80 °C. As a result of beneficial solvation chemistry and a fluorine-rich environment, Li cycling at > 99% Coulombic efficiency for over 200 cycles at 3 mA cm-2 and 3 mAh cm-2 was demonstrated in addition to stable cycling of Li/NMC622 full batteries from –60 to +55 °C. Additionally, we demonstrate that the vapor pressure-temperature relationship unique to LGE systems allows for a one-step solvent recycling process, which promises sustainable operation at scale. This work provides a route to sustainable, temperature resilient lithium metal batteries with fire-extinguishing properties that maintain state-of-the-art electrochemical performance.
