 One’s attachment style forms early in life and can aid in dealing with future setbacks. Equally, Coping and resilience are two specific psychological mechanisms that form how one deals with problems and recovers from stressful situations. These three concepts are well-known interrelated concepts within psychology but to what extent they overlap is still unclear. The present study investigated attachment, resiliency and coping using structural equation modeling. Participants ( N = 390), aged between 9 and 12 y old, completed an paper survey including Experiences in Close Relationship-Revised questionnaire (ECR-RC-12), Resiliency Scales for Children & Adolescents (RSCA), and the Brief-CPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced). Path analysis revealed strong associations between attachment and resiliency as well as strong associations between resiliency and coping. Specifically, the predictive value of anxious attachment on resiliency was seen for all three resiliency sub-scales. However, the predictive value of avoidance attachment on resiliency was only revealed for two of the resiliency sub-scales. The two resiliency protective factors (sense of mastery and sense of relatedness) have a positive predictive value for three coping strategies. Equally, the resiliency risk factor (emotional reactivity) also positively predicted two coping strategies. The current findings demonstrate clear associations between these three concepts. Equally, the theoretical connections are discussed in light of these findings. Equally, stemming from this study, clinical implications are discussed that can inform practice in terms of approaching psychopathologies from different angles (resilience, coping, and attachment) as well as, the development of coping and resilience skills in order to support healthy development.
