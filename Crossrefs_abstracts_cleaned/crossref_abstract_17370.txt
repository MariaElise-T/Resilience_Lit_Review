Groundwater in Pekalongan City suffered vulnerability. Water catchment quality in there is already at a critical threshold. The anthropogenic and natural factors which have fluctuating rainfall stressed groundwater. There are 4580 companies, 33 accommodation services, and 318 restaurants that exert clean water for their performance. The population of Pekalongan city in 2019 has reached 307,097 people, which has increased by almost 25% of the inhabitants in 1993. The local Health Department reported that there was an increase in the morbidity rate of 27.62% compared to 2018. The increase in flooding and land subsidence had triggered a diminish in land value and engender other economic losses. This study executed with a comprehensive literature review of (1)groundwater characteristics, (2)techniques for enhancing groundwater potential, and (3)alternatives of groundwater preservation that proper it. The assessment approach leads to accelerated groundwater infiltration through cutting material with low permeability by crossing less conductive aquifer layers through the installation infrastructure with large diameters. The unit provides the ability to carry out lateral infiltration and increase water storage in the soil to support sustainability and resilience.
