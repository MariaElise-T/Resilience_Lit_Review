            The process of determining the physical locations of nodes in a wireless sensor network is known as
            localization
            . Self-localization is critical for large-scale sensor networks, because manual or assisted localization is often impractical due to time requirements, economic constraints, or inherent limitations of the deployment scenarios. We propose scalable solutions for reliably localizing wireless sensor networks in environments conducive to several types of ranging errors. We follow a hybrid hardware-software approach for acoustic ranging or radio interferometry to acquire internode distance measurements, and a resilient self-localization algorithm to compute the node location estimates. The acoustic ranging method improves on previous work, extending the practical measurement range up to 35 m in grassy outdoor environments, achieving a distance-invariant median measurement error of about 1% (33 cm). The localization algorithm is based on
            least-squares scaling
            with soft constraints. Empirical evaluation using ranging results obtained from sensor network field experiments and simulations confirms that our approach is more resilient than multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithms against large-magnitude ranging errors and sparse range measurements: conditions that are common in large-scale outdoor sensor network deployments.
