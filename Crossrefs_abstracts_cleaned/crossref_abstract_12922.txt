Background: Nursing is a profession where staff are exposed to chronic stress. Mental resilience plays a significant role in the process of coping with these challenges. The aim of this study was to assess nurses’ mental and physical wellbeing, as well as resilience, by taking into account the occurrence of risky behaviour among nurses in Poland. Methods: A descriptive study was carried out between June 2017 and May 2018 among nurses (n = 1080) employed in primary healthcare or in training centres in Silesia, Poland. Data were obtained from a number of questionnaires. Results: Over half of the nurses (n = 735; 68%) had an average psychophysical mood level resulting from stress, and 179 (16.6%) nurses had a low psychophysical mood. Those with a lower psychophysical mood showed a greater tendency towards developing improper eating habits (r = −0.23; p < 0.001). Most nurses had an average (n = 649; 60.1%) or low (n = 255; 23.6%) level of resilience. Higher resilience levels were observed in nurses aged over 30 years (p = 0.004) and in those with additional employment (p = 0.008). High resilience was associated with a lower intensity of risky behaviour. Conclusion: Most nurses in Poland display average and low levels of resilience, which can have unfavourable consequences for their health.
