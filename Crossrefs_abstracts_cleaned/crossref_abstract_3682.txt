The goal of the paper is to offer a review of the current business models, which can jointly highlight a profile, both of adherence to the concepts of “sustainable development” and of resilience to the critical variables (new and systemic), characterizing the present economic crisis also resulting from the pandemic emergency. After a brief historical reconstruction on the concept of “globalization”, the initial part of the paper tries to identify a business paradigm – the “hybrid company” – oriented towards the concept of “sustainable development”. The final part of the study offers a driver identification process of the “resilient company”, closely related to the concept of “business hybrid” (previously declined).
