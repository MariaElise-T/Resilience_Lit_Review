With this article the authors would like to deepen the resilience and psychomotricity as action strategies in preschool education. They analyse too the importance of resilience and psychomotricity and their impact in the learning of disadvantaged children at a preschool age that are exposed to adverse social and personal factors and to assess the efficiency of an intervention program based in psychomotricity and resilience together. The authors developed a project in a region of Brazil (Botucatu), where a Psychological Development Activation Model was used with psychomotricity exercises and also the Programme Strong Start Pre K, in the area of resilience. The assessment instruments used were the WeBeST test for resilience and the Operational Portage Inventory test for Psychomotricity. The results indicate that there was an evolution in resilience among children in the group that participate in this program. They improved the resilience capacity, dealing with problems and controlling the emotions.
