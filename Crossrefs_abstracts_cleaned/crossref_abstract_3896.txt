This paper investigates the concept of resilience at personal, organisational   and   industry   levels. The pandemic has made people feel vulnerable, out of control and repressed. Some industries have thrived and others haemorrhaged, needing to pivot and adapt to survive. Australia’s geographic isolation has acted as a buffer and a point of differentiation from many other countries but did not provide    immunity. Individuals have emerged from the COVID-19 with a different mindset, changed expectations about what they want from work and a different outlook to life generally. Workplaces continue to be disrupted as worker sickness rates escalate, a phenomenon dubbed ‘quiet quitting’ takes hold as workers prioritise other parts of their life and the ‘Great Resignation’ decimates the intellectual and social capital within some teams and organisations. To keep staff, companies need to adapt as workers have now placed a higher level of importance on their health and wellbeing and are looking for a sense of meaning in what they do as well as ways to feel connected and that they are giving back and multiple   disciplines   and   argues that resilience at all levels, across disciplines and industries is required to thrive in the future. An industry- based model for sustainability- innovation-resilience is examined to help industries respond to megatrends and future pandemics. Within this model, industries are   called   upon to enliven their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and career development for staff to support staff wellbeing, providing a path forward to a healthier approach to work and wellbeing.
