Medical practice demonstrated that subjects who inherited normal genes can maintain a healthy schedule throughout
life expectancy and vigorously ensure their physical and mental resilience as a shield against infectious diseases.
Resilience is based on macro biophysical neurophysiological parameters comparing healthy homeostasis, to address
specific external means of maintaining normal neuronal loop (NNLA) activity, providing synchronized body operating
ranges (BOR) with four daytime and four nighttim sleep phases. The NNLA protects the movement of biochemicals and
others, including fluids in BOR that synchronize daytime rest alertness, with minimal, moderate, and maximum physical
or mental load and slow down BOR speeds during sleep stages I, II, III, and IV. These BOR phases are fed from
external physical information units in a stable dynamic homeostatic margin range that we refer to as transient
homeostatic synchronization (THR) mode. THR is synonymous with resilience and reversal within the internal organism
driven by objective obtained from a macro biophysical neurophysiological objective data and subjectively the person
feels his relaxed body rewards him with pleasant biological emotion and cognitive well-being. Subjects who have
inherited or acquired abnormal genes have been linked in action to abnormal neuronal loop operation (ANLO) that
causes chronic distress at different levels of intensity, we call transient homeostatic desynchronized (THD) condition
with accelerated BOR and causes hypersensitivity or slowing of BOR to be hyposensitive. It provides a single or mixed
DSM IV disorder. The purpose of this paper is twofold, treating resilience as internal homeostasis on the one hand and
replacing THD with macro biophysical neurophysiological informative therapy (MBNIT) that drive the BOR given to
a resilient version of THR or to a flexible healthy state on the other.
