 South Carolina has one of the fastest-growing Hispanic/Latino populations in the United States, and the majority of the immigrants are of Mexican descent. Historically, most of these immigrants were young men, but in recent years, more women and children have moved from Mexico to South Carolina and other parts of the Southeast. The study presented here investigated the lives of 20 undocumented Mexican women in South Carolina using a grounded theory approach. It found that undocumented women from Mexico have mustered a tremendous amount of strength and resilience in overcoming the cultural, social, economic, and legal barriers of living in the United States. The findings suggest that more research is necessary on the resilience and assets that undocumented women from Mexico bring to the United States.
