Flood resilience is an emerging concept for tackling extreme weathers and minimizing the associated adverse impacts. There is a significant knowledge gap in the study of resilience concepts, assessment frameworks and measures, and management strategies. This editorial introduces the latest advances in flood risk and resilience management, which are published in 11 papers in the Special Issue. A synthesis of these papers is provided in the following themes: hazard and risk analysis, flood behaviour analysis, assessment frameworks and metrics, and intervention strategies. The contributions are discussed in the broader context of the field of flood risk and resilience management and future research directions are identified for sustainable flood management.
