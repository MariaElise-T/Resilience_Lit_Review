Climate change is one of the most extreme challenges Indian agriculture is facing today and will have to deal with in future. There have been overwhelming and growing scientific evidences to establish that the world is getting warmer due to climate change and such increasing weather variability and worsening extremes will impact the agriculture sector more and more adversely. The sheer scale of involvement of the poor in agriculture calls for an effort to meet the challenge of climate change head-on through resilience building measures that work through a system of adaptive and mitigation strategies. Considering that new approaches are needed, development and deployment of new technologies, advocacy and capacity building have an extremely important role to play not only to build farmerâ€™s capability but to help in changing the mind-set as well. Both short term and long terms outputs are expected from the project in terms of new and improved varieties of crops, management practices that help in adaptation and mitigation and inputs for policy making to mainstream climate resilient agriculture in the developmental planning. The overall expected outcome is enhanced resilience of agricultural production to climate variability in vulnerable regions.
