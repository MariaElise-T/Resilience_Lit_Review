Resilience is a widespread concept and a
key priority for the EU. We focus on resilience’s relations with stability. These
notions have been subject to ongoing theoretical debate and have not been
clearly separated in EU discourses. We explore how resilience and stability
have been used regarding the Southern and Eastern dimensions of the European Neighbourhood
Policy (ENP) and suggest how their different meanings may be better distinguished
and conceptualised. Resilience has penetrated the ENP’s discourses unevenly and
attracted the limited interest of the neighbours. Besides, the EU’s policies
will likely face numerous practical problems mostly similar to the ENP’s both
dimensions. The EU’s policies themselves have disturbed stability in its neighbourhood,
and now, even restoring the old stability would be problematic, let alone
attaining a more positive one. Furthermore, the EU could impose its views
regarding stability and/or resilience. Also, Brussels could de facto uphold
negative stability and/or resilience.
