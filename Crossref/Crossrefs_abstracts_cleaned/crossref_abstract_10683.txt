This paper proposes a practical and effective planning approach that takes advantage of the mobility and flexibility of mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) to increase distribution system resilience against complete area blackouts. MESSs will be very useful for boosting the system’s resilience in places affected by disasters when the transmission lines are damaged. A joint post-disaster restoration strategy for MESSs and PEV-PLs is proposed, along with distributed generation and network reconfigurations, to reduce total system costs, which include customer interruption costs, generation costs, and MESS operation and transportation costs. The integrated strategy accounts for the uncertainty of the production of wind- and solar-powered microgrids (MGs) and different forms of load demand. Therefore, this paper assesses the effect of MESSs on distribution system (DS) resilience in respect of MG cost reduction and flexibility. Due to the multiple networks, PEV-PLs, DGs, and MESS limitations, the suggested restoration problem is stated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The suggested framework is complemented using a benchmark testing system (i.e., 33-bus DS). To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, the model’s output is contrasted with results from typical planning and a traditional model. The comparison of the data shows that the suggested model, in addition to MESSs, effectively achieves a large decrease in cost and enhances the DS resilience level.
