Background: Organizational culture is the most essential tool of an organization to increase the resilience of personnel in a healthcare system. Promoting organizational culture is an effective factor in increasing job satisfaction and reducing psychological burden, and burnout in nurses. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the influence of organizational culture on resilience by mediatory effects of occupational stress, job satisfaction, and burnout in nurses using structural equation modeling. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 712 nurses working in seven hospitals in Tehran during the 2018 - 2019. The participants were selected by thee stratified random sampling method with proportional allocation. In detail, after determining the number of samples of each hospital, sampling was performed using a random number sequence. The data gathering was performed by using questionnaires. Data were analyzed by the SPSS, version 23.0, and LISREL, version 8.8. Results: We found a significant positive correlation between organizational culture and job satisfaction (r = 0.29) and resilience (r = 0.21) (P < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between organizational culture and occupational stress (r = -0.22), and burnout (r= -0.14) (P < 0.05). The goodness of fit index (GFI) for organizational culture, occupational stress, job satisfaction, burnout, and resilience was 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, 0.96, and 0.95, respectively. RMSEA index for organizational culture, job satisfaction, burnout, and resilience was 0.069, 0.093, 0.057, and 0.050, respectively, which showed that the model is appropriately fit. Conclusions: The findings of the present study indicated that promoting organizational culture and reducing occupational stress and burnout can improve job satisfaction and mental health in nurses.
