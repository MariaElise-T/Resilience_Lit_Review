            The purpose of the current study was to identify characteristics of resilience using surveys in 50 bereaved caregivers for persons with dementia who lost their care recipient in the past 6 months. Surveys were reviewed and sorted as demonstrating a resilient grieving process or a problematic grieving process.
            Resilience
            was defined as the ability to adapt in a positive direction, with adequate support resources in place despite destabilizing experiences. Following initial review and sorting, 19 resilient surveys were coded and grouped according to phrases. Using the qualitative descriptive analysis process, five themes of resilience were derived from these surveys. Themes of resilience included:
            Relationships, Spirituality, Formal Support, Honor,
            and
            Relief
            . The use of these themes was noted to be supportive of a positive grief experience. The information provided in the current study serves to inform clinical nurses on resilient attributes to support bereaved caregivers for persons with dementia to improve grief outcomes. [
