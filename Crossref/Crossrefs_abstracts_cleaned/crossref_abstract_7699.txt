PurposeThe purpose of the study is to determine and prioritize the resilient capability factors at different stages of supply chain disruptions in Pakistan's textile industry.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs a two-stage methodology. In the first stage, the extant literature was reviewed, and based on that, experts' panel consultations were conducted to identify the resilient capability factors at the different stages of supply chain. In the second stage, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology was used to rank the resilient capability factors needed in Pakistan's textile industry.FindingsThe results show that building an integrated supply chain ranking is one of the most critical practices in bolstering supply chain resilience. The results also reveal that firms should focus on the readiness phase of resilience as it is categorized as the most important phase.Practical implicationsThe findings of the study provide supply chain professionals with a clear consideration of the critical factors that are needed to build supply chain resilience. From an industry-specific perspective, the study offers guidelines on what resilient capability factors should be regarded as critical when implementing resilient capabilities in order to reduce the negative impacts of disruptions.Originality/valueThe study is among the first studies in prioritizing the resilient capability factors at different phases of supply chain disruptions. The study would provide further opportunities for future researchers in using other multicriteria decision-making tools.
