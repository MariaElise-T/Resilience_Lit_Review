AbstractCambodia has experienced urban growth since the early 2000s, not only in the capital but also in its secondary cities. Like other cities in Southeast Asia, conflict over land use, pressure on infrastructure, ecological changes, and competing interests over these resources among dominant groups have been contentious. This paper uses a Battambang secondary town as a case study. The town has experienced the colonial legacy, is rich with natural resources and is part of the regional economic corridor route development. Recent changes have drawn much attention to the need to formalize a spatial plan, promoting community‐led urban development, low‐cost housing and equitable land sharing, and networking among urban poor as a shared learning process. Urban resilience has been tested, as the city has had to cope with increased flooding and stress on its infrastructure, processes that involve government agencies, donors, NGOs and local residents. Based on a policy review, semi‐structured interviews with key informants, and extensive participant observation, this study argues that while promoting the formalization of land use and resilience, there is an institutional trap being manipulated by emerging strategic groups, associated with dominant political working groups and embedded culture of local elites. Local knowledge has been adopted by certain groups, known as “subordinate,” in demanding social justice, equity distribution and promoting shared learning among social groups at the communities. Resistance and spreading negative rumours against dominant groups are seen as strategies to increase social resilience and develop flexible institutions.
