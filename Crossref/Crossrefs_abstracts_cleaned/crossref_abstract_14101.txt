AbstractBased on six waves of longitudinal data collected from high school students, the study examined developmental pattern and correlates of resilience in adolescents in Hong Kong. Over 6 years, the students were invited to complete a questionnaire containing measures of psychosocial functioning including family functioning, parent-child subsystem quality and resilience. There was a slight decrease of resilience throughout adolescence. Adolescents having better parent-child subsystem quality and family functioning reported higher levels of resilience initially. However, better mother-child subsystem quality and family functioning were significantly associated with faster decrease in resilience, although adolescents with better parent-child subsystem quality and family functioning always reported higher resilience levels over 6 years. The findings suggest that strengthening family processes can help to promote resilience in adolescents in Hong Kong.
