Background. Physician burnout is a growing problem worldwide. Several interventions aimed at lowering burnout rates among physicians have been implemented. To date, there is no established structured program to combat burnout in the Philippine General Hospital. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the I-CARE program, a physician resilience and wellness program which adapted the different components of the international programs for the Philippine setting.
Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of the I-CARE program in reducing medical residents’ burnout level.
Methods. After key components of the I-CARE program were identified, the program was implemented in 2 phases. The first phase involved training of consultants to hone their facilitation skills. The second phase was a before-and-after study of the I-CARE program. The participants’ burnout level was measured before and after the program using the Maslach Burnout Inventory.
Results. The I-CARE program was implemented in the Department of Pediatrics from March to August 2020. There was no significant change in the overall burnout levels of 59 pediatric residents after the I-CARE implementation (p=0.32). This may be due to several challenges encountered during the implementation, such as time constraints, the increased workload caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lack of physical meetings due to the restrictions of the pandemic. However, the feedback of the administrators, facilitators and residents was generally positive. All the interviewed participants recommended the continuation of the I-CARE program in the Department of Pediatrics.
Conclusion. The I-CARE program shows potential in promoting mental health and emotional wellness among physicians in training.
