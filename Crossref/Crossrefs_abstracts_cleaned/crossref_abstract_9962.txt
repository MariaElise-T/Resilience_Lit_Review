The Resilient Cities Network initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation advocates achieving the goal of comprehensive resilient urban development through land-use planning, but the implementation of resilience must be achieved through a vulnerability analysis. The Lowry Model is the earliest and most used land-use integrated transportation allocation model. Its operation is mainly based on accessibility indicators to allocate population and employment opportunities, and the results of the allocation can be used as a basis for urban development. Accessibility is a unique feature of the Lowry Model, in which accessibility is a function of employment opportunities and physical distance. However, it builds non-resilient cities. A city is a system that is vulnerable and suffers the most when change occurs. A city with a high density of population, although it has location convenience, is relatively vulnerable to disasters and security threats. Ignoring resilience makes the city lose its adjustment mechanism to avoid disasters and make the city less resilient, less safe, and even less efficient. This paper takes Taoyuan City, Taiwan, as the case study area, uses the data to implement a resilience-oriented allocation of land use, and compares the results with a non-resilient land-use allocation. The results show that the resilience-oriented Lowry Type Model can indeed allocate population and service employment opportunities to districts with higher resilience and lower vulnerability, can meet the threshold standard constraints of the economies of scale, and can obeythe population density scale constraints to maintain an adequate level of quality of life. This paper offers positive conclusions that can support the application of the resilience-oriented Lowry Type Model to Taiwan and even other cities that expect resilient planning.
