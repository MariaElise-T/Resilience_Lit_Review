Abstract One of the major impacts caused by large dams is induced displacement, which is associated to several social and ecological negative secondary effects. This studyâ€™s objective is to analyze how the resettlement process engendered by the Barra Grande hydropower plant reorganized the local social-ecological system, affecting its resilience. The study is based on the social-ecological systems framework. Quantitative data was collected in official sources and field interviews were conduced. Collected data was analyzed in order to verify if disturbances drove the system towards more or less resilient pathways. Findings reveal that the resettlement process has benefitted the uniformity of agricultural practices and has encouraged farmers to control the system ecological conditions, negatively affecting the resilience of the social-ecological system.
