Climate-change-related events are increasing the costs of power outages, including losses of product, revenue, and productivity. Given the increase in meteorological disasters in recent years related to climate change effects, the number of costly blackouts, from an economic perspective, has increased in a directly proportional manner. As a result, there is increasing interest in the use of alternators to supply dependable, instantaneous, and uninterruptible electricity. Traditional research has focused on the installation of diesel backup systems to ensure power requirements without deeply considering the resilience capabilities of systems, which is the ability of a system to recover or survive adversity, such as a power outage. This research presents a novel approach focusing on the resiliency impact of backup systemsâ€™ storage-free dispatchable solutions on buildings and compares the advantages and disadvantages of biomethane microturbines, natural gas engines, and diesel engines backup systems, discussing the revenue resulting from the resilience provided by emergency generators. The results show that, for several diesel fuel and natural gas safety assumptions, natural gas alternators have a lower probability of failure at the time of a blackout than diesel generators, and therefore, resilience increases.
