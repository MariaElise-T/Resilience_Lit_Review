 This article reports a study on the impact of two continuing education programs for pastors working in prisons and correctional settings. Pastors who did the spirituality refresher training sessions reported greater resilience and social entrepreneurship inclinations posttest compared to those who did the expressive writing sessions. Male pastors, with a postgraduate degree and chaplaincy-focused training, prison pastors, ever-singles, pastors living in religious institutions/seminaries, and with higher intervention compliance, reported higher benefits from spirituality refresher training.
