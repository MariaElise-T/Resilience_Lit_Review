Watersheds have a significant role to play in safeguarding ecosystem services against climate changes and extreme weather events. Thus, these protected areas are widely susceptible to such risks which will significantly affect human communities. This paper is an exploratory study conducted to assess the resilience of CALSANAG Balogo sub-watershed using the estimated Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CliDRI) and capital-based approach. The study used the five resilience-based dimensions; namely: the physical, social, economic, institutional, and natural in the survey conducted in which a total of 35 randomly selected respondents residing in Brgy. Balogo, Calatrava, Romblon were interviewed for the study. The questionnaire covered the five resilience-based dimensions and the 23 indicators selected base don the local context to gain an understanding of the level of resilience of its ecosystem. Results showed that Balogo exhibits above average resilience accumulating a score of 0.58 on a scale of 0-1. The resilience scores varied from 0.43 (average resilience) to 0.80 (high resilience). On the average, resilience levels in the community showed high levels in socila dimension and low levels in the economic dimension. An analysis of the index values were also provided along with the suggested feasible policy recommendations that the community leaders, policymakers, and stakeholders can implement to improve climate and disaster resilience of Balogo.
