The purpose of this study is to suggest a community disaster resilience model to become a sustainable society in the era of climate crisis. The climate crisis not only has a direct impact on human life, but also has a wide and severe impact on various environments surrounding humans. In fact, all spheres that make up or surround a community are affected. For example, all areas such as politics, economy, society, culture, nature, science and technology, medical health, military, and safety of a country or region are being forced to change by the climate crisis. If we refuse to change due to the climate crisis or do not accept a new paradigm, the very survival of human society will be threatened. In order to secure community disaster resilience, it is necessary to improve resilience at individual, community, and environmental levels. Efforts should be made to improve good health (psychological & physical health), quality familyship, and financial stability at the individual level. At the community level, economic growth, social capital, and cultural inclusion, and at the environmental level, infrastructure recovery, government function, and nature restoration.
