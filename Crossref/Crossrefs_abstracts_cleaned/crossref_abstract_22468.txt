AbstractBackground and AimsThe decision to stay in nursing has been challenged by the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. New nurses joined the workforce and provided care to patients with COVID‐19 although they received limited training, which could have influenced their intention to stay in nursing. We aimed in this study to examine the impact of caring for patients with COVID‐19 on career decisions, resilience, and perceived self‐efficacy among newly hired nurses in Jordan. It also tested the predictors of intentions to stay among new nurses.MethodsThis cross‐sectional quantitative study was conducted using an online electronic questionnaire form. The sample included newly hired nurses (n = 300) working in public hospitals and providing care to patients with COVID‐19 in different levels of acuity units. The perceived stress scale and Connor−Davidson resilience scale 25 were used to measure stress and resilience among nurses.ResultsThe majority chose nursing as their career, but they were not satisfied with the current work conditions or autonomy in decision‐making. Many nurses reported having moderate to high work‐related stress and low to moderate resilience. Among all variables in this study, financial income predicted mild intention to stay in nursing.ConclusionsNurses expressed the presence of work‐related stress and low to moderate levels of resilience. As new nurses, exposure to these stress levels might lead to burnout. Nursing managers should take necessary measures to promote better work conditions and improve resilience to avoid nurses leaving the profession at times when there is a shortage.
