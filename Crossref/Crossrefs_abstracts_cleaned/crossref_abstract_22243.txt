AbstractThis article describes a participatory geographical information system (PGIS) demonstration project used as part of the stakeholder engagement efforts undertaken by the Citizen Engagement Working Group of the Hampton Roads Sea Level Rise Preparedness and Resilience
 Intergovernmental Planning Pilot Project. The PGIS demonstration project was conducted in the Little Creek/Pretty Lake case study area in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern coastal Virginia. PGIS served as a deliberative and participatory mechanism to obtain local knowledge from residents
 about the location of valued assets within the community and locations challenged by increased flooding and sea level rise. The PGIS application, using the weTable tool, was found to be useful for soliciting and documenting local knowledge, such as by highlighting community assets and identifying
 community challenges. It was also found to be useful for facilitating community-wide discussion, visualizing the problem, and understanding the severity of sea level rise and flooding. The PGIS demonstration project showed how participatory mapping can directly engage residents in creating
 sociospatial data, build knowledge, and foster learning and deliberation in a complex issue such as resilience to flooding and sea level rise.
