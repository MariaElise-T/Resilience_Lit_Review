The aim of this paper is to present the relevant information and development available in the scientific literature regarding the seismic behavior of micropiles (MPs) and micropiled structures (MPed). The seismic behavior of MPs is not very well studied, but MPs are used in retrofitting of old buildings and for new resilient buildings, and in terms of seismic behavior they have a high potential. Additionally, their association with seismic dampers for improving the seismic behavior of buildings is not yet fully studied and it represents a major topic of interest for both new structures and historical monuments. After the introductory part, the paper describes all relevant information regarding MPs, as types and technology, seismic behavior, applications for increasing seismic resilience, and experimental and numerical modeling.
