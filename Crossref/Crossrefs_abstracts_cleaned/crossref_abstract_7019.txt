Over the past 18 months of the COVID‐19 pandemic, references to the concept of resilience have circulated ubiquitously throughout social media, talk shows, podcasts, and a variety of web‐based platforms. We are reminded that resilience can be learned, and “listicles” offer tips to strengthen our resilience and our children's resilience. One such piece recommends that readers can help their children build resilience by modeling their own through taking deep breaths in difficult situations. These casual recommendations promote a narrative in which resilience is reduced to a muscle that simply needs to be exercised. An unintended consequence of such recommendations is that they may also communicate an underlying expectation on the individual and the family, echoing the creep of terms like wellness and self‐care, which have shifted from practices promoting health and well‐being, to another item on a never‐ending to‐do list. For kids and families struggling through the uncertainties and turmoil of the pandemic, this can be perceived as a lightly veiled reminder to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
