Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper is to integrate resilience, robustness, and resplendence (R
3) with sustainable enterprise excellence (SEE) and social-ecological innovation (SEI) that assist firms to progress toward continuously relevant performance proceeding from continuously responsible strategy, behavior, and other actions. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – Sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience, robustness, and resplendence (SEER3) model and the associated means of SEER
3 maturity assessment are introduced to explain the organizational concept. 


Findings
 – SEER3 balances the complementary and competing interests of key stakeholder segments, including society and the natural environment and increases the likelihood of superior and sustainable competitive positioning and hence long-term enterprise success that is defined by continuously relevant and responsible governance, strategy, actions, and performance consistent with high-level organizational R3. 


Originality/value
 – This paper adapts the established principles from physics to characterize enterprise R3 to come up with SEE model.
