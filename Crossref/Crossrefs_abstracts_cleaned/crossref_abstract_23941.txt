 This study has built a modified gravity model to quantify the connection strength between villages, and complex networks were used to analyze and deconstruct the resilience characteristics of network structure and simulated resilience change characteristics under different scenarios including climate change, and identified the network core of the villages. The improvement of the resilience levels of rural systems under changing environments is an important sustainable development. The objective of this study is to provide a basis for the construction of rural emergency disaster prevention in flood storage areas and provide a reference for sustainable rural low-carbon development of village system. The results show that (1) from the perspective of spatial patterns of rural networks, there are obvious spatial differences in Mengwa rural network, showing a spindle-shaped spatial structure with dense middle and sparse on both sides. (2) From the perspective of structural resilience characteristics, the network has significant hierarchy and agglomeration, high local transmission and no obvious characteristics of homogeneity or heterogeneity. Amongst them, the core node has a prominent position, strong control ability and significant correlation effect. (3) The results of scenario simulations on rural network resilience show deliberate disturbance can significantly reduce network resilience compared with random disturbance. A large number of high-energy consumption and low-efficiency phenomena occur earlier in the network, leading to the collapse of the network.
