AbstractSchool principals are integral to the success of school operations, particularly in the face of diverse challenges. Resilience emerges as a critical attribute for these educational leaders. This research investigated the sequential mediation effects of imagination and perceived hope on the relationship between savoring and resilience. A survey was conducted with 1306 principals (390 females and 916 males; 302 from senior high schools, 351 from junior high schools, and 653 from elementary schools), representing 34% of the total population. Utilizing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, the analysis revealed that: (1) savoring positively correlates with resilience, (2) imagination significantly mediates the relationship between savoring and resilience, (3) perceived hope significantly mediates the relationship between savoring and resilience, and (4) imagination and perceived hope sequentially mediate the relationship between savoring and resilience. The research concludes by discussing the theoretical and educational implications of these findings and proposes directions for future research.
