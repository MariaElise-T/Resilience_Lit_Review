AbstractObjectiveChronic stress promotes obesity and metabolic comorbidities. The ability of individuals to cope with stress may serve as an important parameter in the development of obesity‐related metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study was to clarify whether differences in stress response affect metabolic health under obesity.MethodsThe study was performed in a selectively bred mouse model of social dominance (Dom) and submissiveness (Sub), which exhibit stress resilience or vulnerability, respectively. Mice were given a high‐fat diet (HFD) or standard diet, followed by physiological, histological, and molecular analyses.ResultsThe HFD caused hyperleptinemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, steatosis of the liver and pancreas, and brown adipose tissue whitening in Sub mice, whereas Dom mice were protected from these consequences of the HFD. The HFD increased circulating levels of interleukin (IL)‐1β and induced the expression of proinflammatory genes in the liver and in epididymal white adipose tissue of Sub mice, with no changes in Dom mice. The Cox2 inhibitor celecoxib (15 mg/kg/d) reduced serum IL‐1β, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and prevented hepatic and brown adipose tissue whitening in HFD‐fed Sub mice.ConclusionsThe extent of stress resiliency is associated with inflammation and contributes to population heterogeneity in the development of healthy or unhealthy obesity.image
