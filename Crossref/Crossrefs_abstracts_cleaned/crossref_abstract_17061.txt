To realize low-carbon energy systems, distributed energy storage systems and flexible loads have been integrated into power grids. System reliability, economy, and resilience, therefore, face significant challenges. This article presents modeling of a distributed energy micro-grid including wind turbines, micro gas turbines, waste heat recovery devices, electric boilers, direct-fired boilers, battery energy storage, interruptible loads, and transferable loads. At the same time, the optimal configuration of energy storage and the demand-side response modeling are studied, and the combined optimization control strategy of the two is demonstrated. The simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy has better performance than the traditional operation. In addition, this article also clarifies the impact of control strategy on distribution system resilience. The results show that the control strategy proposed in this article can achieve the resource complementarity of demand-side response and energy storage, and realize the integrated coordination of source, network, load, and storage. The distributed energy micro-grid under this control strategy has the best overall economic benefit and the best capacity to accommodate load growth.
