AbstractIn this person-centered study, we identified different profiles of resilience and vulnerability in emerging adulthood in response to previously experienced stressful life events. Additionally, we examined whether mothers’ and fathers’ parenting and participants’ personality traits in adolescence predicted these profiles. Data from the Flemish Study on Parenting, Personality, and Development (N= 346 families) were used. At T1 (2004;Mage= 11 years), T2 (2007), and T3 (2009), mothers and fathers reported on their parenting and their child’s personality. At T4 (2018;Mage= 25 years), emerging adults retrospectively self-reported the occurrence and impact of 22 stressful life events and rated current behavior problems and subjective well-being. Latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: Competent (71%; low stress, low behavior problems, high subjective well-being), Vulnerable (21%; average stress, high behavior problems, low subjective well-being), and Resilient (9%; high stress, average behavior problems, average subjective well-being). Emerging adults in the Resilient profile had experienced higher levels of maternal positive parenting and were less emotionally stable and conscientious than those in the Competent profile. Furthermore, emerging adults in the Vulnerable profile were less emotionally stable than their peers in the Competent profile. These findings reveal new insights into the heterogeneous patterns of emerging adults’ adaptation following stressful life events.
