Suppliers can be regarded as unavoidable sources of external risks in modern supply chains, which may cause disruption of supply chains. A resilient supplier usually has a high adaptive ability to reduce the vulnerability against disruptions and recover from disruption to keep continuity in operations. This paper develops an effective multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) framework for resilient supplier selection. Because of the many uncertainties in resilient supplier selection, the dual hesitant fuzzy soft sets (DHFSSs), a very flexible tool to express uncertain and complex information of decision-makers, is utilized to cope with it. In order to obtain the resilient supplierâ€™s partial order relationship and consider the psychological behavior of decision-makers, this paper proposes the MAGDM framework with DHFSSs based on the TOPSIS method and prospect theory for resilient supplier selection. Furthermore, we consider the consensus level among experts of different backgrounds and experiences and propose a consensus measure method based dual hesitant fuzzy soft numbers (DHFSNs) before selecting a resilient supplier. The expert weights are calculated by the group consensus level between the expert and the group opinions. Meanwhile, we define the entropy of DHFSSs to determine the attribute weights objectively in the decision-making process. Based on this, the proposed method is applied to a practical manufacturing enterprise with an international supply chain for a resilient supplier selection problem. Finally, by performing a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis, the results demonstrate the robustness and validity of the proposed method.
