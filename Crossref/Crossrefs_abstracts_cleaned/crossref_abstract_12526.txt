The paper presents the methodological work behind production of the UNICEF Remote Learning Readiness Index, a composite indicator to assess the resilience of education sector against crises and emergencies. The index is composed of demand-side factors, such as readiness for remote learning observed at the household level, supply-side factors that are approximated by the education policy response of the governments to the COVID-19 outbreak, and systemic factors that refer to the overall preparedness of education sector to crises and emergencies. The major novelty of the adopted methodological approach to measure how national education systems can ensure every child learns refers to the emphasis put by the index on the weakest parts of the system. The adopted “weakest link” approach allows the index to guide policy-making and be sensitive to a country improvement in time. The work also accentuates the importance of the index application beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as disruptions to education supply are not unique to the current health crisis and can happen due to the conflicts, natural or men-made disasters, or other factors.
