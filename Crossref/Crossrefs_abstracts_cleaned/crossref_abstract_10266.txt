AbstractThe ongoing pandemic has evolved and is posing diverse challenges for the world. Countermeasures for risks are needed to address both direct and indirect effects of disease on the healthcare system, economic and industrial sectors, governance, environment, transportation, energy, and communication systems. There are indicators of a forthcoming postpandemic era. The rethinking and reevaluation of policies adopted throughout the pandemic are ongoing to address cascading threats of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. The first Special Issue introduced the topic. This second Special Issue describes international collaboration and innovation for pandemic risk and resilience, with a focus on future policy and operations of global systems toward a postandemic era.
