ObjectiveThe interaction of poverty and climate‐related crisis, along with socio‐ecological determinants of poor nutrition, could become major factors negatively affecting food and nutrition security (FNS). Therefore, it is important to identify resilience factors to enrich FNS. This study aimed at the identification of resilience factors (RF) as contributors to food and nutrition security in 3 communities from the municipality of Santa Catarina Mita, Department of Jutiapa, Guatemala.Methods: We assessed food and nutrition security with direct interviews, with a food security (FS) scale and with anthropometry in 184 families from the communities of La Barranca, El Quebracho y La Javia, from the southern department of Jutiapa.Results: A total of 590 subjects, mean age of 31y with 0‐99y as range, were recruited from the selected households (hholds). FS was present in 24% of hholds. RF associated with less vs. more malnutrition in preschool age children included hholds with cement floor, using a sewer system, availability of rice, eggs and leafy leaves and head of hhold not working in agriculture. For mothers, RF for less vs. more overweight and obesity included education, not buying sweet drinks, drinking water from the public system and head of hholds growing corn and beans as cash crops.ConclusionsOnly one‐quarter of families evaluated were food secure. Contrasting them against those food insecure, we identified resilience factors to avoid malnutrition in preschoolers and to control overweight/obesity among mothers. The identification of RF for sustainable FNS and for promoting health could contribute to solutions for the socio‐economic development of rural communities.
