 The pitfalls inherent in the indiscriminate application of artificial neural networks to numerical modeling problems are illustrated. An example is used of an apparently successful (but ultimately unsuccessful) attempt at training a neural network constitutive model for computing the resilient modulus of gravels as a function of stress state and various material properties. Issues such as the quantity and quality of data needed to successfully train a neural network are explored, and the importance of an independent test set to verify network performance is examined.
