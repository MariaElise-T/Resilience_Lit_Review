Metro station restoration sequence optimization is crucial during post-disaster recovery. Taking both budget limitations and repair time uncertainty into account, this paper proposes a resilience-based optimization model for choosing an optimal restoration sequence scheme, maximizing the global average efficiency, under the condition that the network accessibility meets given resilience requirements. Evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II is applied to solve the model. A Case study in Nanjing and Zhengzhou gives insights into restoration sequence strategies for decision-makers. Results show that a ring network is more robust than a radial network under the same scale attack. Under limited budget, the optimal restoration sequence is closely related to the damaged stations’ location and repair time. Specifically, if damaged stations’ distribution is relatively centralized and transfer stations need more repair time, giving repair priority to transfer stations is not always the best strategy. If damaged stations’ distribution is relatively scattered and all stations’ repair time is the same, the station with a bigger node degree should be repaired earlier. However, this conclusion may be invalid if transfer stations repair time is far longer than others. Sensitivity analysis show that the total budget is more sensitive than one day’s budget in the entire restoration phase. However, in the emergency phase, increasing one day’s budget is more significant for shortening recovery time. The proposed model can contribute to effective and flexible decision-making for metro network restorations.
