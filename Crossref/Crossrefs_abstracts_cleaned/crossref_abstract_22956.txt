 Resilience is an important concept to determine how well a Dutch Emergency Response Safety Region behaves under stress. The main objective of this study is to determine the intrinsic value of “resilience” for Dutch Emergency Response Safety Regions. In this study it is concluded that the concept of “resilience” can be best described by the generic approach “operational resilience”. A large scale survey among safety stakeholders in The Netherlands was conducted where the following items describing operational resilience were explored: situation awareness ( awa); management of keystone vulnerabilities ( kv); adaptive capacity ( ac) and quality ( q). Results show resilience of an emergency response organization can be described by a unique dynamic operational resilience f( Rero) UV factor. A simplified approach of unique dynamic operational resilience is suggested by using a quick scan method to speed up the process of assessment.
