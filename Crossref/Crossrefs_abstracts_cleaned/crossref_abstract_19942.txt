BACKGROUND: Although college life can be fulfilling, it can be stressful, particularly for health professional students. In addition, they may have had Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) that increases their sensitivity to academic stress. Yet, students need to overcome challenges to become successful professionals. The literature suggests the following factors may be associated with resilience: ACE and academic stress as the antecedents; ego-resilience, emotion regulation, resources, social support, inflammatory markers, and genes as the defining attributes; and mental health and sense of coherence (SOC) as the consequences. AIMS: The purpose is to identify the relationships among factors associated with resilience using network analysis. METHODS: A total of 70 college students participated in this cross-sectional pilot study. They completed measures of psychosocial variables and provided saliva samples, which were analyzed for Serotonin Transporter-Linked Promoter Region (5-HTTLPR)/rs25531 and inflammatory markers. Mixed graphical models including all variables were estimated using the R-package mgm. RESULTS: Network analysis revealed positive associations between (1) mental health and SOC; (2) mental health and resources; (3) mental health and social support; (4) SOC and reappraisal of emotion regulation; (5) resources and reappraisal of emotion regulation; and (6) resources and social support. In addition, SOC and academic stress were negatively associated. Furthermore, the short variant of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 was associated with stronger suppression of emotion regulation and fewer resources compared with the long variant. CONCLUSION: Resilience may be influenced by biopsychosocial factors, notably SOC and 5-HTTLPR/rs25531. However, longitudinal research is needed with a larger sample size to better understand how these and other factors may affect resilience.
