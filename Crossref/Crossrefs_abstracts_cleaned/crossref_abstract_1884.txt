Resilience, the capacity to recover from a setback or adversity, is a concept that has received considerable recent attention. An individualâ€™s resilience predicts their life trajectory following stressful events and this has increasingly been shown in a wide variety of applications. Our understanding of the degree to which we can modify our resilience, and the optimal means to do so, remains in its infancy. The US military has embraced extensive efforts to quantify and build resilience in service members in an effort to preserve the fighting force. We specifically look at the understanding of resilience as it relates to the athletes in terms of competition and return from injury. This article explores the concept of resilience, the efforts to build resilience, lessons learned from the military and applications of the resilience concept to surgical and trauma patients.
