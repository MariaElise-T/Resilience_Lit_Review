The research shared in this article seeks an understanding of Indigenous resilience within the context of a culturally responsive land-based initiative, Project George, led by the Moose Cree First Nation, also known as the Omushkego people. The initiative centres core Cree values, community engagement, and land-based skills to ensure the well-being of youth. Their Homeland is located in the waterways and on the western shores of the Hudson and James Bay Lowlands in Ontario, Canada. The methodology involved researcher participation and engagement as part of a 4-month field presence; informal conversations and visiting; as well as formal semistructured interviews with community members over 4 years from 2012 to 2015. The research explores the benefits and challenges of a land-based program by highlighting the experiences and voices of community and program participants who directly engaged with Project George. The findings show that land-based learning initiatives inspired and driven by Indigenous people foster a regenerative approach to wellness based on relation to land, culture, and identity. A return to land-based learning responds to the ongoing colonial complexities affecting the health and wellness of Indigenous youth in Canada and draws strength from the peopleâ€™s resilient practices.
