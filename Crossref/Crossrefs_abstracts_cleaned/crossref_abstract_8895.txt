Symptoms of depression have become more visible due to the lack of social support among people during the period of the pandemic. The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between depression, social support and resilience among university students in Haryana during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 100 university students living in Haryana participated in this web-based survey. A standardized e- questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and a link was shared through social mediaâ€”WhatsApp and Facebook etc. The results show that more social support is associated with less depressive symptoms and more resilience ability in students.
