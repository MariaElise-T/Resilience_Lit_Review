Objectives  The purpose of this study is to examine ow the job environment, job stress, and resilience level of childcare teachers affect the burnout of childcare teachers in direct or indirect routes.
Methods  To this end, data were collected by 227 childcare teachers working at daycare centers located across the country and a survey. SPSS 22.0 program were used to find out the relationship among the variables. The cor-relation analysis, multiple regression analysis and verification of mediating effect were used.
Results  The burnout of childcare teachers showed a significant negative correlation with job environment, resil-ience, and a significant positive correlation with job stress. Job stress had a effect on burnout. The job environ-ment and job stress of childcare teachers had a indirect effect on burnout through resilience.
Conclusions  It was found that as childcare teachers positively perceived the job environment and received less job stress, resilience increased and burnout decreased. The results of this study can be utilized as a theoretical basis for teacher education, confirming the significance of multifaceted approaches to prevent burnout and pro-mote resilience among childcare teachers.
