 The concept of self-centering structure and replaceable structural member or fuse is a new approach of earthquake resilient structural design. The new structural system is not only capable of preventing from failure of the structure and life safety of the occupants during earthquakes, but also quickly restoring its basic function in a short time following earthquakes. Restoring the original position through self-weight or pre-stressing forces, this kind of structures is defined as a rocking or self-centering structure. The replaceable elements of the other new kind of structural system, which includes coupling beams, energy dissipation devices, and rubber bearings and so on, are designed to be inelastic or failure, like a fuse, and to protect the main structure from damage in the region of high seismicity. The authors of this paper will report three different tests on new earthquake resilient structures, which are shaking table tests on a self-centering RC frame, quasi-static cyclic tests on RC wall with replaceable coupling beams and the ones with replaceable foot parts. All of the three new kind structural systems present an efficient resilient ability under severe horizontal forces in the tests.
