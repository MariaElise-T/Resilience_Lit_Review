Resilient silicone-matrix composites containing 7–13 volume percent nickel filaments (0.4 μm diameter) exhibited 74–93 dB electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness at 1–2 GHz and 1 × 10−1 – 2 × 10−2 Ω cm DC volume electrical resistivity. The high shielding effectiveness is due to the small diameter of the nickel filaments. The composites are useful for EMI shielding gaskets and cable jackets.
