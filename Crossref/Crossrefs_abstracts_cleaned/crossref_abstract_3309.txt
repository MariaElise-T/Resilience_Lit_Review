Human gut microbial communities are subject to numerous perturbations, including dietary changes, exposures to antibiotics and toxins, and pathogen infection. We are developing genetic tools to identify and characterize the mechanisms these microbes use to persist in the perturbed gut environment. Our results suggest that single genes can determine the resilience of commensal bacteria during inflammation. Such factors may provide important insights into the dynamics of recurrent pathogen infection and efforts to introduce stable beneficial microbes into the gut.
