 In recent years, the activity of protecting against and planning responses to the wide range of security challenges that threaten cities and urban areas—from natural disasters such as flooding and anthropogenic climate change to crime and terrorism—has been referred to as ‘urban resilience’. In this sense, urban resilience refers to both the design alterations (structural, architectural, land-use planning) and managerial and governance measures that seek to prevent or mitigate the physical and social vulnerability of areas, ultimately to protect life, property and economic activity. Against this background, this paper analyses attempts to embed physical and managerial resilience in urban areas to counter the risk from terrorist attacks. Specifically, it highlights the expanded role for the spatial planning system in meeting and mediating pressures for increased safety and security. Drawing on historical examples, but paying particular attention to the current UK context, the paper details how the planning profession is becoming more responsible for counter-terrorism; this is leading not only to requirements for further training but also to concerns regarding efficacy. This work also questions how proportionate the pressures to achieve counter-terrorism resilience are, particularly given the higher likely incidence and impact of natural disasters.
