This study aims to obtain a model that represents the Effect of Maritime Culture and State Policy on Maritime National Security and measures how much it affects. The relationship model is needed as a guideline in formulating marine policies based on the strength of Maritime Culture that has taken root in the history of the Indonesian nation. The method used in this study is to use the SEM (Structural Equation Model) Modeling approach which is compiled based on quantitative descriptive analysis with the aim of describing relationships between variables accompanied by significant indicators. Modeling analysis has a significant relationship between Maritime Culture (X1), State Policy (Y1) and National Maritime Security (Y4). The variable indicators used are community character (X1.1) and economic activity (X1.2), cultural activities and happiness traditions (X1.3), defense and security policies (Y1.1), economic policy (Y1.2) , Technology and education policy (Y1.3) and Socio-cultural Policy (Y1.4). National Resilience with indicators: ideological aspects (Y4.1), politics (Y4.2), economics (Y4.3), socio-cultural (Y4.4) and defense security (Y4.5). The study produced a Model with Goodnes of Fit value in the form of a suitability of the model that represented a significant relationship between Maritime Culture and State Policy towards National Resilience. The relationship formulations found were: Maritime Resilience = 0.207 * Maritime Culture, State Policy = 0.542 * Maritime Culture, Maritime National Defense = 0.813 * State Policy and Maritime National Resilience = 0.813 * State Policy + 0.207 * Maritime Culture.
