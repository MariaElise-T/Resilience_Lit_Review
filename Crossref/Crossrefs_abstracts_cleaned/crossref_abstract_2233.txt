In this paper, insights are provided into how senior managers can establish a global cyber security model that raises cyber security awareness among staff in a partnership arrangement and ensures that cyber attacks are anticipated and dealt with in real time. We deployed a qualitative research strategy that involved a group interview involving cyber security and intelligence experts. The coding approach was used to identify the themes in the data and, in addition, a number of categories and subcategories were identified. The mind map approach was utilized to identify the thought processes of senior managers in relation to ensuring that the cyber security management process is effective. The global cyber security model can be used by senior managers to establish a framework for dealing with a range of cyber security attacks, as well as to upgrade the cyber security skill and knowledge base of individuals. In order for a cyber security mentality to be established, senior managers need to ensure that staff are focused on organizational vulnerability and resilience, there is an open and transparent communication process in place, and staff are committed to sharing cyber security knowledge. By placing cyber security within the context of a partnership arrangement, senior managers can adopt a collectivist approach to cyber security and benefit from the knowledge of external experts.
