BACKGROUND: People experience higher levels of psychological distress during times of crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Resilience is a psychological resource that helps people to recover from adverse events. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resilience on COVID-19-related stress and worry about job loss in people with chronic conditions and disabilities (PwCID). METHODS: The Perceived Stress Questionnaire -8 (PSQ-8) and the Brief Resilience Scale were used to measure COVID-19-related stress and resilience, respectively. Demographics were also assessed. A two-step hierarchical regression and binary regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A moderate amount of perceived stress and resilience with mean scores of 2.45 (SD = 0.69; range 1-4) and 3.17 (SD = 0.98; range 1-5), respectively, were found among the 269 participants. Resilience (β=-0.44, p < 0.001) was significantly associated with COVID-19-related stress after controlling for demographic variables. Results also revealed that those with higher resilience scores had lower probability to worry about job loss. CONCLUSION: PwCID who have higher scores on resilience reported lower levels of COVID-19-related stress. Resilience can be cultivated among PwCID for better psychological outcomes during times of crisis. Vocational rehabilitation counselors can implement strategies to improve resilience in PwCID.
