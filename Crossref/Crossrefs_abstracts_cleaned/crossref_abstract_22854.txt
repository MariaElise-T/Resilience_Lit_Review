Objectives  The purpose of this study was to investigate whether occupational stress, self-esteem, and resilience of public hospital nurses have an impact on their intention to turnover.
Methods  A structured questionnaire was administered to 240 nurses who had worked for more than 3 months in three public hospitals in Jeollabuk-do from August 22nd to September 4th, 2022. The questionnaire measured occupational stress, self-esteem, resilience, and turnover intention. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 software to fulfill the research objectives, including frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, Independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Scheff√© test, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, and hierarchical regression analysis as appropriate.
Results  Regarding nurses' turnover intention, the study finds that occupational stress has a positive impact, while resilience has a negative impact. These two factors collectively explain 24% of the variance in turnover intention.
Conclusions  It can be observed that in the clinical setting of public hospitals, reducing occupational stress and en-hancing nurses' resilience are pressing tasks to diminish turnover intention. Simultaneously devising practical measures for this purpose and implementing them in the practical field emerge as imperative challenges.
