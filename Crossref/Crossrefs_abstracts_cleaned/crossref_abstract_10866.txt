With the rapid development of the social economy, environmental and resource constraints of economic growth are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, for cities, we should take the road of green development and sustainable development. On the one hand, we should fully implement the basic policies issued by the central government. On the other hand, we should fully integrate the actual situation of the city to make it better implemented, which will help to improve the ability of ecological environment governance and consolidate the ecological advantages of the city. With the development of the urban economy and the continuous increase of population, the development pressure faced by cities is also increasing. Innovating urban construction mode has increasingly become the focus of the development of the new era. The main reason is that the continuous growth of the urban population, environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and ecological damage has caused great trouble to urban residents. The traditional public service governance model has been unable to meet the current public service needs of urban residents. Based on this background, major cities around the world have begun to study urban resilience in order to prevent and resist the interference and impact brought by the outside world and maintain the sound development of the urban system. Based on the demand for ecological environment governance, this study analyzes the current situation and causes of urban ecological environment governance in China and the problems existing in urban resilient transportation construction in China, and puts forward corresponding countermeasures for ecological environment governance and the current situation of urban resilient public transportation construction. This study has great theoretical and practical significance to promote the sustainable development of the Chinese ecological environment and the resilience construction of urban transportation.
