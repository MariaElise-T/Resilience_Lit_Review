As a result of dynamic political, economic, socio-cultural and technological changes, modern man lives in a world of constant progress and development. New possibilities and technologies of today's civilization, on the one hand, make life easier for an individual in almost every area of its functioning. On the other hand, they may pose a threat to its development. Clinical observations and empirical reports indicate that the percentage of children and adolescents with various difficulties and psychological disorders is increasing. The article is a review and refers to two reflections. The first one concerns the factors that pose a threat to the mental health of today's children and adolescents. The second one results from the assumptions of health psychology (health promotion and positive prevention) and concerns the role of adults in shaping and strengthening the health of the young generation in the face of contemporary challenges. The aim of the article is, on the one hand, to draw attention to the disturbing contemporary trends, which, in the face of psychological knowledge, can be considered risk factors that may contribute to the increase in disorders in the group of children and adolescents and, on the other hand, to draw attention to the need to shape and strengthen the psychological resilience of the young generation by the impact of the communities closest to them â€“ parents and teachers.
