The ability of forages to quickly resume aboveground growth after grazing is a trait that enables farmers to better manage their livestock for maximum profitability. Leaf removal impairs root growth. As a consequence of a deficient root system, shoot re-growth is inhibited leading to poor pasture performance. Despite the importance of roots for forage productivity, they have not been considered as breeding targets for improving grazing resilience due in large part to the lack of knowledge on the relationship between roots and aboveground biomass re-growth. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is extensively used as forage source in temperate climates worldwide. Here, we investigated the impact of leaf clipping on specific root traits, and how these influence shoot re-growth in two winter wheat cultivars (i.e., Duster and Cheyenne) with contrasting root and shoot biomass. We found that root growth angle and post-embryonic root growth in both cultivars are strongly influenced by defoliation. We discovered that Duster, which had less post-embryonic roots before defoliation, reestablished its root system faster after leaf cutting compared with Cheyenne, which had a more extensive pre-defoliation post-embryonic root system. Rapid resumption of root growth in Duster after leaf clipping was associated with faster aboveground biomass re-growth even after shoot overcutting. Taken together, our results suggest that lower investments in the production of post-embryonic roots presents an important ideotype to consider when breeding for shoot re-growth vigor in dual purpose wheat.
