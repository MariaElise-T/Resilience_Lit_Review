Background: The increasing mental health problems of Indian adolescents are of great concern but child-health mental service is in a nascent stage. Anxiety is the most common psychological problem found in school-going children. The psychological intervention for this high-risk population at an early stage of adolescence can prevent mental health problems. Aim: The study aimed to assess the applicability and effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on resilience and anxiety of early school-going adolescents with anxiety. Method: This study used pre, post, and follow-up with a randomized control group design. Out of 200 samples screened by Preliminary Identification Performa and Clinical Interview Schedule (PI&CI), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), Spence Childrenâ€™s Anxiety Scale (SCAS), and Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS-C), 72 samples aged between 10 to 14 were included in the final study and grouped into two equal groups through a simple randomized method. Psychological intervention based on mindfulness (PIBM) group with N = 36 received 12 sessions of mindfulness-based intervention (MBCT-C) but only 33 completed up to follow-up. Only N = 32 in Treatment Waiting List (TWL) group completed three assessments who received parental counseling about anxiety. The outcome measures were Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), SCAS, Bharathiar University Resilience Scale (BURS). Result: The findings suggested that the PIBM group significantly improved in mindfulness and resilience, and anxiety symptoms were reduced. The effect size observed is strong and the post hoc t-test showed significant change in variables in every assessment duration. The TWL group did not have significant change. Thus MBCT-C is an applicable and effective intervention for a early school-going adolescent with anxiety.
