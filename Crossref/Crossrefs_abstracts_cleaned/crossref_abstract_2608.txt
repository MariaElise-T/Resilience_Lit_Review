This paper highlights the subgrade resilient modulus (MR), which is recognized as an important parameter to characterize the stiffness of the subgrade soil for designing flexible pavement. In this study, 18 thin-walled Shelby tube samples of fine-grained subgrade soils were collected from two sites in South Carolina (Laurens/SC-72 and Pickens/SC-93) and tested in the laboratory using AASHTO T307-99 to obtain the MR. In addition, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed on the same pavement sections to obtain the back-calculated MR(FWD) per the AASHTOWare 2017 back-calculation tool. A subgrade MR catalog was established and used to select hierarchical Input Level 2 for Pavement Mechanistic-Empirical design (PMED) analysis (v 2.6.1). The PMED analysis was run for 20 years. The Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) and global calibration values were used to predict asphalt concrete (AC) pavement distresses (e.g., rutting, bottom-up fatigue, top-down fatigue, and transverse cracking) and International Roughness Index (IRI) for each pavement section. The predicted values were compared to the field-measured values to determine bias and the standard error of the estimate to validate each distress prediction model for local calibration.
