AbstractAlthough previous studies have investigated pre-competition anxiety (PCA), the research examining how to promote the development of self-reflection and resilience in order to regulate PCA is limited. This study has three aims: to examine group differences age, gender, sport level, and exercise duration in (PCA), self-reflection and resilience; to test the relationships between PCA, self-reflection, and resilience; and to determine whether self-reflection and resilience can predict PCA. The included 82 male and 105 female adolescent Chinese table tennis player (ages 12â€“19). SPSS 25.0 software has used to drive ANOVA, Pearson correlations and regression analysis. The main result was that Pearson correlations demonstrated the strongest relationship between PCA, self-reflection, and resilience. The regression analysis model proved that self-insight predicted cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety and self-confidence; interpersonal assistance and emotional control predicted self-confidence; and emotional control predicted cognitive anxiety and somatic anxiety. The result of this study were consistent with those of previous studies: there was a significant relationship between PCA, self-reflection and resilience when using the Chinese Adolescent Resilience Scale, and there were some differences in the test of group differences. However, this study uncovered new evidence that interpersonal assistance and emotional control can predict PCA. Further research should focus on cross-cultural differences in the process of cultivating athlete self-reflection and resilience.
