Abstract

Objectives
Identifying the factors associated with HRQoL in adolescents is a prerequisite of interventions aimed at improving the overall quality of life and health status among them. Studies have identified many factors associated with HRQoL in different populations; however, very little is known about the role of resilience on HRQoL in adolescent students.


Subjects
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1500 high school students (750 boys and 750 girls) in Tehran. The subjects were selected through the cluster and multistage sampling methods.


Methods
The data collection tool included three questionnaires; a demographic information questionnaire, the Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (KIDSCREEN-27), and the Children and Youth Resilience Measurement (CYRM-28). Data were analyzed with SPSS 23 software. Regression analysis was performed to determine the association of resilience with HRQoL.


Results
The mean score of overall health-related quality of life and overall resilience were 57.51 ± 15.03 and 98.35 ± 16.48, respectively. Individual sub-scale (β = 0.402, p < 0.001), caregiver sub-scale (β = 0.279, p < 0.001) and context sub-scale (β = 0.122, p < 0.001) of resilience were, respectively, the positive and significant predictors of HRQoL in students. The resilience sub-scales explained 49% of the total variance of HRQoL, and the individual sub-scale was the strongest predictive factor for HRQoL in students.


Conclusion
It is recommended to incorporate resilience training programs into the regular school education in order to improve the quality of life and health of students in all high schools and educational centers of the country.
