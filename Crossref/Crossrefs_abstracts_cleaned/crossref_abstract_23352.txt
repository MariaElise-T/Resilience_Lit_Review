During the health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most affected sectors was the healthcare workers (HCWs), since it is a population group with a high risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, or depression. Resilience is one of the abilities that can favor a greater adaptation to adverse circumstances. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to know the association between resilience and PTSD in HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak, which contributes to the development of preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions for this debilitating mental disorder. The study was prospective ex post facto, cross-sectional; it had a non-probabilistic sample of 613 Mexican HCWs. Data was collected through the platform www.personalcovid.com. The results obtained showed that resilience is negatively related to PTSD, with nurses being the most at-risk group among HCWs.
