Transplantation is a life-saving intervention for both children and adults, providing survivors with the possibility of a „new” life. During a strictly regulated procedure, patients reach transplantation, and the subsequent recovery phase also takes place according to the path determined by the medical protocol. Psychological changes are by no means this predictable and planned. After a life-saving operation, both the child and the family must accept the status of a chronic patient in parallel with the recovery. The aim of the research, which started in the fall of 2020, is to identify the psychological characteristics of transplanted children and adolescents with focus being on resilience potential. The data of 51 transplanted children and age- and sex-matched control subjects treated at the Pediatric Clinic of Semmelweis University are processed in the pilot study. Based on our primary results, it can be concluded that there is no significant difference between the groups in terms of resilience, but it should be noted that the resilience value of the transplanted group is at the lower limit. Transplanted adolescents are more characterized by maladaptive coping strategies, lack of prosocial behavior and higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. The resilience value of the transplanted group is in the normal range, which is encouraging for the future regarding management of changes. The results provide guidelines for psychological support designed for transplanted adolescents and for the consideration of resilience-based screening.
