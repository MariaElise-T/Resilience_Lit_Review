During the last weeks of September and the beginning of October 2017, local and international media outlets tracked the weather as Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands were hit by not one, but two of the strongest hurricanes the Atlantic has ever seen. First, Hurricane Irma hit the east side of Puerto Rico, including the island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra. Then, seven days later, Hurricane Maria made landfall, leaving devastation not just in the buildings, but in the hearts and lives of residents of Puerto Rico and of the diaspora of Puerto Ricans who have made their homes across the mainland United States. In the face of this devastation, what is most remarkable is the way that in the face of the worst of nature and weather, we somehow observe the best of people: resilience.
