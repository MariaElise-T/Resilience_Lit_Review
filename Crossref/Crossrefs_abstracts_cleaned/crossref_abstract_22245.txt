The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the boss's genuine leadership perceived by the members of the organization affects organizational commitment through resilience. After conducting a survey of 313 office workers working in this study, the collected data were analyzed using SPS 27.0 and AMOS 27.0. The results of this study are as follows. Self-awareness, balanced information processing, internalized moral perspective, and relational transparency, which are four subfactors of genuine leadership, were statistically significant to all three subfactors of organizational commitment, and positivity and sociality, which are subfactors of resilience, were found to affect emotional, normative, and continuous factors of organizational commitment, but did not affect the control of resilience and continuous factors of organizational commitment. The four subfactors of the boss's genuine leadership, the positivity of resilience, and sociality were affected. In other words, in order to increase the genuine leadership of the boss and the organizational commitment of the members of the organization, the results suggest that various support systems are needed in the direction of increasing their resilience. This study suggests that in order to survive in a rapidly changing era, changes must be made from within the company, and that leaders must create an environment in a good atmosphere with a sincere attitude as leaders and pay a lot of attention to human management in order to improve their members' organizational commitment.
