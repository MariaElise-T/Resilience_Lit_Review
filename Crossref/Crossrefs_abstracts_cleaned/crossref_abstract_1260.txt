This study describes a practical methodology for a resilient planning and routing of power distribution networks considering real scenarios based on georeferenced data. Customers’ demand and their location are the basis for distribution transformer allocation considering the minimal construction costs and reduction of utility’s budget. MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) techniques are implemented to determine the optimal location of distribution transformers and Medium voltage network routing. Additionally, the allocation of tie points is determined to minimise the total load shedding when unusual and extreme events are faced by the distribution grid, improving reliability and resilience reducing downtime during those events. The proposed methodology provides a coverage of 100%, supplying electricity to the totality of customers within statutory limits during normal and unusual conditions.
