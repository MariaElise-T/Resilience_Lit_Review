 Extant literature links higher levels of resilience to overall well-being; however, the underlying mechanisms explaining this relation are unclear. Replicating and extending the study of Mak, Ng, and Wong, the present study investigated the “positive cognitive triad” of hope, world-view, and self-esteem as a possible mediator between resilience and well-being for the first time in an American sample. Participants ( n = 198) completed online surveys of self-esteem, hope, view of the world, and resilience. Consistent with expectations, the triad was a significant mediator of the relation between resilience and well-being. These findings underscore the importance of developing interventions targeting the positive cognitive triad and examining the triad within the context of mental illness. Limitations and areas for future research are discussed.
