This cross-sectional study aims to examine factors related to nurse resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic. Data was collected in early 2020 around January - June from 39,605 South Sulawesi nurses spread across 24 districts which we grouped into 4 main areas (Bugis, Makassar, Mandar, Toraja). The questionnaire included the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS10), demographics and 20 questions about the practice environment, workplace safety regarding infection control, Covid-19-related experiences and organizational support. The fear of being infected, the desire to leave nursing, and having undergone a positive Covid-19 test are inversely proportional to resilience (p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that rural nurses) had much greater resilience than urban nurses examined (p < 0.001). Organizational support, which involves nurses in policy development, and practice was found to be an important resilience factor in our study, which is in line with other findings. Further research is recommended to determine the optimal practice environment to support nurse resilience.
