Abstract
Attitude assessment is one of important things that can help teacher to know how the development of students attitude in learning process. This study aims to present the implementation of attitude assessment by mathematics teacher at school. This study was qualitative descriptive research. The data were collected by using observation and conducting an interview to one of teachers of 8th grade in Cimahi. The result shows that the teacher was still difficult to implement attitude assesment. It caused the teacher had some obstacles in developing attitude rubric. In the end, students had negative attitude toward mathematics in classroom. To cope with this problem, the teacher needs to establish their own mathematical resilience so that they can have values, struggles, and growths that can help them in developing the attitude rubric. At the end of this article, it is also presented the contributions of mathematical resilience to develop rubric of attitude assessment in mathematics learning.
