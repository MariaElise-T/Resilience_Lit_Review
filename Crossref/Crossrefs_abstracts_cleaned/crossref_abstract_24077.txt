AbstractThe objective of this study was to characterize frailty and resilience in people evaluated for Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), in relation to quality of life (QoL) and Intrinsic Capacity (IC). This cross-sectional, observational, study included consecutive people previously hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia attending Modena (Italy) PACS Clinic from July 2020 to April 2021. Four frailty-resilience phenotypes were built: “fit/resilient”, “fit/non-resilient”, “frail/resilient” and “frail/non-resilient”. Frailty and resilience were defined according to frailty phenotype and Connor Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC-25) respectively. Study outcomes were: QoL assessed by means of Symptoms Short form health survey (SF-36) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and IC by means of a dedicated questionnaire. Their predictors including frailty-resilience phenotypes were explored in logistic regressions. 232 patients were evaluated, median age was 58.0 years. PACS was diagnosed in 173 (74.6%) patients. Scarce resilience was documented in 114 (49.1%) and frailty in 72 (31.0%) individuals. Predictors for SF-36 score < 61.60 were the phenotypes “frail/non-resilient” (OR = 4.69, CI 2.08–10.55), “fit/non-resilient” (OR = 2.79, CI 1.00–7.73). Predictors for EQ-5D-5L < 89.7% were the phenotypes “frail/non-resilient” (OR = 5.93, CI  2.64–13.33) and “frail/resilient” (OR = 5.66, CI 1.93–16.54). Predictors of impaired IC (below the mean score value) were “frail/non-resilient” (OR = 7.39, CI 3.20–17.07), and “fit/non-resilient” (OR = 4.34, CI 2.16–8.71) phenotypes. Resilience and frailty phenotypes may have a different impact on wellness and QoL and may be evaluated in people with PACS to identify vulnerable individuals that require suitable interventions.
