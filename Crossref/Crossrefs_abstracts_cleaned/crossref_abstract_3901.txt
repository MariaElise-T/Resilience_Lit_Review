AbstractThe development of system concepts are always challenging to visualize as well as analyze, particularly where design concepts such as resilience are a critical system attribute. We are motivated to extend our Model Based Conceptual Design (MBCD) approaches towards analyzing the resilience designed into systems in the Concept Phase. Using the example of a bushfire emergency response system, and specifically to the command and control (C2) systems, of the design concept of resilience is investigated. This paper explores the use of MBCD and its underlying framework to structure the modeling and analysis of C2 structures as they apply to various levels of severity in bushfire situations, and consider how designing for resilience can incorporated in the MBCD approach.
