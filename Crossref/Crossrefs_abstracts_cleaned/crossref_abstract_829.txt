Purpose
This study aims to determine and consolidate the multi-scale components that inform anticipatory action for resilience; propose a conceptual framework for the collaborative and holistic design, delivery and management of resilience at both the macro and micro scale; and test the efficacy of the framework to deliver sustainable (sustained) resilience.


Design/methodology/approach
A conceptual framework was proposed by consolidating what was learnt from literature review. Case studies were then used to explore the efficacy of the framework to deliver resilience. The applicability of the specific measures was also examined to determine the extent by which they support anticipatory action and resilience capacity.


Findings
It was found that a combination of active, latent, evolving and to some extent improvised yet integrated solutions can support anticipatory flood resilience at the micro, meso and macro scale, as well as the physical and social domains.


Research limitations/implications
Socio-physical resilience improves when policy makers, designers, planners and engineers work together to deliver anticipatory solutions prior to a natural disaster. Further, findings confirm that resilience can be achieved in both new and existing urban contexts.


Social implications
The multi-scale, integrated strategies can inform anticipatory practices, which, in turn, may reduce social vulnerability during and after natural events such as flooding.


Originality/value
This work lays the foundation for further theoretical and practical work on socio-spatial resilience and provides the learning-based structure within which policy makers, planners and architects can administer interventions for the practical delivery of planning-scale and building-level resilience.
