The delay-dependent resilient robust finite-timeL2-L∞control problem of uncertain neutral time-delayed system is studied. The disturbance input is assumed to be energy bounded and the time delays are time-varying. Based on the Lyapunov function approach and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques, a state feedback controller is designed to guarantee that the resulted closed-loop system is finite-time bounded for all uncertainties and to satisfy a givenL2-L∞constraint condition. Simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.
