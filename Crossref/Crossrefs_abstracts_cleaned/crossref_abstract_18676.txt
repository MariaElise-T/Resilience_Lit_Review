ABSTRACT Springs of the Vacacaí-Mirim river basin, in the Atlantic Forest biome, are protected by law because they provide an environmental service through water supply. No study provided identification, estimates and information about the seasonality of water resilience and environmental conditions of these springs, which supply the central region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This study monitored headwater flow volume and interpreted the results through seasonality and use of the flow duration curve, characterizing the springs and showing the water production capacity. As a result, the springs presented higher flow duration curve contrasts. Considering consistent monitoring time, differences in flow characteristics occurred in the analyzed springs allowed to qualify based on their persistence, temporary or ephemeral flow, showing which springs are more resilient. The shape of the flow permanence curve was different for each spring in the basin. The study was able to determine the flow duration curve and confirm the resilience and reality of a headwater of the Vacacaí-Mirim river basin, being more accurate and necessary than estimates of flow from springs.
