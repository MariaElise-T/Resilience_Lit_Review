 The main aim of the study was to assess the sources of resilience in orphans and vulnerable children in district schools in the local communities of Amajuba. The study has drawn insight from the social ecological theory of Bronfenbrenner. Being a mixed-method research approach, its design is grounded within the post-positivism paradigm. A self-administered questionnaire and individual interviews were used to collect data from 303 orphans and vulnerable children purposively sampled from schools within the Amajuba district KwaZulu-Natal for the quantitative phase, while eight orphans and vulnerable children were interviewed for the qualitative phase. Frequency distributions and a thematic analysis were employed to analyse the data. The findings establish that apart from HIV/Aids related deaths of parents, poverty, disabilities, abandonment or neglect, and COVID-19 are found to be other causes of vulnerability among the participants. Conversely, future expectations, religion or spirituality, and an extraverted personality type were found to be the sources of resilience in the participants. The inclusion of resilience in the education/school curriculum across all levels as well as resilience booster interventions are recommended for African children.
