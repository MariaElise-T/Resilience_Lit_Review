 The compressional resilience of Acrilan, Terylene, and Tricel fibers at pressures ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 psi is reported, and the effects on the resilience of various fiber properties are determined experimentally. The behavior of a mass of fibers in compression can be adequately described by an equation of the form: T = aP-b, where T is thickness of the fibrous mass, P is the pressure, and a and b are constants which depend on fiber properties and also on the experimental conditions. Fiber properties investigated were staple length, fineness, crimp and interfiber friction. Crimp has the highest influence on resilience, whereas fiber friction and fineness indicate comparatively less effect. Fiber length shows no correlation with resilience. There is little difference between Acrilan, Terylene, and Tricel as suitable materials for fiberfill.
