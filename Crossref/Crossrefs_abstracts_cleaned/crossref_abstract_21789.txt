This study aims to examine the feasibility of DNA methylation age as a biomarker for symptoms and resilience in cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). We included ten participants from our parent study, an ongoing randomized control trial study. Participants’ symptoms and resilience were assessed, and peripheral blood was collected. DNA methylation age calculation was performed using DNAge® analysis. Data were analyzed using Spearman’s correlation analysis and the Mann–Whitney U test. Participants in the intervention group tended to have a decrease in DNA methylation age and age acceleration after completing an exercise program (mean difference = −0.83 ± 1.26). The change in DNA methylation age was significantly correlated with the change in resilience score (r = −0.897, p = 0.015). The preliminary results suggest that DNA methylation age can be a potential biomarker for improving resilience in cancer survivors with multiple chronic conditions. This finding is limited by the small sample size, and a larger study is needed.
