The global public health crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities faced by state institutions that have been most critically affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Both the Member States of the European Union and the Republic of Moldova have seen the gaps that persist and must be removed. The change is a more difficult and time-consuming process, and in the event of a pandemic, everything had to be resolved in a timely manner. The results of the actions taken at state level have completely affected its economy. Thus, one of the serious effects of the coronavirus pandemic, in addition to the loss of many lives, is the international economic crisis that will leave its mark many years from now. Defective management of the coronavirus pandemic has put organizations in the Republic of Moldova to the test. Some have gone bankrupt, some have «survived» with great difficulty, others still face quite tough functional barriers. Their sustainability and functionality largely depend on the act of governance, the principles of good governance, objectivity, the processes of removing problems in this regard, the prioritization of problems, their evaluation and possible solutions to streamline the results of proposed actions. Thus, taking into account the effects of the pandemic crisis, the present scientific approach is limited to identifying the correlation between the term organizational resilience and COVID-19 with its consequences.
