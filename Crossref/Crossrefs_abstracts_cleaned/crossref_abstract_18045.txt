It is estimated that current pharmacological treatments for depression produce temporary remission in less than 50% of patients. Given the multifaceted nature of mood‐related disorders, there is a long‐standing need for innovative strategies to treat depression. Stress‐mediated synaptic maladaptations of nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons and induction of interleukin 6 (IL‐6) in the periphery contribute to depression‐like behaviors both in humans and in experimental models. We report for the first time that dietary supplementation with a polyphenol‐rich preparation significantly promotes resilience to stress‐induced depression phenotypes in a repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) model of depression. We identified two phytochemicals, malvidin‐3′‐O‐glucoside (Mal‐gluc) and dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), as the bioactive compounds from the polyphenol‐rich preparation. We demonstrated that oral supplementation with combined Mal‐gluc/DHCA can prophylactically and therapeutically promote resilience against RSDS‐mediated depression‐like phenotypes through structural and functional normalization of stress‐induced synaptic maladaptation in the NAc, and attenuation of stress‐mediated induction of IL‐6 in the periphery. Moreover, Mal‐gluc/DHCA is also therapeutically effective in treating depression‐like phenotypes in a model of increased systemic inflammation where mice were transplanted with hematopoietic progenitor cells from stress‐susceptible mice. Our studies provide novel experimental evidence that Mal‐gluc/DHCA can modulate stress‐induced depression‐like phenotypes by simultaneously targeting multiple underlying pathogenic mechanisms that are not addressed by currently available antidepressants. Given their excellent safety, drug‐like properties and their lack of interaction with monoamine receptors/transporters, our study can immediately translate into human clinical studies for the treatment of stress disorders and depression either alone or in combination with currently available antidepressants.Support or Funding InformationFunding was provided by the P50 AT008661‐01 from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), NIH R01 MH090264, NIH R01 MH104559 and NSF81200862.
