AbstractFamily Assessment Resilience Scale (FRAS) by Sixbey (2005) is based on the model proposed by Walsh (1996), allows to evaluate the processes of family resilience. The main goal of this study was to adapt the English version of FRAS to the Polish population (FRAS-PL) as there is no questionnaire in Poland to assess family resilience. After the process of translation into Polish and then back to English to check the correctness, the final version was accepted and participants (N = 502, 65% female, M = 24.60, SD = 6.86) filled out the questionnaire. To obtain the best-fitting model of the tool, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that the six-factor model fits the obtained data (χ2/df = 2.95, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.91, WRMR = 1.87). The alpha coefficients are satisfactory for all subscales (from α = 0.63 to α = 0.95). The adaptation of FRAS-PL was compared to final versions accepted in different countries and explained in the cultural context. The Polish version of the scale, named FRAS-PL, can be used for both researchers and clinicians to assess family resilience.
