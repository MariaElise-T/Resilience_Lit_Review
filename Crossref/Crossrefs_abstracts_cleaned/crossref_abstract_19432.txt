AbstractObjectiveThis study evaluated a rapidly developed program designed to support family resilience during the COVID‐19 pandemic.BackgroundGrounded in Walsh's family resilience framework, Families Tackling Tough Times Together (FT) disseminated weekly evidence‐informed content through a public Facebook group, partner organizations, and on a dedicated website.MethodFacebook and website analytics and weekly brief usage surveys (n with at least one = 74) documented program use, and pre‐ and post‐FT surveys (n with at least one = 49) assessed family connectedness, positive outlook, purpose in life, and stress.ResultsThe program was widely used and received favorable feedback. Participants reported less stress in weeks when they engaged in more program activities, and more family connectedness in weeks when they spent more time engaged in program materials. No significant changes were observed, however, in overall family resilience, self‐efficacy, family functioning, or stress.ConclusionThe FT program was widely used and appraised positively. Program involvement was favorably correlated with less stress and family connectedness within weeks, although long‐term changes post‐program were not observed.Implications for Emerging IdeasSocial media can be used as an effective mechanism for reaching families during times of adversity and provides preliminary data that can guide refinement of FT and other disaster‐responsive programs.
