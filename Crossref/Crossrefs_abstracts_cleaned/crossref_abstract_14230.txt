We investigated the relationships among the self-reflection and self-insight components of self-awareness, and resilience and stress in competitive South African tennis players. A sample of 175 male and 158 female athletes (Mage = 29.09 years, SD = 14.00) completed
 the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults, and the stress items from the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes. The results indicated that both self-reflection and self-insight were positively correlated with resilience, and that self-insight, but not selfreflection,
 was negatively correlated with stress. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that self-insight was the single significant predictor of both resilience and stress. Our findings provide support for the importance of self-awareness, particularly self-insight, in mitigating stress and promoting
 resilience among tennis athletes. The implications of engaging in selfreflective practices and attaining self-insight in terms of improved athletic performance outcomes are discussed.
