Bangladesh is known as one of the disaster-prone countries of the world. Geographical locations of the country and climate change phenomena make the country more vulnerable to a natural disaster. Most of the urban areas of the country are also susceptible to both geological and climatic hazards. These risks and vulnerabilities have been aggravated by poverty, rapid and unplanned urbanization of the country. The two major urban areas of the country including capital city Dhaka; the largest and main port city Chittagong are experiencing natural hazards, and the inhabitants of those areas are on risk. Due to the location of these two urban areas, different types of natural hazards are faced almost every year by the dwellers. The research reviewed local and global disaster framework, and recent literature works to assess the existing resilience scenario of these two cities. Informal interview of dwellers and local government officials was also conducted on both cities. This study tries to discuss the probable significant natural hazards of the two major cities of the country. The research also presents the existing resilience scenario of these two major urban areas in consideration of the global and local disaster management framework. The study will also try to suggest some recommendations to increase and improve the resilience of these significant metropolitan areas.
