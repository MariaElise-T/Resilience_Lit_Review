Purpose
While strong risk management and contingency planning are important for building capabilities useful for quick adaptation to foreseeable disruptions, they may not be useful for preparing for black swan-type events or situations that lack sufficient precedent to understand how they impact businesses. The key to creating a resilient organization relies most on resilient human capital, who are capable of withering whatever changes Chance may throw at them and the organization.


Design/methodology/approach
Using company data and semi-structured interviews, this paper presents the case study of ASK Consulting, a medium-size entrepreneurial enterprise that learned that human resources are the cornerstone of a resilient organization.


Findings
Resilient people exhibit three common traits: discipline, open-mindedness to change, and a sense of service to the team rather than themselves. Insights about these traits can be elicited by asking prospective employees three questions during their interview.


Practical implications
This case provides an illustrative case study and straightforward guidance for identifying whether a job candidate has the traits of a resilient person.


Originality/value
Much of the research into organizational resilience focuses on scenario planning, contingencies, and building organizational capabilities. This provides a much more straightforward and actionable approach that focuses on only one type of resource and is not contingent on the availability of slack time and money to implement.
