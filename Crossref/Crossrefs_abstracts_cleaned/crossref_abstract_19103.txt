The loss of environmental heterogeneity threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and spatial resilience as the capacity of ecological communities embedded in a landscape matrix to reorganize following disturbance. We experimented with phototrophic biofilms colonizing streambed landscapes differing in spatial heterogeneity and exposed to flow-induced disturbance. We show how streambed roughness and related features promote growth-related trait diversity and the recovery of biofilms towards carrying capacity (CC) and spatial resilience. At the scale of streambed landscapes, roughness and exposure to water flow promoted biofilm CC and growth trait diversity. Structural equation modelling identified roughness, post-disturbance biomass and a ‘neighbourhood effect’ to drive biofilm CC. Our findings suggest that the environment selecting for adaptive capacities prior to disturbance (that is, memory effects) and biofilm connectivity into spatial networks (that is, mobile links) contribute to the spatial resilience of biofilms in streambed landscapes. These findings are critical given the key functions biofilms fulfil in streams, now increasingly experiencing shifts in sedimentary and hydrological regimes.
