City disaster resilience and urban environmental cleanliness are two representative indicators used to assess the safety of human settlements in China’s Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). Traditional research on SDGs mainly concentrated at large-scale spatial level, such as global level or national level. It brings unclear significance to the implementation of SDGs in the county-level. The goal of this paper is to find a new calculation method to apply the index of urban disaster resilience and urban environmental cleanliness to the evaluation of county-level areas. A localization of county-level city disaster resilience and urban environmental cleanliness based on Deqing County’s situation was carried out. With quantification and projections of local data, the assessments of city disaster resilience and urban environmental cleanliness have completed. The evaluation showed that city disaster resilience is maintained at a low level, while indicators of urban cleanliness are lower than standards. The prediction of urban per capita environmental impact index based on Grey Time-Series Prediction Model was finished. The forecast showed that the urban per capita impact indicators in the next three years have not exceeded the standard line. The two indicators used to assess the safety of human settlements were consistent with the sustainable development of urban settlement. Partial results of this research were reported as a “county sample” at the first UN Geographic Information Conference held in Deqing in 2018.
