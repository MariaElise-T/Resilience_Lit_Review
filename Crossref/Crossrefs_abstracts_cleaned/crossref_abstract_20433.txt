Background: The numerous pre-hospital emergency medicine operational staff interactions with different people cause many conflicts. In addition to affecting their physical and mental health, these conflicts lead to severe problems for the health of society and patients. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the relationship between resilience and conflict management styles from the perspective of pre-hospital emergency medicine operational staff of the Medical Emergency and Accident Management Center in Golestan Province in 2022. Methods: This descriptive correlational study recruited 200 operational staff working in the pre-hospital emergency center in Golestan Province. They were selected using a stratified sampling method with proportional allocation. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory-II (ROCI-II). Results: Pearson correlation results demonstrated a direct and significant relationship between resilience and conflict management styles (P = 0.011, r = 0.180); the resilience score increased with an increase in the score of conflict management styles. In addition, resilience was directly associated with compromising (P = 0.012, r = 0.178) and integrating styles (P = 0.001, r = 0.276). Finally, a direct and significant relationship existed between job interest and resilience (P = 0.01). The linear regression analysis showed a significant relationship between the resilience score and the score of conflict management styles (Î² = 0.17). Conclusions: Resilience can improve the conflict management styles of pre-hospital emergency medicine operational staff. Moreover, job interest can enhance resilience, indirectly affecting conflict management. Pre-hospital emergency managers and officials should hold resilience training courses for pre-hospital emergency operatives.
