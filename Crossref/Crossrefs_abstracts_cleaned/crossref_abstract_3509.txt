Abstract
Workers in Le Havre developed resilience through trade union activism, political commitment and community engagement in the pre-war period. This resilience allowed them to display their anger at new hardships that appeared at the start of the German occupation. In particular, workers rioted at a major building site and demanded and achieved wage rises; and, as the RAF bombed their town day and night, they continuously made demands for danger money. Indeed, they did not change their behaviour because the circumstances in which they now lived had changed; they continued to use the skills they had learnt during pre-war industrial battles to make demands that would improve the material situation of themselves and their fellow trade unionists. This analysis differs from most of the major historiography on workers during the Occupation which claims workers during the first two years of the Occupation were broadly passive and cite the minersâ€™ strike in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais as the exception which proves the rule.
