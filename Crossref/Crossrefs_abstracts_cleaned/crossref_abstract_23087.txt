This paper discusses the development and implementation of the web-based geo-spatial information sharing and integration system that advances the multidisciplinary researches on the processes and impacts of mega-disaster. The mega-disasters predicted in Japan, such as Tokyo Metropolitan Earthquake or Nankai Trough Earthquake Tsunami, bring huge amount of damage and loss in various sectors and various regions, and the scenarios of damage occurrence and loss propagation are very complex. Hence, in order to quantify each problem to create disaster reduction strategies, it is very important to share and integrate data and findings across many disciplines and regions. In this point of view, we are developing the Urban Resilience Geoportal as the sharing site of research findings. In this paper, we discuss the concept of such system focusing on the accumulation and sharing of multidisciplinary data, the integration of damage and loss quantification methods, the collaboration with other disaster information systems, and the utilization of data to create new findings.
