AbstractObjectiveTo gain an understanding of how obstetric complications affect the lives and livelihoods of survivors.MethodsA phenomenological study was conducted between April and August 2013 at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected through in‐depth interviews among 36 women admitted with obstetric near miss. The interviews investigated perceptions, lived experiences, and meanings attached to such experiences by survivors. More specifically, the questions explored: self‐rated health; anticipated social, sexual, and reproductive health challenges; and mitigating factors.ResultsThe identified themes were prior expectations, vulnerability, body and social capital, and resilience. Women were found to approach childbirth with predetermined expectations that influenced their pregnancy and childbirth experience. Fatalism, expectations, and social insecurity markedly contributed to vulnerability. Resilience factors included ability to institute adaptations and to harness body and social capital.ConclusionVulnerabilities and their determinants were found to be inter‐related. Individuals’ social capital fluctuates over the acute crisis, necessitating multiple adaptations and coping strategies to reduce vulnerability or increase resilience. Although social and body capital may be mobilized to mitigate the effects of the obstetric crisis, they can either worsen vulnerability or increase resilience.
