An emergency response organization is resilient when it learns from and is well equipped to handle (potential) risks and hazards. In this paper, we will address the organizational resilience fit for Dutch emergency response organizations (safety regions) in relation to various types of crisis. The approach presented in this paper is based on a quantitative organizational resilience model. We validated the model by means of a survey conducted among the employees of Dutch safety regions. In this survey, we queried how the employees perceive the different attributes related to a set of crisis types. We used the results to calculate the quantitative representation of organizational resilience. We found that the presence of a Quality Management system or a Safety Management system does not significantly influence the organizational resilience of the organization. However, a statistically significant difference for organizational resilience was found in the type of staff assignment: volunteer, professional, or volunteer and professional. The volunteers rated the organizational resilience lower. We recommend to increase a safety regionâ€™s organizational resilience by enhancing communication and organizational engagement of volunteers, stop pursuing a Quality/Safety Management program and perform further research on (international) emergency response organizations.
