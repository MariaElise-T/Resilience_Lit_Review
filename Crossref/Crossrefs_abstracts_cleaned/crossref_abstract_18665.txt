AbstractObjective:Leukoaraiosis, or white matter rarefaction, is a common imaging finding in aging and is presumed to reflect vascular disease. When severe in presentation, potential congenital or acquired etiologies are investigated, prompting referral for neuropsychological evaluation in addition to neuroimaging. T2-weighted imaging is the most common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to identifying white matter disease. However, more advanced diffusion MRI techniques may provide additional insight into mechanisms that influence the abnormal T2 signal, especially when clinical presentations are discrepant with imaging findings.Method:We present a case of a 74-year-old woman with severe leukoaraoisis. She was examined by a neurologist, neuropsychologist, and rheumatologist, and completed conventional (T1, T2-FLAIR) MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and advanced single-shell, high b-value diffusion MRI (i.e., fiber ball imaging [FBI]).Results:The patient was found to have few neurological signs, no significant cognitive impairment, a negative workup for leukoencephalopathy, and a positive antibody for Sjogrenâ€™s disease for which her degree of leukoaraiosis would be highly atypical. Tractography results indicate intact axonal architecture that was better resolved using FBI rather than DTI.Conclusions:This case illustrates exceptional cognitive resilience in the face of severe leukoaraiosis and the potential for advanced diffusion MRI to identify brain reserve.
