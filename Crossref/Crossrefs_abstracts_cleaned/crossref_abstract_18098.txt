Pidie Jaya (Piday) District of Aceh Province is a newly formed district in 2007. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pidie Jaya district also experienced a series of disasters throughout 2020. Nevertheless, the Piday District Human Development Index (HDI) in 2017 exceeded the National achievement. But piday district poverty ranks 3rd in the Province. This has the potential to make the Piday district prone to disasters in addition to geographical location factors. Therefore, the existence of such gaps in this study will be discussed. This study uses qualitative methods through descriptive narrative approaches. Sources of information and data were obtained through Focus Group Decision (FGD) from several sources and studies of some literature. The results stated that the gap is due to economic development being less evenly distributed and less felt by lower-level people. This is due to low education factors and lack of capital for farmers and fishermen as the majority of workers in Piday District. The research suggests increasing community capacity and resilience by 1) Improving the quality of human resources for farmers and fishermen in the form of education and training based on improving the economy and living standards of farming communities wrapped in local wisdom; 2) Infrastructure development both facilities and infrastructure; 3) Provision of capital and ease of access in business and insurance coverage against disasters by taking into account local wisdom; 4) Empowerment of the role and involvement of local community leaders in the formulation of policies and local government institutions.
