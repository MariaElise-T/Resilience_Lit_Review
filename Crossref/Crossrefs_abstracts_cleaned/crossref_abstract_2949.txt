By mapping tacit and contested assumptions about adversity, works in this issue shift understandings of survival and resilience from individual assets to spaces of solidarity, collective action, culture-building and community identity. Spanning diverse institutional, geographic, community and subjective sites, authors chart new terrains for knowing, representing and experiencing survivals, ruptures and resiliencies.
