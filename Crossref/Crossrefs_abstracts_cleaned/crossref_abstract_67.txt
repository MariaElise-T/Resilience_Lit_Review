PurposeThe objective of this study was to assess the relationship among intersectionality, vulnerability and resilience with evidence. The conceptual framework developed by the study believed that intersectionality and vulnerabilities intersect and reduce the level of disaster resilience.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative approach was followed with relevant support from both primary and secondary data to conduct the study. The study focused on flood as a specific natural hazard to assess the relationship among the indicators of the objective. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed in two different flood-prone areas of Bangladesh. FGDs included young men, young women, men and women with disabilities and older people. Also, secondary literature helped to support ground-level data.FindingsIn the face of a flood, results showed that people with intersectional characteristics become more vulnerable within the at-risk groups. There are differences in people's level of vulnerabilities among the people of vulnerable groups. The results support the discussion that intersectionality exaggerates vulnerabilities, thus reducing the level of disaster resilience. The study summarizes that intersectionality needs to be addressed while supporting groups at risk to achieve a resilient community.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is only based on qualitative and secondary data. For more generalized findings and implications, further research is needed. Also, this study will work as a guideline for future studies.Originality/valueThe study is one of the few works related to intersectionality. This study will open a new window to understand the importance of focusing on intersectional conditions while developing plans for disaster risk reduction (DRR).
