AbstractSodium salts of ethylene‐co‐ethyl acrylate‐g‐maleic anhydride show high rebound resilience, the same as those of both saponified ethylene‐co‐ethyl acrylates and sodium salts of ethylene‐co‐methacrylic acids at low salt contents. The measurements of thermal and mechanical properties and dynamic viscoelastic behaviors indicate that the sodium salts of ethylene‐co‐ethyl acrylate‐g‐maleic anhydride behave like strong ionic bond cross‐linkages close to covalent bond cross‐linkages in the polymer, differing from the monocarboxylate salts of saponified ethylene‐co‐ethyl acrylate and the sodium salts of ethylene–methacrylic acid. It is concluded that the strong cross‐linking of the dicarboxylate salts of the neutralized ethylene‐co‐ethyl acrylate‐g‐maleic anhydride causes the high rebound resilience. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
