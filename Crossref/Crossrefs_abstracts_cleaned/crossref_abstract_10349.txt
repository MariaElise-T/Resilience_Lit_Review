AbstractStudies about the sources of critical accidents in operating human‐made systems indicate that most of them are commonly attributed to errors made by the human operators. These findings motivated the development of a guide for designing and developing systems which are resilient to operational errors. This article reports on the development of such a guide by the Gordon Center for System Engineering at the Technion. Assuming the Human Factors variant of Murphy's Law, the guide applies the STAMP paradigm of self‐control in scenario‐based design, relying on a model of resilient operation. The guide suggests designing three firewalls, for preventing latent threats, preventing escalation and learning from incidents. The effectiveness of the guide was evaluated collaboratively in a special INCOSE_IL working group, by examination of its applicability to case studies. The guide was validated by scoring the guidelines applicability to failure modes observed in a special database of 67 mishaps.
