Person with Disabilities (PWD) is an individual that suffers a long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, preventing one from full and effective participation in society when faced with challenges. The challenges and pressures as a disabled person are very high especially for the individual that was born normal. The relation of PWD with hardship and poverty is very close because of the inability to manage oneself, run a business or find a job to generate an income. The tenacity and strength to rise again by an individual who has faced the misfortune or difficulty shows the characteristics of a person who has a high resilience. The Resilience Model is applied in this study as a guideline to enhance the resilience among PWD’s entrepreneurs. The findings of this study focus on the external protective factors (social support, psychological intervention, public facility and source of inspiration) and the internal protective factors (religion, learning motivation, awareness of social support and self-identity) that influence the level of resilience among PWD’s entrepreneurs. Hence, it is believed that this study could help the PWD’s entrepreneurs to sustain their business while for the authorities like Department of Social Welfare (JKM) and Zakat Centre need to strengthen their role in order to realize the PWD-friendly ecosystem. A future empirical study would be able to strengthen the Resilience Model as suggested in this study.
