Purpose
Cultural heritage is about people, their history and their identity. Protecting cultural heritage from natural hazards by connecting it with disaster risk management (DRM) directly benefits local communities. Cultural heritage also has a global dimension, and collaboration and support from the international community to protect it is vital. Culture and heritage differ among countries, as do natural hazards, but practitioners face some common challenges, such as the need to create awareness. The paper aims to discuss these issues.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper presents: a brief overview of the current connection between DRM and cultural heritage in the global context; an analysis of how international knowledge-exchange initiatives can help countries improve the resilience of their heritage sites, using Bhutan as an example; and a proposal to keep this topic moving forward in both the international and national agendas for sustainable development and resilience.


Findings
International knowledge exchanges may help to find solutions, and Bhutan is a good example. This small, hazard-prone country in the Himalayas, has strong traditions and heritage, and is aware of its vulnerabilities and risks. Learning from Japanâ€™s extensive experience, Bhutan has been working with international experts to improve the resilience of its cultural heritage sites.


Originality/value
The ultimate aim is that this paper serves as an inspiration for other countries, as well as international organizations such as the World Bank, to keep strengthening ties between DRM and cultural heritage.
