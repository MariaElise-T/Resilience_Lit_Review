In any type of vehicle a number of mechanical sources generate structure-borne noise. The energy is transmitted from excitation points to surrounding structures. These radiate noise externally and internally. The most commonly used method to reduce the radiated noise is to mount the sources resiliently to the supporting foundation. The insertion loss due to the resilient mounting can in many cases be extremely poor. This could be due to the break down of the stiffness of the foundation in the audible frequency range. At the same time the stiffness of the mounts could be increased drastically as compared to the static stiffness. A test rig and measurement procedures for determining the dynamic properties of mounts are described. Measured and predicted results are compared for rubber mounts with simple geometries. The insertion loss of a resilient mounting very much depends on the location of the engine feet on a foundation. Case studies relating to passenger vessels and catamarans built with aluminum and sandwiched are presented. Reduction of both noise and weight is discussed.
