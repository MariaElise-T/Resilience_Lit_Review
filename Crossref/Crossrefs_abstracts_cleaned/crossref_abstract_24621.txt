 Different from other forms of power generation, wind power generation has the characteristics of randomness, intermittentness, and volatility. Therefore, the wind power generation system (WPGS) is more prone to failures caused by external impacts during the operation. The reliability of the WPGS has a significant influence on the safety of large-scale power grid systems. Thus, how to accurately evaluate the reliability of the WPGS that is integrated into large-scale power grid systems has become a new challenge. Implementing effective resilience management in WPGSs can improve their ability to handle interruptions and increase the safety of the grid-connected system. This research proposes a new method of resilience management based on importance measure for the WPGS after multi-node failures due to natural disasters or man-made accidents. Firstly, both the performance of the WPGS before multi-node failures and the performance of the WPGS after multiple nodes failures are analyzed. Then, the performance loss and the performance recovery of the WPGS are evaluated. Finally, a new method for judging the loss importance measure of node, the recovery importance measure of node, and the resilience importance measure are proposed. The objective of this research is to analyze the restoration sequence of failed nodes in the WPGS with multi-node failures such that the system recover can be faster and more effective. The proposed method is proven to be effective by introducing the WPGS into the IEEE five-machine 14-node system.
