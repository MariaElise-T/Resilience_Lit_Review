The following investigation was realized with the objective to characterize the personal factors that influence in the development of resilience in 200 children aged between 7 and 12 years in families linked to the program Red UNIDOS in the city of Ibague, for this was applied the inventory of resiliency factors proposed by Salgado (2005), which evaluate the level of self-esteem, empathy, autonomy, humor and creativity. The results show that the sample is in the middle of the factors evaluated (61%) and that 69% did not face adequately the adversity. We conclude that adult significant training children require psycho-afective formation to enable them to generate environments based on the self awareness of their children. Is proposed to design a training program for parents to incorporate into their speeches and actions positive representations on their children, so that achieving self-assertive and enable them to develop the ability to overcome adversity.
