Surakarta City, a secondary city in Indonesia, has been threatened by floods
   for many decades due to the overflow of rivers and an inadequate urban
   drainage system. On top of that, inelastic time-bound city planning has made
   the city susceptible to ever-increasing flood threats. The local authority
   has attempted to minimize flood risk through particular structural
   mitigations of the urban drainage system, which it has authority to do,
   while the overall responsibility for flood control and river management is
   under central authority. The different responsibilities of these two
   different levels of authority have led to gaps and overlaps in relation to
   the same objects of interest. On one hand, the city authority is concerned
   with city planning, and on the other hand, the flood control and river
   management authority is responsible for combatting flooding problems and
   river management within the watershed. This issue is an interesting point to
   investigate. In order for Surakarta to become a resilient city, it is
   imperative to synergize the efforts of these two different levels of
   authorities. This study aims to find the synergistic and optimal solutions
   by means of a negotiated planning and management system that involves both
   authorities. Critical evaluation and assessment of relevant documents, field
   observations, and measurements, as well as acquiring expert opinions were
   the main methods used in this study. We propose a ZOPA (Zone of Possible
   Agreement) model to optimize agreement among the stakeholders. The model
   essentially highlights the common interests and sets aside the conflicting
   points among stakeholders. The study found that there are potential points
   to negotiate with regard to the division of responsibilities through a
   shared vision of the coordinated institutions and shared planning and
   management in the direction of synergistic determination.
