The resilience concept encompasses dispositional attributes as well as different forms of social and external support. Cognitive and structural aspects of social support systems in a given context can be described as social capital. In this study, we explored the relationship between resilience and social capital in 265 HIV‐positive South Africans living in a context of adversity. Data were collected using the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and a social capital questionnaire. The RSA showed good overall reliability (α = .81), but the subscales were only partially replicated. Resilience was best predicted by the demographic variables household income, education, self‐reported health, marital status, and area of living; however, cognitive social capital in the form of bonding and bridging trust, norms of reciprocity, and social cohesion also predicted resilience. Access to basic resources, perceived good, close networks, and social norms contributed to resilience in this study.
