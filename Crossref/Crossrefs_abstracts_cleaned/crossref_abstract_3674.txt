 Results of an experimental program utilizing the repetitive rigid plate load test in a test-pit facility and the laboratory resilient modulus test are presented for five typical subgrades in Florida. The subgrade materials were tested in the test pit under three different moisture conditions, that is, (1) optimum, (2) drained and dried, and (3) soaked. Laboratory resilient modulus tests were conducted on reconstituted soil samples simulating the various moisture conditions. The resilient modulus was significantly affected by the moisture content of granular subgrades. A comparison between the deformations measured from the test-pit test and the deformation calculated from the laboratory test was made. It was experimentally verified that the resilient modulus resulting from the laboratory triaxial test could be used to predict the resilient deformation of pavement subgrade layers.
