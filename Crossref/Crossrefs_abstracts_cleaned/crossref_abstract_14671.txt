During COVID-19 period, positive psychology and positive aspects of human nature become important. The aim of this study is to examine the mediating role of self-transcendence and psychological resilience in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and subjective happiness in university students during the COVID-19 period. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, Self-transcendence Scale and Subjective Happiness Scale were completed online by 437 university students. According to the results of correlation analysis, positive significant correlations were found between psychological resilience, self-transcendence and subjective happiness and fear of COVID-19 was negatively related to these variables. The mediating roles were examined by using the bootstrap method with Hayes’ PROCESS template. As a result of this analysis, the serial multiple mediation of self-transcendence and psychological resilience in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and subjective happiness was statistically significant. Obtained findings were discussed in line with the literature and suggestions were made to the researchers.<p> </p><p><strong> Article visualizations:</strong></p><p><img src="/-counters-/edu_01/0555/a.php" alt="Hit counter" /></p>
