AbstractTobacco is one of the most widely cultivated nonfood cash crops, a source of income, model organism for plant molecular research, a natural pesticide and of pharmaceutical importance. First domesticated in South Americas, the modern-day tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is now cultivated in more than 125 countries to generate revenues worth billions of dollars each year. However, the production of this crop is highly threatened by the global presence of devastating infectious agents, which cause huge fiscal loss. These threats have been battled through breeding for acquiring disease resilience in tobacco plants, first, via conventional and now with the use of modern molecular breeding approaches. For efficacy and precision, the characterization of the genetic components underlying disease resistance is the key tool in tobacco for resistance breeding programs. The past few decades have witnessed significant progress in resilience breeding through advanced molecular techniques. The current review discusses history of tobacco breeding since its time of origin till date, highlighting the most widely used techniques and recent advances in molecular research and strategies for resistance breeding. In addition, we narrate the budding possibilities for the future. This review will provide a comprehensive and valuable information for the tobacco growers and researchers to deal with the destructive infectious diseases.
