BackgroundObstetrics and gynaecology training is a demanding vocation; there is a paucity of data on trainee resilience and well‐being in this field.AimTo investigate resilience, support and perceived levels of stress and burnout in Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) trainees.Materials and MethodsA cross‐sectional survey of RANZCOG trainees in Australia and New Zealand (n = 638) was distributed electronically in May 2018.ResultsTwo‐hundred and thirty‐one (36%) valid responses were received. The mean resilience score was moderate (mean = 77; SD = 11). Resilience was significantly associated with general health (F = 7.5, P = 0.007), depression in the last two weeks (F = 4.4, P = 0.013) and seriously considering leaving the program at some point (F = 15.4, P < 0.001). Most participants (204; 88%) stated improvements could be made to the level of trainee support; with over half identifying the support they received from RANZCOG to be low or very low (132; 57%). One‐third of participants (76; 33%) rated the support from their direct supervisor as low to very low. Over half of all participants identified high to very high responses to: burnout (127; 55%); personal stress (134; 58%); workplace stress (143; 62%) and depression (103; 45%).ConclusionRANZCOG trainees exhibit moderate resilience levels, yet they report high levels of perceived stress, depression and burnout and low‐level support from direct supervisors. This may highlight the need for enhanced support and working conditions to allow trainees to remain resilient and thrive in their careers.
