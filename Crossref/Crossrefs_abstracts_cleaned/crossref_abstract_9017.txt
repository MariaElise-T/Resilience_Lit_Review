AbstractBackgroundResearch shows that there are connections among academic burnout, resilience, and life satisfaction in medical students. However, no study has yet examined the temporal relationships between academic burnout, resilience, and life satisfaction among medical students. This longitudinal study aimed to examine the temporal associations between academic burnout, resilience, and life satisfaction and to explore the possible mediating role of resilience in the relationship between academic burnout and life satisfaction among medical students.MethodsThis is a three-wave longitudinal study covering the preclinical education period of 20 months. From October 2018 to June 2020, a total of 190 students majoring in clinical medicine filled out the Chinese College Student Academic Burnout Inventory (CCSABI), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) three times. Cross-lagged models were constructed to examine the temporal relationships between academic burnout, resilience, and life satisfaction and longitudinal mediation models were constructed to explore the possible mediating role of resilience in the association of academic burnout with life satisfaction.ResultsAmong medical students, resilience uni-directionally and positively predicted life satisfaction, while academic burnout uni-directionally and negatively predicted life satisfaction. However, the temporal association between resilience and academic burnout was negative and somewhat bidirectional. Resilience had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between academic burnout and life satisfaction in medical students.ConclusionsMedical educators need to identify and take effective measures to combat academic burnout problems which can lead to reduced life satisfaction among medical students. Resilience-based interventions may be promising in buffering the negative impacts of academic burnout and improving life satisfaction. It is recommended that effective resilience-promotion interventions be developed and implemented in medical education to help enhance medical students’ psychological well-being.
