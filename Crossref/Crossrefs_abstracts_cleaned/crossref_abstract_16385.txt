Abstract
Bumiaji Sub-District is located in a mountainous area with a high-risk level of landslides. Throughout 2017-2022, there were 45 landslide events affected physical, social, and economic damages. One approach to reduce disaster risk is building community resilience. This research aims to assess Landslide Community resilience in Bumiaji Sub-District. It is important to describe the characteristic of resilience level in each village. This research was done by using AHP to determine the weight of variables and indicators, then calculated with Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC) based on six variables: Physical, Social, Economic, Environmental, Community Capital, and Institutional. Data was collected by primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected by using interviews with experts from the government and the local community in Batu City, and secondary data was collected from the literature study. The results of AHP show that the highest priority of indicators is community preparedness, and the lowest priority is the number of health facilities. The weight of each factor was multiplied by the values of the indicators to assess the landslide community resilience index. The highest level of community resilience is Punten, caused by the high score in Physical, Economic, and Institutional aspects. The low level of resilience is Bumiaji and Pandanrejo Village. Both villages did not have regular mitigation programs to strengthen local communities, so the resilience level of community capital is low.
