Abstract

The exposure of the basin of Lake Urmia to meteorological droughts under climate change scenarios is investigated in this study. If there is any justification for attributing the catastrophic disappearance of the lake to climate change, the resilience of the basin to droughts should be investigated. This is examined by a climate change modelling involving downscaling: use 11 general circulation models to provide climate variables downscaled to a high spatial resolution of 57 stations deriving a correlation between observed time series at the base period and climatic variables; projection: derive precipitation at near and far future using the equations; and drought studies: derive 1-month standard precipitation index at the base, near, and far future periods. The results identify the following: (i) in the base period, the lowest and highest biases are âˆ’2.5 and 3.7 mm, respectively; (ii) in the near/far future periods, the zones are less prone to meteorological droughts in the south, where water is plentiful, but are more prone in its north, where water is relatively scarce; (iii) the areas are likely to get drier or wetter but their ratios are unlikely to change. This resilience underpins the urge to appropriate policymaking, decision-making, and planning systems to ensure that the basin is made incrementally more resilient.
