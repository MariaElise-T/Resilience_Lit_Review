This study is an empirical inquiry into the adoption and practice of metaphysical components such as organizational mindfulness in management and its relationship with social realities such as organizational resilience in Nigerian businesses, specifically as it applies to Hospitality Firms in Rivers state, Nigeria. As a cross sectional survey, data for the study was generated using structured questionnaire from 39 respondents across 8 sampled registered hospitality firms. A total of three hypotheses were postulated with analysis revealing significant correlations between organizational mindfulness and the measures of organizational resilience; Affective commitment, organizational involvement and Customer Satisfaction; implying that the adoption and practice of organizational mindfulness is a prerequisite for effectively attending to and addressing work-related issues and thus enhancing organizational resilience. In conclusion, the findings of this study lend credence to its support for the adoption and practice of organizational mindfulness in achieving a more sensitized and supportive work environment and thereby a more desirable expression of work attitudes from employees. It was thereafter recommended that organizations should on a consistent basis, assess their dispositions and the applicability of their systems and technologies within their various contexts. The applicability of such features determines their effectiveness and also impacts on their resilience.
