 Canadian social workers were surveyed about early adversities, mental health, and resilience. Bivariate analysis ( n = 236) was conducted to understand relationships between predictor and outcome variables; and logistic regression analyses were conducted for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and resilience. The impact of pandemic-related factors was also investigated. The results indicate that social workers are experiencing concerning levels of mental health issues, with significantly lower levels of resilience in younger social workers. A trauma and resilience informed approach to workplace policies and practices is urgently required to support social workers’ mental health needs.
