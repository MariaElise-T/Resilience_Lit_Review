 The current study is a phenomenological examination of the resilience strategies of South Asian immigrant women in the United States who survived child sexual abuse. Semistructured interviews ( N = 5) and a focus group ( N = 8) were analyzed to gain a deep structural understanding of participantsâ€™ experiences of child sexual abuse and resilience. Findings included four subthemes of South Asian context (strict gender socialization, maintenance of family image, influence of ethnic identity, acculturative stressors) and five subthemes of resilience strategies (use of silence, sense of hope, South Asian social support, social advocacy, intentional self-care). Research and practice implications are discussed.
