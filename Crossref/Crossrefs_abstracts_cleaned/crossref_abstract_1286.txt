Abstract. In the context of climate change and increasing urbanization, floods are considerably affecting urban areas. The concept of urban resilience may be an interesting means of responding to urban flood issues. The objective of this research is to propose a spatial decision support tool based on geovisualization techniques and a resilience assessment method. The goal is to localize the level of resilience modelled in different territories. The methodology proposed consists of integrating three resilience indicators applied to a case study in Avignon (Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur region, France) and the use of geovisualization techniques: using GIS for data processing and analysis, visualization, mapping, and model processing. The methodology integrates decision-making by identifying characteristics capable of improving urban resilience and facilitating its understanding using a visual tool. The results demonstrate the usefulness of modelling resilience using geovisualization techniques to identify the potential for local resilience; integrate local stakeholders into a process of clarifying the concept through the contribution of visualization; and consider easier access to this concept based on data analysis, processing and visualization through the design of maps.
