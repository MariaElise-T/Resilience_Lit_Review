In order to understand the effect of community-based tourism (CBT) on sustainability, bespoke instruments are required. This paper advocates the application of resilience thinking as a theoretical-methodological resource suited to this purpose. The methodological perspective proposed here focuses on two core elements in the functioning of any socio-ecosystem in which CBT is developed: (1) diversification of productive activities; and (2) collective participation in tourism. To reflect on this proposal empirically, an ethnographic case study was conducted on the island of Floreana (Galapagos). The analysis shows that resilience thinking is an appropriate strategy to study the effect and significance of CBT with regard to the general resilience of the socio-ecosystem and, therefore, the sustainability of its desired configuration. The analytical perspective proposed here allows us to understand: (1) how CBT functions in a specific case; (2) its contribution to the resilience of the socio-ecosystem; and (3) the consistency of that resilience by virtue of the functioning model of CBT. This analytical model furthers the study of CBT as a strategy for sustainability.
