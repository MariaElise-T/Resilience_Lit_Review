AbstractThe Nordic welfare model is often used as an example for the promotion of health and wellbeing, even in vulnerable groups of children, such as refugees. Nonetheless, there are no published reviews on resilience and/or risk and protective factors for physical and mental health among refugee children living in Nordic countries. In this systematic review, we identified 5181 studies on the topic, screened titles, and abstracts, viewed 632, and finally included 26 studies. These studies described 18 samples with a total of 34,080 individuals ranging in ages 0–18 years. Overall, the studies were of good quality. Nearly all studies assessed adversity. Six studies reported physical health outcomes and all studies mental health outcomes, most often post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. None explicitly studied resilience. While we found that age and sex are the most frequently studied  risk- and protective factors, findings are inconclusive, since the direction of the associations was different in the different studies. This systematic review indicates that there is still a need for well-designed and -powered studies using clear definitions of key study concepts to examine health outcomes and resilience among refugee children in Nordic countries.
