This paper focuses on the perceptions and mentalities of teachers from the public teaching system from Romania regarding the ways that they were into contact with the eLearning platforms due to COVID 19 pandemic period. Even though in Romania at that time, or in present there are no legal framework regarding the eLearning platforms for pupils. By exception from the National Ministry of Education from Romania, the eLearning platforms were considered a proper solution for Romanian system for teaching during COVID 19. Once with the end date of the alert situation for COVID 19, 8 March 2022, and after finding the advantages of eLearning system a law project proposal is in discussion for proper regulation.
The pilot study was focusing on semi-structured interview and participatory observation of the 39 teachers from public national system from Romania (North East and Bucharest-Ilfov development areas). They act from the first level of education, â€“ kindergarten, continuing with primary school, elementary school, high school and until the final level, - meaning, university.
The result of our pilot study reveals the fact that there are two types of teachers that use eLearning system, the `active` and `passive` type. Each of them have their own characteristics and were resilient to change because of lack of abilities for eLearning and not having references points from where to start. Step by step they became more self-confident and take into consideration to include in the future the eLearning system into their onsite future teaching method.
