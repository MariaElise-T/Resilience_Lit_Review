AbstractThe present study aimed to examine whether loneliness and resilience played the roles of mediators on the relationship between perceived social support and depression. A total of 712 Chinese rural‐to‐urban migrants from Nanjing, who were measured with perceived social support, resilience, loneliness, and depression, participated in the study. Results indicated that perceived social support and resilience were negatively associated with depression. Loneliness was a significant and negative predictor for depression. In addition, we also revealed that resilience and loneliness partially mediated the relationship between perceived social support and depression. These findings might develop a better understanding of depression in the course of migration.
