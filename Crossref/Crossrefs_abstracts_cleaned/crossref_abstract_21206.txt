<p>Aim. The study is focused on studying the manifestations of resilience, self-activation and coping strategies of mothers depending on the type of challenge, assessment of its strength and the presence/absence of disability in their children. Materials and methods. The study involved women (N=271) aged 24 to 55 years, including 156 mothers of healthy children and 115 mothers of children with disabilities. A socio-biographical questionnaire and a package of techniques were used: Self-activation technique (M.A. Odintsova, N.P. Radchikova); Resilience test (E.N. Osin, E.I. Rasskazova); SORET questionnaire (E.I. Rasskazova, T.O. Gordeeva, E.N. Osin). Results and conclusions. The relationship between the social and demographic characteristics of mothers and their assessments of the situation of the call is revealed. Less constructive coping strategies (mental withdrawal from the problem, denial, behavioral care, etc.) are more often used by mothers with a high assessment of the strength of the challenge; positive reformulation, humor and planning are more often used with low assessments of the strength of the challenges, regardless of the presence of disabled children in the family. Mothers raising children with disabilities are characterized by lower rates of physical activation, the level of which is lower with high estimates of the strength of the challenge.</p>
