Abstract
Building resilience into water systems is very important in urban areas, particularly in less-developed countries, as poor-quality systems have adverse effects on human development and poverty reduction. This mixed-methods study aims to assess the resilience of household water systems and their impact on the quality of life (QOL) after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Data were obtained from 1,500 households using a questionnaire and six focus group discussions. The resilience of each household's water system was assessed in terms of residents' pre- and post-earthquake perceptions of water security. Approximately 60% of the households considered their water systems to be resilient. Piped water and wells were associated with stronger perceptions of water system resilience. Participants who considered their household water system to be resilient had higher QOL than those who considered their water systems vulnerable after the earthquake. Qualitative data showed that both the quality and quantity of water deteriorated due to an earthquake. To mitigate the adverse effects of natural disasters on water security, we recommend strengthening the water system infrastructure and operations as well as implementing collaboration between governments and local people.
