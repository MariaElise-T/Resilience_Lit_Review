The 2009 “pesticide package” changed the European Union’s approach to increasing its resilience to synthetic pesticides’ detrimental effects and health risks. It promoted the common goals of reducing volumes, reducing treatment frequency, improving efficacy, reducing risks of pesticide usage, reducing impact, reducing pesticide use in specific areas, and increasing public knowledge and awareness of plant protection products (PPP) usage and effects. Part of the “pesticide package,” Directive 2009/128/EC demanded that each EU MS crystalize by 2012 their approach to these goals in National Action Plans (NAPs) designed to systematically assess the situation and propose objectives and measures to achieve the Directive’s aims. This article presents a dynamic analysis of the changes that took place between the first (by 2012) and second (by 2019) generation of NAPs and evaluates in measures and a timetable the observed progress in achieving the first goal of Directive 2009/128/EC We assess how the EU MS approach to minimizing risks to public health has changed in this intrinsically environmental policy. We show that improvements-proposing measures designed to achieve the Directive’s first goal in all EU MS can be observed, but increasing coherence in measures, timetables, and indicators is needed to accomplish the SUD and EU Green Deal goals.
