 This article builds on the author's research in East and Central Africa, specifically Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia. It examines minority world resilience theory and explores its application in the majority world, for children in need of protection (CINP).The term ‘minority world’ refers to those in the developed world where the minority of individuals live, and the ‘majority world’refers to those in the developing or underdeveloped world. CINP are defined and the construct of resilience is presented. The strengths and limitations of various programmes are examined, an argument to support these children is offered and limitations are extrapolated upon.
