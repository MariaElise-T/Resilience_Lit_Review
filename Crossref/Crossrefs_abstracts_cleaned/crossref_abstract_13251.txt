PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to synthesize coherent theory that identifies and links the cognitive and structural elements in both the psychosocial and organizational dimensions of resilience.Design/methodology/approachThe approach takes the form of the author's review of and reflections on the dynamics of resilience in living systems in general, and in humans in particular, drawing on seminal scholarly publications across trans‐disciplinary fields of scientific research.FindingsHuman resilience is recounted and documented in narrative form across spatial and temporal gradients: retrospectively – in historical perspective; introspectively – in the immediate aftermath of traumatic events and/or experiences; and prospectively – in anticipation of crisis. Measurements or assessments of human resilience vary according to the research questions being addressed. The variables may relate to resilience as an outcome or a process. Resilience is also assessed as an emergent attribute of individuals and communities who may have undergone post‐traumatic growth, and/or transformation associated with self‐organized and self‐governing systems. Complex systems where key functions and core identity and integrity are sustained may be examined under an integrated explanatory theoretical model that allows for systems' resilience to be measured as anOutcome; monitored as aProcess; identified as anEmergent property; andNarrated – hence,OPENtheory.Practical implicationsDecision makers faced with contemporary questions of how best to embark on the fast‐moving sort of “runaway train” concept of resilience may findOPENuseful as a tool for identifying, understanding and promoting human resilience – a basis for sustainable futures.Originality/valueThis conceptual paper offers original insights with a pragmatic analytical tool that coherently links the cognitive and structural elements of human resilience.
