 This research examines the protective influences of social support and professional resilience to probation officers’ cynicism and service impact simultaneously. Data on psychological characteristics of a sample of 382 forensic social workers in Chinese legal systems were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and multiple-group analyses were used in a three-step analysis process to test our research model. Results identified that cynicism was negatively associated with probation officers’ service impact, ascertained that social support functioned as an extrinsic pull mediating the relationship between probation officers’ cynicism and service impact, and determined that professional resilience served as an intrinsic push moderating the impact of cynicism and social support on service impact, respectively. This research proposed a push and pull mechanism by which probation officers’ service impact is increased and their work pressure is alleviated, providing tentative recommendations for the alleviation of probation officers’ job pressure and improvement of their service impact.
