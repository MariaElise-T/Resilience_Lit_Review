In the context of resource depletion and global warming, the energy transition has become a necessity. To provide a basis for analysis and to support countries in this transition, it is necessary to better understand this transition. The creation of a good measurement tool could help. This paper proposes a measure of national resilience through an analogy to kinetic energy. Preliminary results show that some countries have strong potential for resilience in the energy transition. Inequalities exist and still exist in terms of accessibility to energy but the energy transition could generate an interesting catch-up for the most vulnerable countries. Finally, the impulse of the transition seems to be easier than the completion of this transition.
