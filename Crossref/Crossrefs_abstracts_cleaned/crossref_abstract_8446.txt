Abstract
The article offers an explanation of the distinct trajectories of policy development of the American and European Union regulatory regimes for genetically modified foods and crops. The permissive American regulatory regime has been resilient; the rigorous EU regime, much less so. The account of policy development and policy resilience directs attention to the foundational ideas and material legacies of regulatory policies at an early critical juncture of their development, and the distinct mechanisms of reproduction that resulted. It argues that the constitutive ideas of US policies for GM crops and foods, and the material coalitions these ideas induced, created power and functionalist mechanisms of reproduction that have stabilised policies and limited reforms to incremental adaptations. By contrast, the initial critical juncture of EU policy development resulted in core ideational principles that relied on different functional and legitimation logics. Their material (power) base much weaker, early EU regulatory policies for GM foods and crops failed to be resilient when the institutional and normative context shifted.
