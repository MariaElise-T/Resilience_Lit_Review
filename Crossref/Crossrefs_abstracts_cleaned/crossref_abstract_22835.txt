Previous research has indicated that supplementing an apparently 
adequate diet with additional protein improves both 
host resistance and resilience in lambs infected with 
Haemonchus contortus. The present study tested the influence of 
supplementation with non-protein nitrogen (urea). Helminth-naive 
Hampshire Down lambs were given an apparently 
adequate basal diet or a diet supplemented with urea. The lambs were 
then infected with Haemonchus contortus for 
10 weeks. Supplementation with urea had no discernible effect on 
resistance to infection; faecal egg counts, worm burdens, 
worm lengths and mean number of eggs per adult female worm did not 
differ between the 2 groups. However, lambs on 
the supplemented diet showed better resilience; they had greater 
packed red cell volumes, higher plasma albumin 
concentrations and increased liveweight gain compared to lambs on 
the basal diet. The loss of appetite following infection 
was less in lambs fed the urea-supplemented diet. The observed effect 
of urea supplementation was seemingly due to 
greater food consumption as well as the better diet.
