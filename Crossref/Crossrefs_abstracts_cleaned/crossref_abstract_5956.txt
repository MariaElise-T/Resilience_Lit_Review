The traditional UAV swarm assessment indicator lacks the whole process description of the performance change after the system is attacked. To meet the realistic demand of increasing resilience requirements for UAV swarm systems, in this paper, we study the modeling and resilience assessment methods of UAV swarm self-organized networks. First, based on complex network theory, a double layer coupled UAV swarm network model considering the communication layer and the structure layer is constructed. Then, three network topological indicators, namely, the average node degree, the average clustering factor, and the average network efficiency, are used to characterize the UAV swarm resilience indicators. Finally, the UAV swarm resilience assessment method, considering dynamic evolution, is designed to realize the resilience assessment of the UAV swarm under different strategies in multiple scenarios. The simulation experiments show that the UAV swarm resilience assessment, considering dynamic reconfiguration, has a strong correlation with the network structure design.
