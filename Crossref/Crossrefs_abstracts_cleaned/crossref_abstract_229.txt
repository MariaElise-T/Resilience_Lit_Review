The results of research conducted by Werner and Smith (1992), Rutter (1983), Garmezy (1991), and others indicate that school media specialists can play an important role in promoting resiliency and building assets in youth. By developing programs and services that build connections, encourage reading and hobbies, and teach problem-solving and social skills, media specialists aid in the development of resiliency. Understanding the theories of resiliency, assets, and developmental tasks will position school media specialists to become change agents in their communities and schools by strengthening the environment in which children and teens learn. The author discusses the models developed by Benard, Wolin and Wolin, Milstein and Henry, and the Search Institute that school media specialists can apply to their media center programs and services. Practical suggestions are provided.
