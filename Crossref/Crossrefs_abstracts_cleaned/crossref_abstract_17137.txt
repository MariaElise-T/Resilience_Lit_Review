Research has uncovered resilience as a dynamic and alterable process. However, few studies have examined resilience across the life span, particularly with men who are at high risk of a myriad of poor health outcomes. Study aims were to explore protective factors and resilience across the life span among a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged men ( N = 32), considering the context of their lived experiences, using focus groups. Thematic analysis resulted in four themes: (a) mainstream protective factors (i.e., prosocial activities, generative opportunities, supportive adults, community investment), (b) context-specific protective factors (i.e., growing up early, criminal justice involvement, gang involvement), (c) demonstration of mainstream resilience, and (d) demonstration of context-specific resilience. This study adds to the limited body of resilience research with marginalized men. Findings point to targeted changes at the structural and environmental levels, in addition to individual-level interventions, to affect meaningful change in the lives of socioeconomically disadvantaged men.
