After the death of a spouse, widows make adjustments in carrying out multiple roles, facing negative stigma from society related to their widowhood. Resilience is needed by individuals to be able to survive in difficult circumstances. The ability of resilience in individuals depends on how much social support is obtained as an individual protective factor in dealing with pressure.
