<p>There recently started researches of the personal and organizational resilience in the sphere of education that significantly enriched studies of the school successes/ failures and consequently actualized the big range of issues related to the subject of studied phenomenon. They included the questions that had key importance from the pedagogical point of view that covered the major factors of students&rsquo; personal resilience development, its correlation with traditions and peculiarities of the school, interdependence of resilience and academic performance of the students. The overall research of the outlined interdependences assumed that the students characterized by the higher personal resilience possessed higher study motivation and actively utilized support of the society while solving the problems and more inclined to the democratic style of the study cooperation, actively attended optional classes. Response analyses of the 722 questioned students of the 5-9 grades of 8 schools of 2 municipal regions of Republic of Tatarstan gave the unexpected results. The students referred to the resilient category demonstrated different personal characteristics. Among those there were academically successful students and the middle range ones, that ones who refused support of the society and actively accepted that, the ones who normally demonstrate study independence and those who prefer external control. The identified diversity of the resilient students allowed to assume existence of different styles of resilience and defined the necessity to consider those styles when performing deeper analysis of the studied phenomenon. Results of the research of correlation of the personal resilience of the students and the set of internally aligned characteristics of the educational process given in this article allowed to look at the studied phenomenon from a different angle. It became almost imperative to perform deeper analysis of dependance of personal resilience upon the external conditions and also upon the inner personal characteristics of the individual and relation of the resilience with independence and emotionality of the student in regards to the study process.</p>
