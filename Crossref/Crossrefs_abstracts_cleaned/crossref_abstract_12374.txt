Abstract Besides increasing productivity, prefabricated building systems can also contribute to the reduction of the levels of risk exposure by workers. However, there are several hazards that can be faced by workers involved in the assembly of prefabricated components, such as being struck by objects during lifting and handling of large components, and falls from height. This paper is focused on the assembly process of precast concrete building systems, widely used in Brazil. It is uses the Resilience Engineering theoretical framework, which has been pointed out as the new paradigm to manage health and safety, being concerned with the abilities of a system to adjust its functioning prior to, during, or following changes and disturbances, so that it can sustain required operations under unexpected conditions. The aim of this paper is to propose guidelines to design preventive measures, based on the identification of resilient skills used by front-line workers involved in the process of assembling precast concrete structures. Those skills were identified in a case study carried out in a construction site in Brazil, in which some critical assembly processes were analyzed at a fine level of detail.
