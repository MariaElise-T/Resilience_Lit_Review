Objectives: A metaverse refers to a virtual-reality platform in which users can interact with computer- generated environment, to socialize. It has really enhanced the internet-based and online education. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of flipped learning on mental
 health through metaverse. There is a huge potential for expanding learning and knowledge through metaverse, and educational institutions worldwide are evolving to incorporate this concept. To explore the effects of flipped learning on mental health through the metaverse, the study examined
 the moderating influence of e-learning and cyber resilience by adopting interactive methods in the context of China. Methods: The study employed a quantitative design by conducting surveys from students in Chinese educational institutions. A sample of 350 questionnaires was distributed
 among the students, out of which 324 complete questionnaires were obtained for further analysis. Results: The findings showed a significant effect of flipped learning on mental health through metaverse. It also exposed the significance of the moderating effect of cyber resilience. In
 contrast, the moderating effect of e-learning was found to be insignificant between flipped learning through metaverse and students' mental health in Chinese educational institutions. Conclusion: The study provides insightful and practical guidelines for China's education and cybersecurity
 departments.
