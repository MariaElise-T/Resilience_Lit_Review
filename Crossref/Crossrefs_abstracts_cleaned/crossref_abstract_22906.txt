With the development of urbanization and the evolution of urban network systems, multimodal urban transport network (MUTN) systems play a vital role in improving network effects and operational efficiency. However, urban transport networks are easily affected by natural disasters and traffic incidents, which can lead to significant human and economic losses. Accordingly, it is vital to be able to assess the resilience of transport networks in the face of various disruptions. This study, therefore, utilizes complex network theory to analyze the resilience of multimodal urban transport networks, with the resilience accessed based on topological indices. The MUTN in Beijing is selected as a case study for simulation analysis. Based on the road network and subway network, a model MUTN is established, and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate random attacks. The results show that the MUTN in Beijing has good resilience against disruptions. This study guides the evaluation of the overall resilience of multimodal urban transport networks and will be useful for transportation planners and decision-makers in dealing with emergencies and natural disasters in the future.
