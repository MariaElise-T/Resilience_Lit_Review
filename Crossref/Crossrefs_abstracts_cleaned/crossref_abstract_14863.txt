            enticate users. To be specific, lights released by a screen, are blocked and reflected by one hand above it; in this propagation process, hands exhibit user-specific ability in driving light absorption and attenuation due to owning unique structures, thereby outputting discriminative intensity patterns representing user identity. To implement
            LIPAuth
            , we first study the impact of screen contents on light intensity patterns, also explore the possibility of embedding hand structure biometrics into these patterns. We then design a customized dynamic stimulus-response mechanism for
            LIPAuth
            and make it resilient to the risks of potential registration profile leakage. Subsequently, we construct a joint pipeline consisting of signal processing and a learning-based generative adversarial network to overcome interference from variable user behaviors. More importantly,
            LIPAuth
            just utilizes common sensors to capture light signals, hence achieving low cost. We finally conduct extensive experiments in three scenarios to evaluate the authentication performance of
