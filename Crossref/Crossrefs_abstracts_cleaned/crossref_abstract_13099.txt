Abstract
Agroforestry is seen as a land management technique that can address many of the issues faced by smallholder farmers, such as climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation. Agroforestry helps farmers adapt to extreme weather events, create resilient microclimates for crops and livestock across regions, and help combat climate change. An important role of agroforestry in tackling climate change may be to reduce CO2 emissions by actively sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Soil stores the largest carbon stock (77%–92%) in agroforestry systems, with trees, herbaceous plants, and deciduous trees absorbing 7%–22% and 1%, respectively. Smallholder farmers in developing countries not only build resilient agroecological systems that actively absorb carbon, but also revert to more natural production systems that provide better ecological and social functions. By doing so, we can prevent climate change. Agroforestry not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves the resilience of agricultural landscapes, but also can contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation by promoting species migration to more favorable conditions and carbon sequestration. Climate projections could see production declines in much of sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbating food insecurity among citizens.
