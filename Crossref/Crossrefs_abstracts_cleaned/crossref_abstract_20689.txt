Abstract
Social changes in the context of climate change include the character of capitalism and the relationship between nature and culture that encourages people to respond to climate change and adapt their livelihoods. The purpose of this study is to calculate coral density in the context of ecological resilience and its effect on sustainable tourism in Pari Island, DKI Jakarta. The research method uses a survey with the Line Intercept Transect method. Sampling was carried out at a depth of 5 and 7 meters, depending on the presence of coral. The length of transect used is 50 meters and is placed parallel to the shoreline of the island. The results showed: First, most of the coral reefs in Pari Island are still in good and healthy condition. Of the 15 sample points observed, only 2 showed coral mortality due to internal and external factors in the sea. From the results of the analysis it was concluded that the condition of healthy coral reefs in the waters of Pari Island had a high density. Meanwhile, stressed or dead coral reefs have a low density. This condition indicates that coral reefs are still effective in supporting tourism activities.
