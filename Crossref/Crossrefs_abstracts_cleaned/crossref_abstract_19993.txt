 Climate projections predict more frequent and severe drought in coastal Pseudotsuga menziesii forests of western North America, raising concerns over how to promote drought adaptation. Thinning often increases drought resistance (the ability to maintain growth during a drought) and resilience (the ability to recover growth after a drought), but these effects vary with thinning intensity, shift over time, and may have tradeoffs with fiber production. We collected tree cores from a long-term thinning study with four residual density levels replicated across both uniform thinning and thinning with gaps, and used annual growth data to investigate responses to droughts occurring 8 and 21 years after thinning. For the first drought, resistance and resilience were higher in treatments with lower residual densities. For the second drought, there were no differences in drought response between the lowest and highest residual density treatments, and all treatments had lower drought resistance and resilience than for the first drought. Spatial arrangement had little impact on drought resistance or resilience and residual density level had a significant effect on the periodic annual volume incrementâ€”drought resistance tradeoff. Our results suggest that thinning can promote drought adaptation in Pseudotsuga menziesii forests, but these effects dissipate over time.
