Understanding climate change impacts involves discussing the scientific evidence, ranging from rising temperatures and extreme weather events to shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity loss. Navigating pathways to a resilient future could cover mitigation strategies like reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to changing conditions, and fostering sustainable practices. Climate change stands as one of the most pressing challenges of our time, impacting ecosystems, economies, and societies globally. This paper presents a comprehensive review aimed at understanding the multifaceted impacts of climate change and exploring potential pathways toward building resilience in the face of these challenges. The paper first delves into the scientific evidence behind climate change, emphasizing rising global temperatures, the intensification of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and their manifold impacts on natural and human systems. From the loss of biodiversity to disruptions in agricultural patterns, these effects permeate every facet of life, underscoring the urgency of action. Building resilience necessitates a multifaceted approach (for example, Australian Research Council 2009),. Mitigation strategies play a pivotal role, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through policy interventions, technological innovations, and shifts in societal behaviour. Concurrently, adaptation measures emerge as imperative, emphasizing the need for communities to adapt to the changing climate by enhancing infrastructure, diversifying livelihoods, and promoting sustainable resource management. The paper highlights the significance of international cooperation and policy frameworks in addressing climate change. Collaborative efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, provide a
