The aim of the study was to examine the impact of moral resilience on quiet quitting, job burnout, and turnover intention among nurses. A cross-sectional study was implemented in Greece in November 2023. The revised Rushton Moral Resilience Scale was used to measure moral resilience among nurses, the Quiet Quitting Scale to measure levels of quiet quitting, and the single-item burnout measure to measure job burnout. Moreover, a valid six-point Likert scale was used to measure turnover intention. All multivariable models were adjusted for the following confounders: gender, age, understaffed department, shift work, and work experience. The multivariable analysis identified a negative relationship between moral resilience and quiet quitting, job burnout, and turnover intention. In particular, we found that increased response to moral adversity and increased moral efficacy were associated with decreased detachment score, lack of initiative score, and lack of motivation score. Additionally, personal integrity was associated with reduced detachment score, while relational integrity was associated with reduced detachment score, and lack of initiative score. Moreover, response to moral adversity was associated with reduced job burnout. Also, increased levels of response to moral adversity were associated with lower probability of turnover intention. Moral resilience can be an essential protective factor against high levels of quiet quitting, job burnout, and turnover intention among nurses. This study was not registered.
