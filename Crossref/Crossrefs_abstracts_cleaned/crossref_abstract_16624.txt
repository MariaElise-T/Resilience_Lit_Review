SummaryMicrobialite‐producing microorganisms that inhabit the Puna lakes are traditionally considered constituents of fragile microsystems, unable to resist important environmental variations. Nevertheless, this region has experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the Holocene, raising the unsolved issue on how microbialite‐forming systems have been able to resist these changes. Turquesa lake, located within Quaternary Peinado lake‐basin (Puna), faces a hydric crisis in the last decades, which modified their physicochemical conditions. However, there has been a rapid re‐establishment of the microbialite systems once the main parameters were stabilized, which allowed the establishment of three new microbialite levels in the coast and paleo‐coastline. The aim of this contribution is to report for the first time microbialite levels in Turquesa lake, providing a multiscale analysis, besides an accurate study of the physico‐chemical context of the lake. This new record provided us the opportunity to demonstrate the short‐term resilience capacity of these microbialite‐producing microorganisms to climatic changes, offering a key approach to understand analogue processes throughout Earth history.
