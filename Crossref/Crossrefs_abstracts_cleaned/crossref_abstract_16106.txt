PurposeSmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) mainly rely on their structure and internal networks to achieve their goals and remain competitive. However, their limited internal capabilities and complex environments can hinder their stability. Thus, this study evaluated the relationships among specific factors toward fostering organizational resilience (OR) in tourism SMEs.Design/methodology/approachA multi-methodological approach was adopted to address this research study, including (1) social network analysis (SNA) to formulate the conceptual model and (2) construct validation through partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM).FindingsThe six proposed hypotheses were supported. These results suggest that addressing these variables and relationships after considering management style and people development as critical factors can foster OR in tourism SMEs.Research limitations/implicationsThe ideas that were developed were constrained to the organizational domain. Although the results apply to the Mexican context, this limitation can be offset by extending the proposal to other emergent regions or organizations. This can also increase the generalization of the results and foster improvements in the approaches applied.Practical implicationsAcademics and managers must rethink resilience as the final state generated by multiple factors. This requires reconfiguring inner organizational interactions, providing more autonomy to operative units, reinforcing business intelligence and improving feedback mechanisms.Originality/valueThis research study contrasts previous studies because it proposes that SNA be exploited to avail of the advantages it confers in designing the conceptual model. In this regard, we present new relationships to promote OR and provide new avenues in order to improve the analysis of adaptation processes.
