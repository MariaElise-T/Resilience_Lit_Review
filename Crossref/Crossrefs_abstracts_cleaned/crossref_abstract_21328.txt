This study examined the relations among perfectionism dimensions, resilience, and distress. Participants were 413 undergraduate students. All 3 of Hewitt and Flett's (2004) dimensions of perfectionism were associated with greater reports of depression and anxiety; however, only socially prescribed perfectionism was significantly associated with resilience. Results indicated that resilience partially mediated the relations between socially prescribed perfectionism and distress. Implications for counselors in the prevention, assessment, and treatment of depression and anxiety are discussed.
