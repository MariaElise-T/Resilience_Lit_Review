Infrastructures are connected between themselves and their connections form a complex network. Disaster impacted infrastructures have a reduced level of serviceability. The impact of the reduction of serviceability of disaster-affected infrastructures cascades through the entire infrastructure network. The recovery capacity of the network governs the recovery curve of a disaster-impacted infrastructure network system. Moreover, the speed of recovery of the infrastructure network from a post-disaster condition to the pre-disaster condition dictates the resilience of the system. Building these capacities requires spending money. The extent of resilience that can be afforded under a given budget situation is termed as the feasible resilience. This paper presents a framework for planning the capacities so that the feasible resilience of the network can be maximized under a budget situation. To achieve the said objective, the recovery time of a disaster-affected infrastructure network has been minimized. The outcome is the optimal restorative capacities the network needs to have so that the feasible resilience is maximized under a specified budget condition. The outcomes can be used by the decision-makers in natural disaster risk mitigation planning.
