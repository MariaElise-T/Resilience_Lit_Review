To promote the healthy development of urban agglomerations in the Yellow River Basin, we construct a multi-city network-resilience evolution model based on social network theory, combined with QAP regression analysis and analyze the evolution of multiple-city network resilience in the Yellow River Basin in 2014 and 2021 by screening and drawing on indicators in social networks. The results show that (i) only the financial linkage network and the information exchange network are resilient networks, and the magnitude of the evolution of resilience level in the Yellow River basin is finance > information > innovation > transportation. (ii) Except for the increase in the hierarchy of transportation networks, other networks show the trend of flattening. (iii) The matching of the information exchange network shows a shift between heterogeneity and homogeneity, and the transmission and aggregation of the network fluctuate. Based on the studyâ€™s findings, a path to improve the resilience level of the Yellow River Basin urban agglomeration by consolidating the status of core cities, optimizing the structure of multiple city networks, and optimizing the flow of factors is proposed.
