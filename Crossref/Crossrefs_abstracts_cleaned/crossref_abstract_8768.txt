The impacts of disasters on the community are not necessarily determined by the scale of a disaster, but are influenced significantly by the preparedness of the community, including the health community. Resilience is a dynamic quality within a community that is developed and strengthened over time. Evidence of the Western Australian (WA) health system resilience was demonstrated on 22 March 2010 when two severe weather fronts crossed the Perth metropolitan area and severely impacted a significant number of hospitals, the State pathology service, radiological services in tertiary and secondary hospitals, as well as aged care, mental health and other key health facilities. This storm has resulted in more than 120,000 claims and the total estimated cost is expected to exceed 1 billion Australian dollars, making it the most costly disaster due to natural hazards in WA history. Damage to these facilities included: (1) flooding, ceiling collapse, and broken windows in intensive care units, emergency departments, and operating theatres; (2) loss of radiological services; (3) sewerage inflow into wards, resulting in evacuation of mental health inpatients; (4) infrastructure damage to aged care facilities requiring relocation of residents; and (5) extensive loss of electricity and communications throughout Perth, which impacted on home oxygen therapy clients. A public health response also was required due to sewerage overflow into Perth's main river systems. This presentation will provide an overview of the event, lessons learned and how these lessons learned will be used to further enhance the health community's resilience.
