AimThis study examined the role of both positive and negative aspects of social relationships with partners, friends, and children on the psychological well‐being of Greek elders, as well as the potential mediating role of resilience.MethodsThe sample included 100 Greek older community‐dwellings recruited from three care centres. They completed questionnaires consisted of the Scales of Psychological Well‐Being, the shortened Family Members’ Interrelating Questionnaire, the Significant Others Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Brief Resilience Scale.ResultsThe findings suggested that mental health (i.e. depression), rather than physical frailty, and a negative relationship with the oldest child, rather than a lack of social support from family or friends in general, have detrimental effects in elders’ well‐being. In contrast, resilience has a positive effect on well‐being that mediates the association between negative relating with the oldest child and well‐being. Elderly parents perceived their child's relating more negatively than their own relating towards the child, and it was the child's negative relating to them, rather than their relating toward the child, that predicted their psychological well‐being. An interdisciplinary approach to the care of the geriatric population is highlighted.ConclusionsTo improve elders’ well‐being and enhance successful ageing, the determinants of well‐being should be key targets of ageing research. Policy, prevention, and intervention actions should address the modifiable variables of any underlying emotional and social issues among elderly people (i.e. depression, negative relating with children, and resilience).
