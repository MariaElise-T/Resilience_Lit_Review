Psychological well-being is fundamental to the overall health of undergraduates, particularly to enable them to address challenges at the university. A review of related literature showed that there are various factors influencing individual’s psychological well-being. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of resilience on the psychological well-being of university undergraduates. For this purpose, a total of 200 undergraduates from local public universities (male = 90, female = 110) participated in this exploratory study. Responses were analysed using Smart PLS 3.0 to model the influence of the two variables. Results demonstrated two significant findings. Firstly, reliable and valid adapted instruments measuring resilience and psychological well-being were established, and secondly, resilience is a significant predictor and it explained 48.2% variance in psychological well-being. The findings are discussed in relation to the development of a model that relates the two constructs.
