 Resilient devices are commonly used in lightweight structures to decrease sound transmission in a broad frequency band. Applications of such devices may be found in e.g. resilient mounted ceilings in aeroplanes, ships and buildings. A measurement method to characterise the frequency dependency of the transfer stiffness and the input stiffness of the resilient device is presented. The mechanical characteristics of the measurement method are investigated. In addition, some resilient devices used in buildings are analysed with respect to acoustic properties. Parameters such as static load and mountings for the devices are considered and handled by means of statistical analysis.
