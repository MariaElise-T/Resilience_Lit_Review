Dhaka is one of the fastest growing cities in the world, faces persistent urban environmental challenges. Environmental degradation, environmental pollution, flooding, high temperature, erratic rainfalls etc. on life and livelihoods of the city people have posed Dhaka a risky, vulnerable, unsustainable, unlivable and fragile city. In this context, this paper tries to measure resiliency through identifying Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) of ward no. 28 under the jurisdiction of Dhaka South City Corporation (Old Ward no. 64 of Dhaka City Corporation) considering five dimensions-Physical, Social, Economic, Institutional and Natural. This ward is representing the old Dhaka scenario which represents a segment of the capital of Mughal Bengal. There are some major factors under every dimension that have been considered to measure the index. By giving different weightage to different aspects finally CDRI has been measured for ward no. 28. The result shows that the overall average CDRI value for ward no. 28 is 2.65, which indicates that the natural disaster resiliency level is moderate. It also been suggested that by improving communication and accessibility, enforcing zoning and density control by the concerned Development Authority, partnership and collaboration with the people by social capital enhancement program; savings liked insurance programs; leveraging of existing strength in terms of external institutional networks, internal networks etc. can strengthen climate disaster resiliency in ward no. 28.Â
