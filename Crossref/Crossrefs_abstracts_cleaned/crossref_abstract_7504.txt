Abstract
The use of Twitter as a platform to share and exchange information between emergency responders, water service providers and the public during an emergency situation is becoming more evident. The sharing of real-time information is invaluable for situational awareness and effective emergency response. To explore this integrated approach, twitter profiles for Local Resilience Forums and Water Service Providers were analysed to demonstrate their connectedness. It was discovered that the connectivity between the Local Resilience Forums and the Water Service Providers was limited and further research is being conducted to establish why these connections do not exist.
