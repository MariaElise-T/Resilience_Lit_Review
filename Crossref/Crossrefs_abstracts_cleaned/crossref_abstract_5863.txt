Although an extensive literature has accumulated documenting the maladaptive outcomes
associated with childhood victimization, a limited body of knowledge addresses resilience. This
paper sought to operationalize the construct of resilience across a number of domains of
functioning and time periods and to determine the extent to which abused and neglected children
grown up demonstrate resilience. Substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect from 1967 to
1971 were matched on gender, age, race, and approximate family social class with nonabused and
nonneglected children and followed prospectively into young adulthood. Between 1989 and 1995,
1,196 participants (676 abused and neglected and 520 controls) were administered a 2-hr
in-person interview, including a psychiatric assessment. Resilience requires meeting the criteria for
success across six of eight domains of functioning: employment, homelessness, education, social
activity, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, and two domains assessing criminal behavior
(official arrest and self-reports of violence). Results indicate that 22% of abused and neglected
individuals meet the criteria for resilience. More females met the criteria for resilience and females
were successful across a greater number of domains than males. We speculate on the meaning of
these findings and discuss implications for the child maltreatment field. Limitations of the study
are also acknowledged.
