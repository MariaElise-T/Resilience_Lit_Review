Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic brings a big shock to Malang city. Meanwhile, the city is also stressed out due to population development and the high flow of urbanization, especially because of students who continue to live in Malang City and in the suburban areas. Urbanization is the result of planning to develop Malang City as an educational city with various educational institutions. This research aims to formulate the sustainability indicator of Malang City regarding resilient city amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample used to measure the sustainability indicator is Lowokwaru District. Regarding the development planning of Malang City as an education city, Lowokwaru District is a very suitable sample because 1/3 of the universities in Malang City are concentrated in Lowokwaru District. Besides, there are also other educational facilities such as 12 elementary schools, 11 junior high schools, nine senior high schools, and eight vocational high schools. Therefore, Lowokwaru District is measured by the sustainability indicator, namely density, diversity, and compactness to formulate a resilient city amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of calculations and interpretations from similar studies show that the sustainability of Malang City is at a moderate level of sustainability in terms of resilient city amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with a moderate population density (101.1-200 people/ha); medium building density (20-40 buildings/ha); the level of random diversity (the closest neighbour value is 1.1 and the entropy index is 0.51), where the distribution of facilities and infrastructure is not evenly distributed throughout the districts; and compactness is almost uneven.
