Lower yield in dryland conditions is often associated with drought. Eastern Dry Zone of Karnataka, dominated with arid and semi-arid climate is characterized with predominant drought which is conjugated with reduced rainfall intensity and intermittent dry spells measures to overcome upgraded agricultural practices such as appropriate varieties, scientific methods of crop establishment, in-situ moisture conservation techniques and ex-situ rain water harvesting and its productive utilization was demonstrated from 2011 to 2019 at farmers field of Chikkamaranahalli cluster finger millet varieties sown under different sowing windows long duration (MR-1) for July sowing, medium duration (GPU-28) for August first fortnight sowing, short duration (GPU-48) for August second fortnight sowing performed well opening of in-situ moisture conservation furrows in between paired rows of pigeonpea in finger millet + pigeonpea (8:2) and groundnut + pigeonpea (8:2) inter cropping system recorded higher yield than that of farmers practice. Among the different crop establishment techniques transplanting of finger millet and sowing using modified bullock drawn seed drill resulted in superior yield over broadcasting. Thus climate resilient practices along with timely advisory services helped in maintaining sustainability.
