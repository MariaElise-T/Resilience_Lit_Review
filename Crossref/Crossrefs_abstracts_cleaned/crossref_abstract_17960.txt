Abstract

Objective:
Previous studies have shown that parental attachment was associated with higher levels of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in individuals who have experienced traumatic events. The aim of the current longitudinal study is to investigate resilience as one pathway through which parental attachment is related to PTG among Chinese adolescents following the Yancheng tornado.


Methods:
A total of 351 adolescent survivors participated in this longitudinal study. Participants completed the revised version of Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA-R) at 12 months (T1), and the revised Chinese version of the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI-R) and the Connor and Davidson’s Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) at 18 months (T2) after the tornado, respectively.


Results:
It indicated that parental attachment at T1 has direct and positive effect on PTG at T2, and resilience at T2 fully mediated the relationship between parental attachment at T1 and PTG at T2.


Conclusion:
The findings revealed that parental attachment and resilience are two key resources that promote adolescent’s PTG, and parental attachment acts through resilience to promote PTG in adolescents.
