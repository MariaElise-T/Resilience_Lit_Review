The relationship of fear of COVID-19, resilience, and religiosity in the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, which affects life in many areas of psychological, social, economic, cultural, religious, has been examined in this study. In this study, 337 people, including 219 women (65%) and 118 men (35%), participated.Â  The present research was a descriptively based quantitative study based on the relational survey model. COVID-19 Fear Scale, Brief Resilience Scale and Religiosity Scale were used to collect data. In addition, a Personal Information Form was used to obtain information and opinions about COVID-19 and determine demographic characteristics. The t-test, correlation and regression analysis were used in statistical processes. The findings obtained in this research showed that women have more fear of COVID-19 than men, and men have higher resilience and religiosity scores than women. In addition, it was observed that there was a significant and negative relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and resilience, religiosity and age, a significant and positive relationship between resilience and religiosity and age, and a significant and positive relationship between religiosity and age. Finally, it was found that resilience, religiosity and age together were predictors of COVID-19 fear. However, when looking at the t-test results of the significance of the regression coefficients, it was seen that only resilience was a significant predictor of COVID-19 fear. The findings obtained are discussed in light of the literature.
