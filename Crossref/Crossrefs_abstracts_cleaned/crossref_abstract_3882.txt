At seismic events, the building society need to be sustainable in terms of its functionality at post-seismic event. During the seismic event, the performance of the building gets gradually deteriorated. Two approaches which relates with strength and serviceability are important to maintain the building sustainable at disaster events. In first approach, the member sizes are increased which leads to higher base shear design for the futuristic events. In second approach, the building is designed with higher ductility with reduction in member sizes. Since, the sustainability addresses the socio-economic impacts of a building society, the most efficient approach is assessed. Though it’s possible to have sustainable society, it does not mean that it is resilient in case of disaster event. This indicates that even if a society/city is socio-economically efficient and environmental friendly in terms of green building concept, it is not said to be sustainable in extreme events. Hence, in this study the building’s resiliency is estimated and addressed.
