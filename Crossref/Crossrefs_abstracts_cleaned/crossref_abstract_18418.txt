Evaluation and improvement of resilience in ecoindustrial parks have been the pressing issues to be addressed in the study of safety. In this paper, eco-industrial systems are extracted as symbiosis networks by using social network analysis first. We then construct a novel cascading failure model and propose an evaluation method of node importance according to the features of symbiosis networks of eco-industrial parks. Based on the cascading model, an effective new method, that is, the critical threshold, is put forward to quantitatively assess the resilience of symbiosis networks of eco-industrial parks. Some theoretical analysis is furthermore provided to the critical threshold. Finally, we take Jinjie eco-industrial system in Shanxi Province of China as a case to investigate its resilience. The key potential nodes are identified by using our model. We also find the respective relation among the resilience of symbiosis networks and the parameters in our cascading model. Theoretical analysis results and numerical simulations both show the optimal value of the tunable load parameter with which the strongest resilience level against cascading failures can be attained in symbiosis networks of eco-industrial parks.
