Over the past 70 years, resilience, engagement, and motivation (REM) studies have largely developed as independent theoretical and research disciplines. Yet, in conducting a thorough literature review of these three work-related fields, we discovered that they share some identical or similar concepts, e.g., self-efficacy. We also discovered that concepts from these three fields of study could be integrated into a more comprehensive research model. That model can then be used to provide a prescription to help managers improve their employees’ and their organizations’ outcomes of performance, productivity, quality, etc. Therefore, we provide an analytical review of these theories and research findings as they psychologically impact employees in work environments. We synthesize the growing knowledge regarding the primary factors influencing REM and provide eight useful REM research propositions to inform the model. The model features antecedents to resilience, engagement, and motivation. From this work, we posit that an integrated, practical model will be needed to improve employee involvement and performance that ultimately impacts organizational performance. Therefore, we focus primarily on those REM psychological characteristics of organizational members as they relate to antecedent concepts and conditions. A critique of the state of the REM literature is provided and targeted suggestions are outlined to guide future empirical and theoretical work in a meaningful direction.
