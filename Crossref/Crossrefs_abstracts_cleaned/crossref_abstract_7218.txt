PurposeThis paper aims to clarify the resistance degree of group road logistics to flood disaster resilience. The paper measures the resilience of group road logistics by establishing network structure model. The purpose of this study is to improve the resilience of road log.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopts Delphi method to collect data, interviews mainly flood management experts and supply chain risk management experts, and then analyzes the data through the network structure model combined with interpretative structure model (ISM) and analytical network process (ANP).FindingsThe results show that flood frequency and drainage systems are the main factors affecting the resilience of road transport logistics in urban areas. These research results provide useful guidance for the effective planning and design of urban road construction and infrastructure.Research limitations/implicationsHowever, the main factors affecting the resilience of road transport logistics are likely to change with the development of factors such as climate, economy and environment. Therefore, in future work, the authors' research will focus on the further application of this evaluation method.Practical implicationsThe results show that the impact of flooding on the four dimensions of road logistics resilience varies. This shows that in deciding what intervention measures are to be taken to improve the resilience of the road network to flooding, various measures need to be considered.Social implicationsThis paper provides a more scientific analysis of the risk management ability of the road network in the face of floods. In addition, it also provides a useful reference for urban road planners.Originality/valueThis paper addresses a clear need to study how to build models to improve the resilience of road logistics in flood risk.
