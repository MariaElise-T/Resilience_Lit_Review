Soil is a dynamic and living natural resource, which supports to produce goods and services of value to humans but not necessarily with perpetual ability against the degradative processes.  It is well known that soil formation is a slow process, and a substantial amount of soil can form only over a geologic timescale. Soil misuse and extreme climatic conditions can damage self-regulating capacity and give way to regressive pedogenesis (Pal et al. 2013), and thus might lead to the soil to regress from higher to lower usefulness and or drastically diminished productivity. Such an unfavorable transformation of soils is termed as â€˜soil degradation'. However, soils do have an inherent ability to restore their life support processes if the disturbances created by anthropogenic activities are not too drastic and sudden, and mitigated with enough time is allowed for life-support processes to restore themselves. This intrinsic ability of soils to regenerate their productivity is called resilience (Szabolcs 1994). Therefore, soil resilience is the ability to bounce back or return to normal functioning, after adversity, for sustainable productive purposes.
