 A reliance on informal supports and neighborhood relationships has its history within the African American community as a useful strategy for building and maintaining overall resilience. It is known that a history of systemic oppression gave rise to distinct cultural barriers to social services and resources, leading to a reliance on community to help foster success in the African American community. Thus, the notion of neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) is assumed to be a valuable protective process to explore for African American youth. The current exploratory study utilizes multilevel growth curve modeling to examine the relationship between NCE and aspects of resilience over time. Findings reveal a significant, positive relationship and important implications for culturally responsive study and practice.
