The Covid-19 virus has a negative impact on the world economy. However, the economic activities of the "Baduy indigenous people" who live in the interior of Lebak Regency, Banten Province, were not hindered during the Covid-19 pandemic. The main purpose of this research is to see the relationship between culture and economic resilience strategies, especially in the "Baduy community” during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis. Another uniqueness of the "Baduy Tribe" culture, namely simple happiness and healthy and frugal living. The method used in this research is quantitative. The data used are primary and secondary. 100 respondents were obtained. Secondary data is obtained from the interview process with the resource person. Based on this explanation, it can be concluded that there is a positive influence between culture (customs), namely culture (simple happiness) and culture (frugal and healthy living) on the economic resilience of the “Baduy community”. This finding certainly raises a new hypothesis that happiness can influence a new development in the field of economic resilience. In the future, it seems that there needs to be more collaborative research between social science and business economics for the development of economic resilience strategies for a region or country.
