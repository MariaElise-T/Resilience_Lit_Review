 The superblock of Kampung Melayu in Jakarta, Indonesia, is an urban morphology amalgamated by the environmental and infrastructure challenges raised by Jakarta’s inevitable urban growth. Low-income settlements like Kampung Melayu are particularly susceptible as a result of the city’s rapid and uncontrolled urban sprawl, erratic tropical weather, increasing sea levels and unparalleled environmental stresses. The proposed research utilises a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for an in-depth investigation of the many relationships within the urban fabric to address these difficulties. The experiments demonstrate an alternate urban strategy for a flood-resilient Kampung that investigates the selection techniques coupled with the use of population-based algorithms. While preserving the irregularity that has been ingrained in the history of the urban form, the results address the environmental and demographic stresses of the urban village.
