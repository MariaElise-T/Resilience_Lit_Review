Ego-resiliency is a set of traits that promotes positive adaptation to life’s vicissitudes. High ego-resiliency helps in upholding one’s personality system when facing adversity and in adjusting it to new environmental demands. Our study aimed at evaluating the connections between ego-resiliency, the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. A total of 604 Polish citizens aged 16 to 69 years participated in the online survey. Ego-resiliency was measured with the Ego Resiliency Scale (ER89-R12), anxiety and depression with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and life satisfaction with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Statistical analyses were performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The results revealed correlations between the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, and the intensity of ego-resiliency. Individuals with a high level of ego-resiliency tended to experience a lower intensity of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, individuals with a high level of ego-resiliency exhibited a higher level of life satisfaction. Our conclusions might assist in better understanding the close link between levels of ego-resiliency, the occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and satisfaction with life among Polish individuals experiencing crises.
