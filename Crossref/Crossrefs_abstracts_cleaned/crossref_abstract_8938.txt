This article introduces a techno-economic analysis aimed at identifying the optimal total size of movable energy resources (MERs) to enhance the resilience of electric power supply. The core focus of this approach is to determine the total size of MERs required within the distribution network to expedite restoration after extreme events. Leveraging distribution line fragility curves, the proposed methodology generates numerous line outage scenarios, with scenario reduction techniques employed to minimize computational burden. For each reduced multiple line outage scenario, a systematic reconfiguration of the distribution network, represented as a graph, is executed using tie-switches within the system. To evaluate each locational combination of MERs for a specific number of these resources, the expected load curtailment (ELC) is calculated by summing the load curtailment within microgrids formed due to multiple line outages. This process is repeated for all possible locational combinations of MERs to determine minimal ELC for each MER total size. For every MER total size, the minimal ELCs are determined. Finally, a techno-economic analysis is performed using power outage cost and investment cost of MERs to pinpoint an optimal total size of MERs for the distribution system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, case studies are conducted on the 33-node and the modified IEEE 123-node distribution test systems.
