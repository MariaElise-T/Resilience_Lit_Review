Individual and family characteristics that predict resilience among children exposed to domestic violence (DV) were examined. Mother–child dyads (n = 190) were assessed when the children were 2, 3, and 4 years of age. DV‐exposed children were 3.7 times more likely than nonexposed children to develop internalizing or externalizing problems. However, 54% of DV‐exposed children maintained positive adaptation and were characterized by easy temperament (odds ratio [OR] = .39, d = .52) and nondepressed mothers (OR = 1.14, d = .07), as compared to their nonresilient counterparts. Chronic DV was associated with maternal depression, difficult child temperament, and internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Results underscore heterogeneous outcomes among DV‐exposed children and the influence of individual and family characteristics on children’s adaptation.
