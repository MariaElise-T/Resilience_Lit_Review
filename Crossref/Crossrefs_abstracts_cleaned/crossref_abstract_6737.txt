The state of exception is provided for in constitutions in response to emergency 
situations. The resilience of constitutions is tested in such situations, which are 
marked by the concentration of power in the executive and limitations in the 
exercise of fundamental rights. Although the Greek Constitution allows for the 
declaration of a state of siege, this does not include the case of a public health 
crisis. Nevertheless, particular constitutional provisions form an emergency 
mechanism, which proved to be effective against the COVID-19 pandemic and 
in accordance with democracy and the rule of law.
