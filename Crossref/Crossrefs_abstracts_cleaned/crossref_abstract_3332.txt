BACKGROUND: Many employers are turning to training programs to help them cope or flourish in life. Many programs on the market have not been validated. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effect building awareness and skill development can have on sustaining high resilience within a group of employees. METHODS: 524 participants completed the 44 itemed Q-Life assessment. A CFA model was conducted to determine whether the Q-Life score, adequately describes the data. 116 employees signed up to the Q-Life experience with 64 completing all requirements. RESULTS: The RMSEA index was less than 0.08, RMSEA = 0.07, 90%CI = [0.07, 0.07], which is indicative of a good model fit. The mean of score for resilience on the first test (M = 249.91) was significantly lower than the mean of post-test (M = 264.91). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the model demonstrated acceptable fit to the data and can be used as an assessment tool for the Q-Life. The Q-Life experience showed significant improvement in resilience.
