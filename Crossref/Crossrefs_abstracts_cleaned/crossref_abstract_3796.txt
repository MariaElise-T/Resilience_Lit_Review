Abstract
The article is devoted to the assessment of one of the settlements resilient elements - green areas. It is the settlements greenery that fulfill a huge complex of ecosystem environmental services and functions. Several definitions of the settlement’s resilient are given. Further development of this scientific area is includes city resilient profiling and is carried out to compilation the object passport. The method of systematic analysis was applied to field data of structural features and functional zoning of cities in Russia and abroad. It allows us to identify the possibilities of green areas for determination of settlement resilient. The article gives a general view of relevant and up-to-date classification of green areas, which consists of 4 categories and 30 types. Each greening object is evaluated according to the author’s methodology, which includes an assessment of 31 indicators (e.g. debris on the land, area of disturbed land, the presence of unique species, the intensity of the load at survey time, etc.) Each greening object is evaluated according to the author’s methodology, which includes an assessment of 31 indicators (e.g. debris, area of disturbed land, the presence of unique species, the intensity of the load at survey time, etc.) and estimation of six classes of hemerobicity from normal to catastrophic. The total score of these indicators is the coefficient of the environmental situation. With this coefficient, it is possible: to assess the state; compare dynamics and objects, carry out remedial actions to reduce the class of hemorrhage and analyze the effectiveness of these actions. This indicator is a convenient tool for city logistics decisionmakers and public environmental organizations.
