The conservation of cultural heritage built of historical brick masonry alongside meeting targets in energy reduction will most likely require widespread installation of internal wall insulation (IWI). In London, traditional buildings (pre-1919) make up 40% of the existing stock and insulating from the interior is a likely retrofit solution for solid brick walls. Adding insulation may introduce a higher risk to moisture accumulation and consequences such as mould growth and material decay. To investigate resilience to future moisture loads, three interior insulation assemblies (conforming to two U-value guidelines) were simulated in DELPHIN under reference, near-future (2040), and far-future climate (2080) scenarios. Calcium silicate, phenolic foam, and wood fibre assemblies were simulated. The reference year climate file was compiled from observed data and future files developed using the UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). Assemblies were evaluated for moisture accumulation, mould growth risk, and freeze-thaw (FT) risk. Results show low-to-medium risks in 2040 and high risks in 2080, assemblies of higher absorptivity and thinner insulation comparatively performing best. The calcium silicate assembly fared best for moisture performance; however, all assemblies will be subject to high moisture risk levels in the far future and responsible retrofits must take this and alternative design solutions into account.
