Background: As industry and society move towards the second decade of the deluge of advanced technologies of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) age, introduced circa 2012, it is evident that the global economy continues to grapple with a plethora of ever-intensifying disruptions and vulnerabilities that inflict unexpected and uncontrolled damages on multiple organizational processes. These circumstances demand significant paradigm shifts, placing supply chain resilience (SCR) in the foreground of boardrooms and agendas of executive meetings. Method: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of selected articles that examine the intricate interplay of I4.0 and SCR under investment constraints. Employing a funnel approach, this study delves deeper into about a hundred papers that were initially selected from a pool of approximately four thousand publications on SCR. The study thoroughly analyzes the interconnection between SCR, I4.0, and investment (INV) while classifying these articles in a structured manner, based on industry type and focus. Results: The primary aim of the paper is to identify trends, gaps, and potential opportunities for future research on the SCR-I4.0-INV interplays. Conclusions: The findings reveal that industries are converging towards the implementation of digital technologies as a strategic move to tackle unexpected, unplanned, and undesired situations. This research illuminates the needs for organizations to prioritize supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions and vulnerabilities while highlighting the potential of digital technologies to enhance their resilience, therefore ensuring sustainable growth.
