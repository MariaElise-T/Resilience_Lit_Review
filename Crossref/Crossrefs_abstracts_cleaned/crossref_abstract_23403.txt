ABSTRACT Resilience is a subjective process related to both protective and risk factors, external and internal to the individual. Considering the psychosocial differences between young-onset dementia (YOD) and late-onset dementia (LOD) groups, carers’ resilience may not be understood in the same way in both groups.  Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the resilience of carers in YOD and LOD and to examine which factors might be associated with resilience in both groups of carers.  Methods: The study was conducted with 120 people with dementia (49 YOD) and their primary carers. The carers had their resilience, quality of life, depressive symptoms, and burden assessed and answered the sociodemographic questionnaire. We assessed care recipients’ global cognition, dementia severity, social cognition, facial expression recognition, awareness of disease, the ability to perform activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. For data analysis, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test and linear regressions were conducted.  Results: Resilience did not differ between groups (p=0.865). Resilience was inversely related to carers’ depressive symptoms in both YOD (p=0.028) and LOD (p=0.005) groups. The carers’ schooling (p=0.005), duration of disease (p=0.019), and depressive symptoms of care recipient (p<0.001) were related to carers’ resilience only in LOD group.  Conclusions: The context of care, clinical status of the care recipient, and mental health resources affected the carers’ resilience in the LOD group. Conversely, resilience seems to be affected only by carers’ mental health in the YOD group. The understanding of these differences is crucial for the developing of intervention strategies.
