Abstract

Background
To analyze whether people with low resilience are at higher risk of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish adults.


Methods
A longitudinal cohort study was carried out. Resilience was measured pre/post-pandemic with the CD-RISC. Mental health problems assessed were: Major Depressive Episode (MDE), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STB), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms.


Results
We found statistically significant differences between groups and resilience scores in MDE [F (3;48.40)=19.55], GAD [F(3;19.63)=6.45] and STB [F(3;111.74)=31.94]. Multivariable analyses showed individuals with very low resilience were at a 5-fold risk of Incidence of MDE and a 4-fold risk of STB. Persistent group presented a 21-fold risk of MDE and 54-fold risk of STB, respectively. No evidence of higher risk was found for GAD. Individuals with low resilience and exposed to COVID-19 did not have a significantly higher risk. Individuals with low resilience were at higher risk of PTSD in general population [β(95%CI)= -3.25(-3.969 to -2.54)], but not for individuals with COVID-19.


Conclusions
In the general population, having low or very low resilience increases the risk of suffering MDE, STB, and PTSD, but not GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not in the population with COVID-19.


Key messages
• Resilience was a buffer of mental health problems in general population, but not in those exposed to COVID-19.
• Those with low resilience were at 21-fold risk of mental health problems before and during the first year of pandemic.
