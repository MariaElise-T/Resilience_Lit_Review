Abstract
Coastal areas are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly the sustainability and resilience of the coastal residences. Surabaya as a coastal city in Indonesia is not an exception in facing the significant challenges. By developing an advanced high water modelling, it could predict the impacts of high-water levels on coastal residences. The spatial and temporal patterns of flooding events are analysed, allowing for the identification of vulnerable areas. This study shows the coastal residence in Surabaya City and their potential to be affected by tidal flooding based on the high resolution satellite imagery and actual Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The result shows that an area with no barrier to separate the residential area with the sea has a bigger chance to be affected by tidal flooding. In this research, the study locations are divided into northern, middle, and southern locations. It shows that the southern location is the most vulnerable residence with possibility water intrusive as far as 10 meters far from High Water Level (HWL) reference. With an accurate position of the HWL coastline, the development of settlements and coastal areas is expected to be better and safer, especially from the tidal floods.
