Child resilience is viewed as the capacity to use internal and external resources to successfully master stage-specific developmental issues. Smith and Carlson (1997) concluded that resilience can be described in three ways: 1) equated with coping, defined as efforts to restore or maintain equilibrium in the presence of significant stress; 2) conceptualized as the ability to recover in the face of trauma; and 3) defined as protective factors or mechanisms that mediate the relationship between risk and competency.
