Purpose
This paper aims to comment on resilience research within the context of frontline employees in sales and services marketing.


Design/methodology/approach
This commentary is a reflection based on my research, extant academic and managerial literature and personal perspectives.


Findings
Research findings show resilience is associated with increased employee effort and reduced turnover intentions in customer-facing roles. In addition, resilience can change over time and is not just a trait the employee is born with (or not). Hence, managers can cultivate resilience in employees.


Practical implications
Resilience cannot be purchased. Instead, managers can inspire resilience in frontline employees by developing their feelings of self-efficacy on the job, a sense of belongingness to the organization and peers and a sense of purpose and relatedness to customers.


Social implications
Resilience is not merely perseverance or grit; it is overcoming adversity and bouncing back to become better in the process. Thus, resilience is an important construct to study, particularly in customer-facing roles.


Originality/value
This commentary offers a unique approach to understanding resilience, its outcomes and its antecedents in customer-facing roles.
