AbstractThe reliability of energy storage by using a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) was evaluated. LOHC systems consist of a number of components and can be divided into two different strands for charging and discharging. This is important in terms of system reliability, because most potential causes of failure only lead to partial loss of functionality. The different components are discussed in terms of the respective causes of the failure, consequences, mitigation, and recovery strategies to draw a conclusion on the resilience of the system. On the basis of the probability of different failures and the mean times to repair, the availability of LOHC systems could be estimated quantitatively. The mean times for main relevant failure causes ranged from 4000 to 60 000 h. It was calculated that full functionality and partial functionality could be provided for more than 97 and approximately 98 % of the operational times, respectively.
