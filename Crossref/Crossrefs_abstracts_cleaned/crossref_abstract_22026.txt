The dense river network and large population in the southern region of China are vulnerable to flooding stress, which challenges the construction of human settlements. This paper analyzes the causes of flood risk and the dilemma of human settlement improvement in river-network cities, introduces the principle of resilience to human settlements, and conducts a quantitative study on the resilience of human settlements in river-network cities with the goal of flood risk management. Taking Yueyang city, a river-network city in the Yangtze River Basin, as the empirical research object, we conduct a flood resilience zoning of the human settlements based on the flood risk assessment model and use the GIS spatial overlay method to correct the resilience of the current human living space against the territorial spatial planning of Yueyang city. Ultimately, we propose a strategy for optimizing human settlements under flood risk management. The results show that (1) the highest-risk and high-risk areas of Yueyang city were mainly located in Dongting Lake and its interconnected water system, the southwest local area and the southeastern fringe, while the low-risk and lowest-risk areas were mainly located in the northeast local area and the northwestern fringe, with low flood stress risk. (2) The spatial system of human settlement resilience was constructed based on the flood risk assessment level. Among them, the human settlement flood resilience zoning of Yueyang city was divided into five categories from low to high: human settlement control zone, restriction zone, buffer zone, construction zone and expansion zone; the flood resilience zoning of Yueyang cityâ€™s current living space was divided into three categories from low to high: structure adjustment zone, flood restriction zone and development stability zone. (3) The specific control implementation and execution of the human settlements in Yueyang city mainly focus on the interrelationship between the risk of flooding in the watershed and the development of human activities through zoning regulation and collaborative management to optimize the human settlements. The study results can provide positive intervention and guidance for constructing urban and rural territorial spatial prevention planning and improving human living quality in river-network cities in China.
