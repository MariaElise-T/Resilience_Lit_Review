AbstractThe present study examined the longitudinal relations of adolescents' self‐reported ego‐resiliency to their emotional self‐efficacy beliefs in expressing positive emotions and in managing negative emotions as they moved into early adulthood. Participants were 239 females and 211 males with a mean age of 17 years (SD = .80) at T1, 19 years (SD = .80) at T2, 21 years (SD = .82) at T3, and 25 years (SD = .80) at T4. A four‐wave cross‐lagged regression model and mediational analyses were used. In a panel structural equation model controlling for the stability of the constructs, reciprocal relationships across time were found between ego‐resiliency and emotional self‐efficacy beliefs related to the expression of positive emotions and to the management of negative emotions. Moreover, the relation between ego‐resiliency assessed at T1 and T3, and ego‐resiliency assessed at T2 and T4, was mediated through emotional self‐efficacy beliefs (at T2 and T3, respectively), and vice versa. The posited conceptual model accounted for a significant portion of variance in ego‐resiliency and has implications for understanding the development of ego‐resiliency.
