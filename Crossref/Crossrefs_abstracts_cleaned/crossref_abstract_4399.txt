 In the absence of published quantitative data on resilience and mental health in the UK urology trainees, this paper analyses the 2018 and 2021 General Medical Council National Training Surveys with regard to the outcomes of seven work-related questions for all trainees and at all stages of training. The answers to these questions are used as a proxy for burnout levels in urology trainees and also to understand the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on training. In addition, the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that may influence a urological trainee’s performance are reviewed as these can act as negative drivers on personal and professional performance. The use of a trainee’s reflective practice and emotional intelligence are promoted to allow early diagnosis of burnout and prompt institution of viable treatment options.  Level of evidence: 2b
