Background: Resilience represents one of the fundamental elements of attachment and has often been investigated in mood disorders. This study aims to investigate possible correlations between attachment and resilience in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: 106 patients (51 MDD, 55 BD) and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were administered the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and Experiences in Close Relationship (ECR). Results: MDD and BD patients did not significantly differ from each other according to the HAM-D-21, HAM-A, YMRS, SHAPS, and TAS, while they scored higher than HCs on all these scales. Patients in the clinical group scored significantly lower on CD-RISC resilience than HCs (p < 0.01). A lower proportion of secure attachment was found among patients with MDD (27.4%) and BD (18.2%) compared to HCs (90%). In both clinical groups, fearful attachment prevailed (39.2% patients with MDD; 60% BD). Conclusions: Our results highlight the central role played by early life experiences and attachment in participants with mood disorders. Our study confirms the data from previous research showing a significant positive correlation between the quality of attachment and the development of resilience capacity, and supports the hypothesis that attachment constitutes a fundamental aspect of resilience capacity.
