The subjective approach (system-subject approach) and system ecological theory served as theoretical guidelines. The content of the metasystem concept of resilience is substantiated and disclosed, its components are identified. The problems of adolescence and the possibility of studying a multicomponent construct, its role in social adaptation are discussed in detail. Multimethodic studies conducted on adolescents of three groups are described: senior schoolchildren in general education schools, special schools for adolescents with deviant behavior and orphans. Features of adaptive and disadaptive adolescents, teenagers-orphans, characteristic for their level of resilience and social interactions are shown.
