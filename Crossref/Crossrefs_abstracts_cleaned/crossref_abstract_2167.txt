 In this article, I use a personal narrative case study approach to describe how the evolution of the Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) program at one Canadian hospital is informed by the model of a “care ecology,” and how we designed our program to generate resilience and sustainability systemically and structurally, rather than relying on the self-care efforts of individuals. I will also reflect on the leader behaviours required to enable a care ecology, and how this challenges traditional approaches to leadership. This model may be adapted to other high-stress teams to promote longitudinal well-being for healthcare professionals and leaders, as well as quality care for patients and families.
