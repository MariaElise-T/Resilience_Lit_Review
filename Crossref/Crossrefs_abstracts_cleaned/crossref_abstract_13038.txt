PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to algorithmically and objectively investigate the previous literature on supply chain resilience (SCR) and advance theory by synthesizing new research domains.Design/methodology/approachA two-staged analysis approach, integrating systematic literature review (SLR) with VOSviewer co-occurrence analysis, was applied to the articles published between 2003 and 2018.FindingsThe authors find exponential growth in the literature on SCR over the last decade; however, there is still a gap for empirical research on numerous drivers, barriers, theories, moderators, mediators and research methods intertwined in building SCR.Research limitations/implicationsThe review identifies major clusters in which SCR research is conducted and devises a future research agenda based on the findings of co-occurrence analysis.Practical implicationsThe findings provide managers with a broad spectrum of factors that are indispensable to build resilience and inform business policy.Originality/valueWhile some SLRs exist in the current literature of SCR, the authors undertake a unique analytical perspective, resulting in an idiosyncratic set of research domains for further investigation in the area.
