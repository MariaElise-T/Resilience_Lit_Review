PurposeThe role of brand management in contemporary organizations is very important and consistently growing due to the increasingly difficult competitive conditions on the market. Moreover, the significance of organizational resilience in this process should be noticed, especially in the times of emerging crises. In this context, the purpose of this article is to examine the mediating role of organizational resilience in the relation between brand performance and organizational performance.Design/methodology/approachIn order to verify the potential relations, empirical studies were conducted in 268 organizations located in Poland. The CAWI method was used in this research, while the companies were selected on the basis of the purposive manner. The reliability of the scales used in the survey was tested and afterwards the mediation model was built, confirming the presumed relationships between the variables. The calculations were made using the PS Imago Pro and Process macro for SPSS ver. 3.4 by Andrew F. Hayes.FindingsIt has been proven that organization's resilience partially mediates the relationship of brand performance and organizational performance.Research limitations/implicationsFirst of all, the scope of the research covered only Poland, and the obtained results may differ between countries with diversified market characteristics. Second of all, the study was not carried out in a representative manner, it concerned 268 companies that were selected based on the purposive method. Third of all, consideration focused only on one feature â€“ organizational resilience. It would be valuable to include other features to discussion. Finally, the research was conducted in December 2019, so it seems justified to repeat the survey in conditions of modern reality.Originality/valueThis study is the first that showed the relationship between brand performance and organizational resilience and its meaning for organizational performance.
