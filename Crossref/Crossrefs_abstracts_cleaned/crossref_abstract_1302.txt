Evaluating the resiliency of power systems against abnormal operational conditions is crucial for adapting effective actions in planning and operation. This paper introduces the level-of-resilience (LoR) measure to assess power system resiliency in terms of the minimum number of faults needed to produce a system outage (blackout) under sequential topology attacks. Four deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based agents: deep Q-network (DQN), double DQN, the REINFORCE (Monte-Carlo policy gradient), and REINFORCE with baseline are used to determine the LoR. In this paper, three case studies based on IEEE 6-bus test system are investigated. The results demonstrate that the double DQN network agent achieved the highest success rate, and it was the fastest among the other agents. Thus, it can be an efficient agent for resiliency evaluation.
