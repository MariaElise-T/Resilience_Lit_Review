Cellular identity,  developmental reorganization, genomic  structure modulation, and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases  involve epigenomic regulation engaging multiple signaling interplay. Here we demonstrate  that elovanoids (ELVs), mediators derived from  very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  acids (VLC-PUFAs, n-3, C >28),  and their precursors in human neurons/astrocytes in culture overcome  the damage triggered by oligomeric amyloid-β (OAβ), erastin (ferroptosis-dependent cell death), or other insults  like uncompensated oxidative  stress (UOS), NMDA mediated cellular excitotoxicity, or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), that target epigenomic signaling. We uncover that ELVs counteract damage targeting histones H3K9 and H3K27 methylation and  acetylation; tau hyperphosphorylation (pThr181, pThr217, pThr231, and pSer202/pThr205 (AT8));  senescence gene programming (p16INK4a, p27KIP, p21CIP1,  and p53); and DNA methylation (DNAm) modifying enzymes: TET (DNA hydroxymethylase), DNA methyltransferase, DNA demethylase, and DNA methylation (5mC) phenotype. Moreover, ELVs revert  OAβ-triggered telomere length (TL) attrition as well as upregulation of telomerase reverse  transcriptase (TERT) expression fostering dendrite protection and neuronal survival. Thus,  ELVs modulate epigenomic resiliency by pleiotropic interrelated signaling.
