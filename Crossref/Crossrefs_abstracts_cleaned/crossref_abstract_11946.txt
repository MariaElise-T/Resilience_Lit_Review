This article aims to show the development of positive and effective adaptation skills in decision-making only if emotional intelligence and resilience construction with appropriate stress management is achieved. This study uses validated psychometric tests, such as Baronâ€™s Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQI), to measure emotional intelligence and the Wagnild and Young (RS) resilience scale to measure resilience. The research approach is qualitative and applied with a design of non-experimental analysis. A stratified sample of agents of the city was made in three sectors: Rulers / Politicians, University Professors / Academics, and Businesspeople, as institutional decision-makers in the city of Arequipa. The low individual and collective construction of emotional intelligence and resilience in the different strata of the city of Arequipa significantly decreases adaptive capacity, so agents tend to make linear decisions in complex environments that affect their stress levels and uncertainty management. This study has not been done before since it develops and explains how agents and individuals are recognized as essential elements to generate value from the construction of emotional intelligence and resilience, linking them as fundamental constructs to positive adaptation or effective decision-making to the changing environment forming intelligent networks.
