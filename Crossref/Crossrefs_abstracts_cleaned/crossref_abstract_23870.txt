The purpose of this study is to identify the challenges faced by groups that are vulnerable to disasters during a pandemic by developing criteria to measure disabilities in daily life, social support, and resilience in elderly people during a pandemic. To this end, prior research was reviewed, and a focus group interview was conducted with elderly people. After analyzing the responses of the interview, the results of the measurement tools were organized and used to conduct a survey with 140 senior people living in Korea. The collected data was used to verify the reliability and validity of the criteria. As a result of the analysis, the criteria to examine difficulties in daily life included disorders in complying with hygiene practices, participating in outside activities, receiving vaccination, and psychological disorders. The criteria for social support consisted of emotional support, informational support, and material support, and those for resilience were composed of emotional intelligence, financial ability, problem-solving skills, and ability to request help. The criteria are expected to serve as a useful tool for examining the daily life of vulnerable people during a pandemic and providing systematic support when infectious disease outbreaks are predicted or occurring.
