The URL addresses listed here access websites holding an array of electronic resources relevant to the understanding of harm, abuse, agency and resilience across the lifespan. Many websites include links to additional reports, research papers, reviews and other sources of information. Due to the breadth of subject area and limitations on available space, the websites should be regarded as an indicative sample rather than an exhaustive list of relevant information currently available on the internet. Only English language sites have been included. All website addresses were available on 31 July 2009.
