AbstractObjectivesDental education is perceived as a source of students’ psychological and occupational stress. Resilience has been proposed as a protective factor that may support students’ in managing that stress. The objectives of this study were twofold: to map the mental health and well‐being content in the curriculum of the Faculty of Dentistry (FoD) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and to investigate factors influencing resilience levels amongst dental students at UBC.MethodsThe curricular database and website of UBC's FoD were used to gather information on mental health content. A survey with the Connor‐Davidson 10‐Item Resilience Scale was distributed to dental students at UBC (N = 289). Students' de‐identified demographic data were also collected.ResultsTwo main mental health and well‐being curricular components were identified: one didactic session on stress management and one interactive workshop on resilience. The response rate for the survey was 68.2%. Students who did not receive any mental health content (2020/21 year 1 students) had higher resilience scores (p = .043) when compared to students who received both components (2019/20 year 1 students and 2018/19 year 2 students). The multiple regression analysis highlighted North American/European ethnic origins as a predictor for higher resilience levels (p = .008).ConclusionsThe results of this study showed that ethnic origins and major life events, such as the pandemic, influenced resilience. Curricular activities promoting resilience seemed to not necessarily impact students' resilience. Further longitudinal studies are needed to assess the curricular and non‐curricular activities influence over dental students' well‐being.
