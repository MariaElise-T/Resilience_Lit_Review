Objectives The purpose of this study is to validate whether a gratitude program, developed as part of the psychological and emotional support program for children utilizing community child centers, has a positive effect on the grateful disposition, resilience, school and social adaptability of the children. Methods This study analyzed the group differences in the levels of grateful disposition, resilience, school and social adaptability between the experimental group consisting of 53 participants who participated in the gratitude program, and the control group composed of 50 participants who participated in the existing psychological and emotional program, among children using community child centers. The levels of grateful disposition, resilience, school and social adaptability were measured before and after the intervention, and the analysis was conducted using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results The results of the analysis, controlling for the pre-test scores of the experimental and control groups, showed that there was a significant increase in grateful disposition, resilience, school and social adaptability among the children who participated in the gratitude program. Particularly, notable findings include a significant increase in resilience and significant group differences in various aspects. The gratitude program demonstrated a positive impact on grateful behaviors, peer relationships, social activities, as well as cooperation and stability. Conclusions The expansion of community child center programs, which have primarily focused on caregiving and basic academic support, to include psychological and emotional support programs has been emphasized. In this context, a gratitude program was developed, placing a stronger emphasis on a proactive form of the positive psychological element, gratitude. The gratitude program has been found to not only improve psychological factors such as grateful disposition and resilience but also enhance adaptive factors such as school and social adaptability.
