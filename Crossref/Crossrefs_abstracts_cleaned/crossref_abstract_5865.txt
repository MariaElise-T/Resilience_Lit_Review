Abstract
This analysis examines the opioid crisis in the United States as a significant public health challenge. It highlights the increasing prevalence of opioid misuse and overdose-related deaths over the past two decades, emphasizing the need for innovative and adaptive public health approaches to effectively address the crisis's root causes, mitigate its impacts, and support recovery for those affected. The inquiry focuses on resilience as a key concept in public health, exploring its relevance and application in responding to the opioid crisis. Resilience, understood as the capacity of individuals, communities, and systems to adapt and respond effectively to adversity, is presented as vital for enhancing public health preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. The goal of the article is to provide insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on how to build resilience into public health systems and interventions to better confront the challenges posed by the opioid crisis.
