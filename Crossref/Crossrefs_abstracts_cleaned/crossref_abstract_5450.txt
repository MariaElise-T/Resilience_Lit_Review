Research related to resilience in the supply chain has taken great interest in recent years, especially due to major disruptions such as COVID-19. Generating actions to minimize the impacts caused by these disruptive events has become a paramount in operations management and has become a strategic capability of the supply chain. Therefore, it is essential to know how the concept of resilience has evolved by identifying their capabilities. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was carried out, focused on gathering the concepts of resilience in supply chain management present in the literature, generating a keyword correlation analysis to establish their action approaches, and jointly analyzing the conceptual evolution. From this literature, a new definition is proposed integrating the different aspects found. Finally, conclusions are exposed.
