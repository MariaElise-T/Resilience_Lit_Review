Urban resilience is a critical concept in the face of increasing challenges that cities encounter. This paper explores the concept of urban resilience, the factors influencing it, and measures to improve it. Urban resilience refers to a city's ability to withstand, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses while maintaining essential functions and overall well-being. Factors influencing urban resilience include social cohesion, inclusivity, economic diversity, sustainable infrastructure, environmental sustainability, effective governance, and community engagement. To enhance urban resilience, cities can undertake measures such as conducting risk assessments, incorporating resilience into urban planning, investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting social cohesion and community engagement, supporting economic diversification and sustainability, leveraging technology and innovation, and strengthening governance structures and partnerships. These measures aim to build cities that can effectively respond to challenges, reduce vulnerabilities, and foster sustainable and inclusive development. By embracing the concept of urban resilience and implementing these improvement measures, cities can create resilient urban environments that are well-prepared for the uncertainties of the future.
