The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected various sectors, including agriculture. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of smallholder farmers in Morocco's Fez-Meknes and Marrakesh-Safi regions regarding the potential effects of the pandemic on agricultural systems and the adoption of agroecological practices during the lockdown. The findings showed that farmers implemented diverse agroecological practices such as intercropping, organic fertilization, and local seed usage. However, the pandemic negatively affected the regular course of ag-ricultural practices of 51.6% of the participants. The majority expressed concerns about market closures, labor availability, access to agricultural materials, and fertilizers. Farmers with more than two hectares of land were the most affected and less likely to embrace agroecological practices, whereas those with less than two hectares continuously adopted these practices and were less affected by COVID-19. Although 54.7% of the respondents reported no changes in their dependence on agroecological practices, 41.1% indicated that this dependency increased after the COVID-19 crisis. Understanding farmers' behavior during the pandemic can inform future agricultural policies that prioritize healthy and sustainable food production. This study underscores the importance of investing in agriculture and building resilience to ensure sustainable food systems in the face of future crises.
