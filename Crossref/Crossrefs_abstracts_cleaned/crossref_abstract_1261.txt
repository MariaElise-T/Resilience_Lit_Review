This paper draws on the successful experience from domestic and abroad researches, testing repeatedly of powder subgrade with load triaxial tests, analyzing the relationship between the subgrade soil resilient modulus, deviatoric stress, water content and degree of compaction. At the same time, conducting corresponded roadbed soil resilient modulus forecast model, and qualifying its correctness of test data model.
