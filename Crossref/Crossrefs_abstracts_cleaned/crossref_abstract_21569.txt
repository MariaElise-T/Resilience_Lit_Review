 This study explored the relationship between emotional control, resilience, and mental health in cancer. Patients with cancer were recruited ( n = 170). Courtauld Scale of Emotional Control, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the General Health Questionnaire were selected. Assuming the absence of interaction among the variables, they were analyzed separately. Four groups resulted, finding statistically significant differences ( F(4, 165) = 18.03; p < 0.001). High resilience and low emotional control seem to be protective attributes, and high emotional control has demonstrated to be a risk factor for mental health. Considering differences in cancer-related psychological variables could derive in personalized psychotherapeutic interventions.
