PurposeThis report aims to present a detailed evaluation of resilience planning of the ASEAN-5 tourism sector to national disasters. The project analyses the challenges to the tourism industry in the ASEAN-5 (Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia) countries due to national disasters (economic crisis, health hazards, natural calamity and/or act of terrorism) and the effectiveness of the measures taken in response to disastrous events.Design/methodology/approachThe project analyses the effect of national disasters over a 10-year period in the ASEAN-5 countries on tourism economy and effectiveness of government action in resilience planning. The study uses two research questions to comment on comparative effectiveness of resilience planning in the ASEAN-5 nations.FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that national disasters affect a county’s tourism sector performance and its economy negatively. In particular, national disasters have harmful effects for a country’s tourism arrivals, tourism receipts, gross domestic product and unemployment. The findings reveal that regardless of geographical closeness of the ASEAN-5 countries, each experienced different effects in terms of national disasters and each used different government recovery measures.Practical implicationsThis paper builds a knowledge management system for national disasters and the tourism sector. It provides a ready reference of timeliness and effectiveness of measures and to develop a framework for future tourist disaster management systems. Specifically, the relationships between the tourism indicators explored in this study contribute significantly to the knowledge on how these indicators interact to affect the tourism industry and the country’s economy. Furthermore, this information would act as a guide for countries to design and implement resilience planning and disaster management response.Originality/valueResilience planning is emerging as a key area under sustainable development. This report presents an evaluation of resilience planning of the ASEAN-5 tourism sector to national disasters.
