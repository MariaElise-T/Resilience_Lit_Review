The more severe acoustic requirements imposed by the new Belgian standard for dwellings are a real challenge for the building professionals (architects, contractors, building elements manufacturers and suppliers, Å“) and more particularly for the market of lightweight materials. An important brick producer in partnership with the BBRI has succeeded to propose efficient acoustic solutions for these kinds of materials by treating in particular the flanking transmission. Indeed, to obtain high sound insulations, the structural transmission paths of noise through the flanking walls cannot be neglected any more. By the application of resilient rubber interlayers at the junctions, these transmission paths are nearly eliminated. A large number of measurements was carried out in order to study in detail the effect of these flexible joints on the sound transmission. These measurements were made in a specially designed laboratory where vibration reduction indexes can be measured for all types of connections and for different loads. We present, in this paper, the measurement campaign and the analysis of the results.
