The article presents the results of a psychological survey of 90 employees, who determined the level of organizational stress and a degree of development of two professionally important qualities - stress tolerance and resilience.  Three psychodiagnostic methods were used: 1) K. McLean scale of organizational stress in N. Vodopyanova's adaptation; 2) the method of studying stress tolerance as a socio-psychological quality of a person; 3) S. Muddy test of resilience.  It was found that about 75% of employees deferred by a low overall level of organizational stress and at the same time they had a high level of stress tolerance and resilience; 17% of employees demonstrated a high level of organizational stress, 6% of which was characterized by a low level of stress tolerance.  The consistent patterns are established as a result of the correlation analysis: the more active and productive an employee is, the higher his resilience and vice versa; the older the employee, the lower his control indicator; with increasing work experience, flexibility in employee behavior increases.  The results of a comparative analysis by gender mark significant differences in the overall level of stress tolerance (higher among women) and the ability of self-knowledge (more developed among men).  The psychological conditions for increasing stress tolerance and resilience on an individual level, as well as social and psychological conditions for reducing organizational stress are described.
