A review of scientific publications aimed at determining the basis for the formation of the resili-ence paradigm in the security sphere is provided. The main stages of the evolution of the resili-ence paradigm in the context of security are considered, including its origin, development and multifactorial impact on the security of critical systems and infrastructures at different levels. The definitions, concepts, and key ideas underlying the paradigm are examined in detail, high-lighting the fundamental principles that contributed to its emergence. Special attention is paid to the constructs underlying the resilience paradigm in the security domain. Emphasis is placed on their practical implementation in frameworks and international legislation.
