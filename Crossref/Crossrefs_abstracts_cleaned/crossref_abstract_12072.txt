Taking into account Smart Grid creation, cyber security appears as critical problem. In spite of wide set of technical tools and organisational decisions, which use for protection of electrical objects against cyber attacks, it is impossible to prevent them completely. Therefore, the ability of Smart Grid to resist cyber attacks is important and necessary property. Thus, the cyber resilience is ability of complicate technical-information system to keep operable state under contingencies including cyber attacks. This paper deals with general problem of electric power system resilience and its cyber resilience, determination methods to calculate quantitative measure of Smart Grid resilience. The state estimation software resilience under cyber attacks is discussed.
