 Resilience at workplace has been identified as an essential attribute of employees which enables them to cope with challenges associated with the changing nature of modern businesses. Among the work and non-work factors that add up to these challenges for employees, family responsibility features as a very crucial factor that also plays a significant role in an employee’s career-related choices and outcomes. This study examines the impact of family responsibilities and perceived family support on an employee’s workplace resilience, probing further into their interaction effect. It also examines the effect of three demographic variables, namely employee’s age, gender and marital status on workplace resilience. Data were collected from more than 200 professionals from one of the major metropolises in India. The results show that the employee’s age has a significant main effect on workplace resilience. Multiple regression with interaction effect reveals that while family responsibility and perceived family support have a significant main effect, their interaction effect is insignificant.
