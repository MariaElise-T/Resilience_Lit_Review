Critical infrastructure is the basis of our modern life, and the resilience of critical infrastructure is a serious issue for maintaining our safe and secure society. After several remarkable events like terroristsâ€™ attack in US in 2001 and the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2012, a shared recognition that more comprehensive approaches for crisis management is necessary. For resilience enhancement of critical infrastructure, we have to understand the response of critical infrastructure to a crisis. Computer simulation is a promising approach for this purpose, but how to model interdependencies that exist among different sectors of infrastructure is a problem to be solved in resilience analysis of critical infrastructure using simulation. From this background, a modeling and simulation method of critical infrastructure considering interdependencies among different sectors were developed. The system consists of detailed models for separate sectors, and the integrated model including multiple sectors of critical infrastructure. The modeled sectors include electricity, gas, water supply, roads, and telephone networks in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. Sensitivity studies were conducted based on the 4R framework of resilience to examine the functionality of the simulation system. Finally, it has been shown that a human-centered viewpoint is essential for assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure.
