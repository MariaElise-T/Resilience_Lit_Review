Objective: To evaluate the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on psychological resilience, social adaptation and clinical efficacy in patients with bone tumors.
Methods: This is a retrospective study. Eighty patients with bone tumor admitted to Baoding No.1 Central Hospital were included and randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group, with 40 cases in each group from March 2020 to February 2022. Patients in the control group were given conventional specialist care, while those in the experimental group were given cognitive-behavioral therapy on top of the treatment in the control group. The differences in quality of life before and after treatment between the two groups were compared and analyzed.
Results: The levels of SAS and SDS were significantly lower in the experimental group compared to the control group, with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). The satisfaction level in the experimental group was higher than in the control group, with statistically significant difference (p=0.04). In addition, the psychological resilience scores of adaptability, toughness, control and goal achievement in the experimental group were significantly improved compared with those in the control group, with statistically significant differences (p<0.05); The cognitive scores in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, with statistically significant difference (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an effective regimen for patients suffering from bone tumors, boasting various benefits such as significantly enhanced patient compliance with treatment, improved quality of life, increased resilience, ameliorated anxiety and depressive states, and improved treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction.
