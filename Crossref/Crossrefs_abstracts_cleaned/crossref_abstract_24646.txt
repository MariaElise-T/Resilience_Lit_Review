The goal of the article is to outline general approaches to analyzing the resilience of supersystems. In technical and economic applications, the resilience of supersystems is analyzed based on fuzzyprobabilistic models, and these supersystems themselves have the characteristics of cybernetic systems in the models. If we apply the same scientific foundation to study organizational control systems within supersystems, we have a unified approach to analyzing the resilience of supersystems of any functional content and structural composition. One of the relevant models for analyzing the resilience of supersystems is the 4x6 matrix, where the enterprise cybernetic system is complemented by cybernetic systems of influences and decisions made based on the outcomes of these influences. The vast diversity of existing approaches to studying individual properties of supersystems (especially their resilience) calls for a comparative analysis of these approaches, their systematization, and determining the boundaries of their applicability. Scientific progress in the analysis of supersystem resilience can only be achieved through: a) continuous expansion of the research scope; b) unification of approaches to research, transitioning to a unified modeling language. We recognize that cybernetics and systems theory loom over our entire working space, dictating the same research standards for both supersystems and their individual properties (such as resilience), as well as the development of a unified system of measures.
