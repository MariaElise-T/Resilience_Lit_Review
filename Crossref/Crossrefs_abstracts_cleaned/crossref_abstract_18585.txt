The development of 5G has brought new opportunities for the application of Internet of Things (IoT). The integration of 5G and IoT technologies promote high availability, resilience, and reliability of the network infrastructures. IoT deployment optimization is the core issue of 5G IoT. Traditionally, IoT node deployment methods mostly used disk coverage model or probabilistic detection coverage model, which only utilizes the sensing capability of a single IoT node, which results in higher deployment costs. In this article, we study the network resilience of coverage estimation error and solve the coverage problem of resilient deployment of smart nodes in 5G IoT. The coverage formulation in the deployment optimization method is defined based on the confident information coverage (CIC). In order to obtain the optimal deployment with a given coverage quality and with a given budget, the mixed-integer linear programming models (CICILP-COST) and (CICILP-ERROR) are proposed based on the CIC model. After analyzing the model complexity, the proposed models are solved by the variable relaxation algorithm (CICVR-COST) and dichotomous search algorithm (CICDS-ERROR), respectively. Simulations on air pollution datasets in Lyon, France, show that the proposed model yields a lower cost optimal deployment than existing peer schemes.
