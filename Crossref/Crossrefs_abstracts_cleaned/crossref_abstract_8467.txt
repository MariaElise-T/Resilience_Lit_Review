The COVID-19 pandemic has created anxiety, depression and loss of existential meaning in local and global communities. It left behind children who bear the pain of losing their parents, siblings, relatives and friends while dealing with their sicknesses, including those that result from psychosocial stress, and/or contending with poverty. The problem is that children did not receive adequate psychosocial interventions that could contain their negative emotional experiences, help them to heal and build resilience that could enable them to deal with future adversities. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may manifest later in their lives. This paper investigated the use of storytelling to build learnersâ€™ resilience and restore their existential meaning Post-COVID-19 pandemic. This conceptual article has been designed within qualitative research and follows an interpretivist paradigm. Document analysis was employed to collect data. Documents reviewed indicated that there is limited research done on the effects of integrating bibliotherapy in learning processes. The article contends that classroom pedagogies should integrate storytelling to help children build resilience. This paper recommends storytelling as an innovative teaching strategy that could help young children build resilience. Therefore, the relationship between bibliotherapy and resilience has been discussed. The recommended strategy is premised on the understanding that when children are involved in storytelling that aligns with their cultures and experiences, it can foster change in cognitions and mobilise intrinsic and extrinsic assets that enable them to cope with adversities.
