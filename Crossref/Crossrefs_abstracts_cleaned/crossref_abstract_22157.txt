The development of transportation infrastructure can ensure the strong recovery and reconstruction function of a city, and it is an important way to build a resilient city. Studying the impact of the transportation infrastructure level on urban resilience is related to the future development of a city. Based on panel data for China’s three major urban agglomerations from 2008 to 2019, this paper uses the spatial econometric model to explore the spatial spillover effect of transportation infrastructure on urban resilience. The results show that, due to its spillover effect, intra-regional transportation infrastructure promotes the urban resilience of cities around Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and the Pearl River Delta, while it only promotes the urban resilience of local cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Inter-regional transportation infrastructure not only inhibits the local urban resilience of Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei but also reduces the urban resilience of surrounding cities. However, the impact on the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta is not obvious. To promote the overall resilience level in three major urban agglomerations in China, this paper argues that it is urgently required to improve the quality of urban road traffic facilities and optimize the structure of intercity transportation to promote the development of transportation infrastructure and urban resilience. The implementation of several policies is recommended to efficiently improve the transportation infrastructure and urban resilience in these three major urban agglomerations in China.
