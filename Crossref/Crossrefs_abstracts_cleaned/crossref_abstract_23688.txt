Background: There are so many cases report with death anxiety in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Death anxiety leads toward various types of psychopathologies as well as numerous disorders. Excessive death anxiety also affects the resilience level of CKD patients. Objective: to find out the impact of death anxiety on resilience among patients with CKD moderating role of social support. Methodology: This study design was Correlational. The sample consists of n=150 patients with CKD. Data was collected from different hospitals of Multan, Bahawalpur, and Lodhran. The CKD patients with age range from 15 to 25 years diagnosed with stage 3-5 of chronic kidney diseases on hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation were included in the study. The Death Anxiety scale-Urdu Child and Youth Resilience Measure- Urdu and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Version-12 was used for data collection. Results: The correlation analysis among study variables shows that death anxiety has significant negative correlation (p<0.01) with resilience (r=-0.55). The overall model explained the 44% of variance with F=57.08(2,147), p<0.001 for resilience, whereas in step 2, social support was found significant predictor (R2=41, B=0.39, β=0.64, p<0.01) of resilience and moderator between death anxiety and resilience. From step 3, death anxiety was similarly established significant negative predictor (R2=47, B=-0.24, β=-0.33, p<0.01) of resilience. Additionally, in step 4, the interaction of death anxiety and social support was found significant for resilience (R2= 49, B=-0.01, β=-0.56, p<0.01. Conclusion: there is a negative relationship between death anxiety and resilience. Social support significantly moderates the relationship between death anxiety and resilience.
