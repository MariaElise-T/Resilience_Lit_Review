AbstractStress can promote the development of psychiatric disorders, though some individuals are more vulnerable to stress compared to others who are more resilient. Here we show that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats regulates resilience to chronic social defeat stress. S1PR3 expression is elevated in the mPFC of resilient compared to vulnerable and control rats. Virally-mediated over-expression of S1PR3 in the mPFC produces a resilient phenotype whereas its knock-down produces a vulnerable phenotype, characterized by increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and these effects are mediated by TNFÎ±. Furthermore, we show that S1PR3 mRNA in blood is reduced in veterans with PTSD compared to combat-exposed control subjects and its expression negatively correlates with symptom severity. Together, these data identify S1PR3 as a regulator of stress resilience and reveal sphingolipid receptors as important substrates of relevance to stress-related psychiatric disorders.
