AbstractUrban kampung is an urban settlement with a community that indicates the characteristics of “vulnerability” and adaptability at the same time. The vulnerabilities of their existence rely from internal and external pressures which consist of chronic stresses (the community’s limitations to fulfil their daily needs) and acute shocks (sudden threats that emerges from outside the community). Simultaneously their vulnerabilities are strengthened by community-based adaptations as a respond of kampung residents towards these pressures. This paper discusses spatial adaptations done by residents of Kampung Muka, North Jakarta as a respond to limitation of clean water provision and sanitation facilities. We utilize qualitative methods consist of site observation along with an interview with the locals. We employ Resilience Assessment as a guiding tool to investigate vulnerabilities, adaptations, and resilience of urban kampung. This guide incorporates the adaptive cycle model to study how the system changes over time, following a pattern of four phases which incorporate both long-term and short-term challenges in the context of water infrastructure from the historical and current point of view. Adaptive capacity shown in urban kampung indicates potential resilience in their community, which could be developed and implemented in a larger urban scale.
