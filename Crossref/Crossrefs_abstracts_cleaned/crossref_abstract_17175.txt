The goal of this qualitative study was to examine the strengths and posttraumatic growth experiences of a community of female refugees from Burma resettled in a Midwestern city of the United States. Based on data gathered from eleven participants, consensual qualitative research analysis yielded a thematic overview of two domains: (a) coping and resilience, and (b) experiences of posttraumatic growth. The results provided contextual evidence to the preresettlement and postresettlement stressors experienced by Burmese refugee women in resettlement. Findings also highlight the strengths, protective factors, and resources of Burmese refugee women, whose narratives of positive growth and change seem to coexist with memories and experiences of trauma, suffering, and hardship. Implications for research and clinical practice as well as future directions are discussed.
