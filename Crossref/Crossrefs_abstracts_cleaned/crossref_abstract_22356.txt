AbstractAimTo investigate the long‐term psychological reactions and resilient process of the young survivors after a large‐scale burn disaster of the Formosa Color Dust Explosion in Taiwan.DesignLongitudinal study with follow‐up interviews using standardized questionnaire during November 2015–June 2018.MethodsThe burn survivors received structured assessment in the four‐wave interviews including the five‐item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, nine‐item Concise Mental Health Checklist, and two‐item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms and suicide risk assessment. Post‐traumatic psychological symptoms were assessed through the four‐item Startle, Physiological Arousal, Anger, and Numbness Scale, and six‐item Impact of Event Scale.FindingsThe response rates were 65.1%, 74.2%, 76.9%, and 78.5% across the four‐wave interviews among 484 burn survivors. The participants were mean‐aged 23.1 years with just over half having 40% or more burn wounds in total body surface area. The respondents at each wave were similar in gender, age, and per cent of total body surface area burned. In the first 2 years of recovery, the respondents showed resilience in coping with stress of trauma under family and social support. While there was a decreasing trend of psychological symptoms over the first 2 years, hypnotic use and alcohol consumption remained at about 10% in the final interview, which were accompanied by psychological symptom recurrence.ConclusionYoung burn survivors recovered both psychologically and physically under supportive care and personal resilience in 2 years after the burn event, yet post‐traumatic mental distress and coping efforts after 2 years during community reintegration should be detected and managed. Early prevention and detection of mental health deterioration is needed even after 2 years of burn disasters.ImpactThe study demonstrated post‐burn longitudinal changes on psychological reactions. Nursing staffs may help young burn survivors identify mental distress and stress management needs in the long‐term psychological adaptation process.
