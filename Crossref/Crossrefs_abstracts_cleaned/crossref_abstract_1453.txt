This study explores associations between scores on the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA), parent education level, and race/ethnicity in a normative sample of 450 children. Small but significant associations were found between parent education level and the RSCA Sense of Relatedness Scale score. Race/ethnicity did not contribute unique variance when parent education level was controlled.
