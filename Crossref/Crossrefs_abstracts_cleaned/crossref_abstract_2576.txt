Abstract A climate-resilient and eco-friendly maritime transport is the key to sustainable development. In response to the Paris Climate Accord, the International Maritime Organization has adopted strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by ~50% by 2050, compared
 to levels reported in 2008. The article reviews the ongoing efforts toward achieving clean, safe, and efficient marine transport. The transformation pathway requires sustained innovation, investment, and policy support in economic production and reliable supply for ammonia and hydrogen fuels,
 battery-based hybrid power systems for support vessels, artificial intelligence-enabled autonomous ships, energy-efficient and low-noise ship design, and improved operational planning.
