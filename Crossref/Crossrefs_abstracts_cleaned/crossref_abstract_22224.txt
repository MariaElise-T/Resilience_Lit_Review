BackgroundThe contribution of education and intelligence to resilience against
                           age-related cognitive decline is not clear, particularly in the presence
                           of ‘normal for age’ minor brain abnormalities.MethodParticipants (n = 208, mean age 69.2 years, s.d. = 5.4)
                           in the Whitehall II imaging substudy attended for neuropsychological
                           testing and multisequence 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Images
                           were independently rated by three trained clinicians for global and
                           hippocampal atrophy, periventricular and deep white matter changes.ResultsAlthough none of the participants qualified for a clinical diagnosis of
                           dementia, a screen for cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive
                           Assessment (MoCA) <26) was abnormal in 22%. Hippocampal atrophy, in
                           contrast to other brain measures, was associated with a reduced MoCA
                           score even after controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, years
                           of education and premorbid IQ. Premorbid IQ and socioeconomic status were
                           associated with resilience in the presence of hippocampal atrophy.ConclusionsIndependent contributions from a priori risk (age,
                           hippocampal atrophy) and resilience (premorbid function, socioeconomic
                           status) combine to predict measured cognitive impairment.
