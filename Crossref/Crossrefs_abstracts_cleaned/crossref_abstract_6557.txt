Introduction: The purpose of this study was to investigate the causal-structural relationship of cognitive bias and resiliency with depression in infertile people considering  the mediating role of  general anxiety.
Methods: This descriptive correlational study was conducted based on the application of findings.  In order to conduct research among all infertile women who referred to infertility clinics in Yazd, 200 individuals were selected through a convenient sampling method. To collect data, focused cognitive bias questionnaires, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (Short Form), and Spitzer et al. Inclusive Scale Anxiety Scale were used.  Structural Equation Modeling method was also applied to analyze the data.
Results: The findings showed that high cognitive bias and low resilience were effective in incidence of depression and anxiety among infertile people. In other words, higher cognitive bias and lower resilience increased depression and general anxiety in infertile people.  Moreover, the conceptual model designed in the research was fitted using structural equation method.
Conclusion: Findings showed that cognitive bias in infertile people predicts resilience, which is an effective factor in changing the rate of general anxiety and depression.  In addition, general anxiety plays an important role in predicting depression.
