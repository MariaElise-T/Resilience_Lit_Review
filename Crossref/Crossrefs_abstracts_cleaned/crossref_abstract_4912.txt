 The idea of resilience is increasingly prominent across a wide range of policy areas. This contribution looks at the emergence of resilience in UK security discourse and compares this with the situation in France.

This article suggests that use of the idea of resilience has more to do with particular forms of governance than with security. It develops this argument through the idea of neoliberal governmentality.
