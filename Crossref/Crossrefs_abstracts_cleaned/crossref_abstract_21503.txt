AbstractSelf-awareness and self-evaluation are at the heart of both core of self-assessment, self-efficacy, and grit tendencies. Although there is a lot written about self-assessment, self-efficacy, and grit tendencies, academic resilience, and motivation, very little is known about how self-assessment, self-efficacy, and grit tendencies contribute to the academic resilience and academic demotivation of the learners, especially in online English as a foreign language (EFL) assessment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate a structural model of core of self-assessment, self-efficacy, grit tendencies, academic resilience, and academic demotivation among EFL students. Consequently, 385 EFL students took surveys measuring their language-learning endeavors using the Core of Self-assessment Questionnaire (CSAQ), the Self-Efficacy Scale (S-ES), the language-domain-specific grit scale (L2-Grit S), the Academic Resilience Scale (ARS), and the Academic Demotivation Scale (ADS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) findings revealed that highly resilient and motivated EFL students had high core of self-assessment. Additionally, grit tendencies and self-efficacy displayed effectiveness in elevating academic resilience and motivation in online assessment. The results of this study may have worthwhile pedagogical implications for incorporating technologically enhanced learning and assessment into the classroom.
