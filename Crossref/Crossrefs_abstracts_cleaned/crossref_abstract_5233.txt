This paper describes an initial description of the resilient divertor properties of quasi-symmetric (QS) stellarators using the HSX (Helically Symmetric eXperiment) configuration as a test-case. Divertors in high-performance QS stellarators will need to be resilient to changes in plasma configuration that arise due to evolution of plasma pressure profiles and bootstrap currents for divertor design. Resiliency is tested by examining the changes in strike point patterns from the field line following, which arise due to configurational changes. A low strike point variation with high configuration changes corresponds to high resiliency. The HSX edge displays resilient properties with configuration changes arising from the (1) wall position, (2) plasma current, and (3) external coils. The resilient behavior is lost if large edge islands intersect the wall structure. The resilient edge properties are corroborated by heat flux calculations from the fully 3-D plasma simulations using EMC3-EIRENE. Additionally, the strike point patterns are found to correspond to high curvature regions of magnetic flux surfaces.
