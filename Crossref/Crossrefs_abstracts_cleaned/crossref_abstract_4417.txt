 This paper deals with the problem of carpet resilience which depends on pile yarn properties and carpet construction characteristics. Up to now, resilience could only be measured on the carpet itself. New methods are being developed to assess the resilience properties of pile yarns directly before carpet manufacturing. The test methods are explained and results discussed.
