Batu East Java, Indonesia, as a tourist city, is categorized as a disaster-prone area; hence city resilience should be improved. Increasing resilience has a function in protecting the city from the rising number of disaster risks. This study aims to analyze the regional capacity based on the Regional Disaster Management Agency (Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah – BPBD) capacity assessment criteria using the resilient stage based on Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MCR2030) and to determine the relationship between the BPBD capacity assessment criteria and the MCR2030 assessment. This study used a mixed methodology with a sequential explanatory design. The data collection technique involved 55 respondents using a purposive technique. The data analysis is based on the capacity assessment results in Batu City, which reached “moderate” criteria since the disaster risk index tends to decrease while the threat level rises. According to MCR2030, Batu City achieved 79.04% and was classified in stage C (progression implementation) because BPBD well defined the knowledge and planning stages for Batu City. This research indicated a significant gap between BPBD and other organizations, indicating that the “moderate” capacity and stage C categories only apply to BPBD. Other organizations, particularly in the economic and tourism sectors, are aware of the risks at stage B (planning) but have not yet developed a comprehensive plan or strategy to manage them. In contrast to the MCR2030 assessment, practically all respondents outside the BPBD stated that they had not participated in any regulations or public consultations in the past year and were unaware of such activities. The critical success of MCR2030 is the creation of resilience between stakeholders and local organizations; therefore, the suitability between the MCR2030 assessment and the capacity of BPBD can be used as a reference and adapted by other organizations, particularly the tourism industry in Batu City.
