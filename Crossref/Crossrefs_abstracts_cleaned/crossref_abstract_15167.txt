AbstractProblemPreventive and supportive nursing care interventions of school nurses are very important in the early adolescence period, in which the significant physical and sexual changes occur. One ramification of these changes may be social appearance anxiety. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of resilience on social appearance anxiety among early adolescents.MethodsThe study was a cross‐sectional design. The study data were collected between February and June 2018. Study sample consists of 495 early adolescents studying at a state secondary school in Turkey. The data were gathered using personal information form, Social Appearance Anxiety Scale (SAAS), and Child and Young Resilience Measure (CYRM‐12). The data were analyzed using the independent‐sample t test, one‐way analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression methods.FindingsIn the present study, the mean age of early adolescents was found to be 11.90 (1.07) years. The mean scores of students in SAAS and CYRM‐12 were 31.79 (13.30) and 52.96 (5.86), respectively. Social appearance anxiety scores of early adolescents were found to have a negative effect on the resilience levels (β = −0.294).ConclusionsIt can be suggested to teach adolescents, the interventions about the use of active coping skills aiming to decrease social appearance anxiety and to increase the resilience.
