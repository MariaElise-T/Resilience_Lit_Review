Abstract
South Africa is a carbon-intensive country, with coal dominating the indigenous energy resource base; however, targets have been set to reduce the national carbon emissions. The transition from coal to cleaner sources of energy generation can be encouraged by the administration of new technologies. Hence, the study aims to review research progress on the pyrolysis of water hyacinth as a tool for the smooth transition to low carbon and climate-resilient economy. Water hyacinth is suitable for energy recovery due to its high carbon content and heating value. The outcome shows that pyrolytic products such as liquid, char and non-condensable gas fractions are beneficial. This paper contributes to policy and research deliberations on promoting and adopting pyrolysis technology in addressing South Africaâ€™s energy crisis and water hyacinth invasion.
