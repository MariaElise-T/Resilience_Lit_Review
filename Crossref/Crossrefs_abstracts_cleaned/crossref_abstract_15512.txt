AbstractBackgroundCognitive resilience (CR) is defined as the capacity to sustain a better‐than‐expected cognitive performance based on pathological burden. There is high variability in the individuals’ CR, and it has been demonstrated that individuals with high resilience develop symptoms later than those with low CR. The aim of this study it to investigate the association between demographic and clinical features and individual CR.Method144 subjects from the Geneva memory center cohort (N=37 cognitively unimpaired, N=84 mild cognitive impairment, N=23 dementia) that underwent amyloid PET, tau PET and an extensive neuropsychological battery were included. A linear regression model between amyloid and tau global standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) vs Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed, and the residuals of the model were used as a measure of individual CR. A multivariate linear regression was used to assess the association between CR and age, sex, education, and white matter hyperintensities.ResultMean age was 72.2 (sd = 7.8), 72 were female (50%), and mean years of education was 13.9 (4.1). Greater CR was associated with better education (β = 0.26, p = 0.001), older age (β = 0.25, p = 0.002) and low white matter hyperintensities (β = ‐0.17, p = 0.037). No associations were observed between CR and gender (gender, β = 0.06, p = 0.455).ConclusionWe confirmed in our population that education is strongly associated with CR. Future development of this study will be to investigate brain resilience (BR), defined as the relationship between atrophy and amyloid and tau, and the longitudinal cognitive trajectory of the individuals with high BR and/or CR compared to those with low BR and/or CR. the definite article More (Definitions, Synonyms, Translation)
