A qualitative study was conducted to investigate the concept of resilience among Iranian haemophilic adolescents based on the Haaseâ€™s Resilience in Illness Model (RIM). Purposive sampling was used to recruit 15 participants comprising haemophilic adolescents and their parents in the study. The data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and analysed using direct content analysis. The themes and categories were defensive coping (emotive coping, evasive coping), courageous coping (optimism, constructive approach, seeking support), derived meaning (spiritual strategy, hope) and social support (support from family, friends and treatment teams). Social support, adopting a spiritual strategy and self-management behaviours played an important role among the adolescents in improving their level of resilience and skills to cope with haemophilia.
