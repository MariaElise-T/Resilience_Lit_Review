Objectives  The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence and ego resilience and to examine the mediating effect of ego resilience.
Methods  The subjects of this study were 244 children aged 4-5 years and one parent from J province and G city, and the data were analyzed using the SPSS 22.0 program. First, the correlation between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence and ego resilience was examined. Next, the mediating effect of ego resilience in the relationship between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence was analyzed.
Results  As a result of the study, first, as a result of examining the correlation between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence and ego resilience, it was found that there was a significant correlation between variables. In other words, there was a correlation between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence, parent-child interaction and ego resilience, and there was a correlation between young child’s emotional intelligence and ego resilience. Second, as a result of examining the mediating effect of ego resilience in the relationship between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence, it was found that ego resilience partially mediates the relationship between parent-child interaction and young child’s emotional intelligence. This can be explained by the fact that parent-child interaction not only directly affects the process of influencing the emotional intelligence of children, but also indirectly influences it through the medium of ego resilience.
Conclusions  In conclusion, it suggests that more practical studies on effective parent-child interaction are needed to enhance young child’s emotional intelligence and ego resilience.
