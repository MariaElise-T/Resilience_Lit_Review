This paper presents the results of multiproxy research (pollen, charcoal, plant macrofossil and testate amoebae) on the biogenic deposits core from Gorodetsky Moch, an ombrotrophic peatland in western Russia (Western Dvina Lakeland). We reconstructed the impact of disturbance on peatland development in the last 300 years by using chronology of the records based on14C and210Pb data set. The multiproxy reconstruction was compared with changes in the land cover using historical maps and Corona images, which provides a unique spatial analysis of past ecological and land-use changes. We aimed to determine the effect of local disturbances (drainage) and land-use changes (landscape openness) on the development of the peatland during the last 300 years. Our study suggests that human activity had a crucial impact on the development of the peatland in the last centuries. The analysis of testate amoebae and plant macrofossils revealed a clear disturbed layer in the second half of the 20th century CE. Most probably, the drainage of the peatland triggered changes in the community of testate amoebae and plants, thereby causing a functional shift in Sphagnum peatland ecosystem. The hydrological stress and vegetation composition shift led to the collapse of mixotrophic testate amoebae. However, the peatland showed strong resilience and recovered toward the end of the 20th century CE and the beginning of the 21st century CE, despite the lower water table. Our study shows an example of the peatland ecosystem that experienced a considerable stress but finally sustained the former function.
