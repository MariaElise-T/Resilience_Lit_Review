ABSTRACT

Introduction
Some of the obstacle Course Race (OCR) competitions are co-organized by military units that are seeking candidates for service in special operations forces (SOFs). The aim of the study was to compare psycho-physical characteristics between Polish OCR athletes and SOF soldiers, in order to assess the possibility of recruiting future SOF soldiers from the OCR community.


Materials and Methods
The study included 23 OCR competitors, and 17 soldiers from JW Formoza were used as the comparative group. The psychological measure of resilience was assessed using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale. Participants also completed a survey in which they had to rank character strengths. Physical fitness was assessed on the basis of a 3000-m run and the maximum number of sit-ups and straight pull-ups.


Results
There were significant differences between OCR participants and JW Formoza soldiers: body mass index, 24.1 ± 1.5 vs. 25.9 ± 1.9 (P = .002); 3000-m run, 11:59 ± 0:49 vs. 12:11 ± 0:28 (P = .024); and straight pull-ups, 19 ± 3 vs. 15 ± 3 (P = .001). The most commonly chosen character strengths in both groups were self-control, team worker, and optimism.


Conclusions
OCR competitors show psychophysical characteristics similar to those expected from actual SOF personnel.
