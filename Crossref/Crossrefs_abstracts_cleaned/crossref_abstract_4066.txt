AbstractPurposeBond strength of resilient lining materials with denture base materials is continuously under development. The purpose of this systematic review is to perform a meta‐analysis to find out which form of resilient lining bonds better to the denture base, what surface treatments have the highest efficacy to increase the bonding, and what is the most commonly preferred test method to measure bond strength.Materials and MethodsBased on a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, 57 articles were included in this study. A meta‐analysis was performed on the results of the 57 articles.ResultsThe most commonly used test method was the tensile test. Effective surface treatments for bond strength vary depending on the type of the test applied and the type of the attached resilient lining material. Silicone‐based resilient lining materials are more commonly preferred than acrylic‐based resilient lining materials. While chemical agents and chemicals of resilient lining materials were the most commonly applied surface treatments, a very limited number of studies preferred applying CoJet and laser.ConclusionsThe efficacy of surface treatments varies depending on the resilient lining materials and the test type. More successful results can be achieved by selecting the appropriate surface treatment according to the type of the resilient lining material to increase the bond strength. In particular, when used alone, laser appears to be more effective. Chemical agents and laser are the most effective surface treatments for both silicone‐ and acrylic‐based liners. Moreover, new studies are required to determine the efficacy of CoJet. These findings should help clinicians select a suitable surface treatment to increase the bond strength of resilient lining materials to denture base materials.
