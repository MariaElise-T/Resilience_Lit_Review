IntroductionSuicidal ideation has repeatedly been reported as a predecessor of suicidal behavior. Several neuropsychological parameters have been associated with suicidal ideation. Emotional intelligence (EI) and resilience, which play an important role in the emergence of psychiatric disorders may also be related with suicidality.ObjectivesThe main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of trait EI and resilience with suicidal ideation. Moreover, we hypothesized that EI and resilience would be correlated with each other and that they were moderating variables between stressful life events and suicidal ideation.MethodsA total of 277 male and female students without current psychiatric diseases were recruited per online questionnaire asking for lifetime and 4-weeks suicidal ideation and demographic data and containing the Resilience Scale of Wagnild and Young, the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale and, for the measurement of trait EI, the Self-Report Emotional Ability Scale. Additionally, we applied the Social Readjustment Rating Scale to assess stressful life events.ResultsWe found significant negative correlations between lifetime and in part 4-weeks suicidal ideation and intrapersonal trait EI as well as resilience. Trait EI and resilience were interrelated. There was no significant moderating effect of trait EI or resilience on the relationship between SRRS score and suicidality.ConclusionAssessing EI and resilience as trait factors might be helpful in the prospective identification of suicidal individuals.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
