 The psychometric properties of the risk and resiliency checkup (RRC) were examined in a sample of 2,835 youth offenders. Solid evidence for internal consistency and convergent validity were demonstrated by correlations between the RRC subscales and the total scores. Three hypothetical factor models for the RRC were explored: a second-order factor model, a first-order 2-factor model without covariance, and a first-order 2-factor model with covariance. The first-order 2-factor model with covariance of the RRC was selected for further analyses. Recognizing that measurement invariance was rarely tested with risk assessments, this study examined the measurement invariance of the RRC model across three ethnic groups. The data supported configural invariance as well as partial metric invariance. This study presents substantial empirical evidence for the construct validity of the RRC across three ethnic groups. However, the first-order 2-factor model for the RRC indicates that risk and protective factors appear to be different dimensions.
