Abstract
Both the unpredictability of business environments and the limitless demands of stakeholders have fostered the emergence and spread of the concept of “organizational resilience” over the past two decades. This concept entails a quick recovery from unexpected shocks and an agile capacity to turn these shocks into opportunities. The concept has found a considerable space in many academic disciplines like child psychology, psychology and crisis management. However, it is still considered an emergent concept in organization- related studies. This study has focused on three branches of Cairo bank, which is the third biggest bank in Egypt, conducted interviews with 24 senior bankers of Cairo Bank, Egypt; and analyzed results of the interviews. The authors have created a model depicting the four main motives behind Cairo bank’s attempts to raise its senior bankers’ level of resilience. The four motives are: uncertainty, stakeholders’ pressure, bank culture adaptability and senior bankers’ voice.
