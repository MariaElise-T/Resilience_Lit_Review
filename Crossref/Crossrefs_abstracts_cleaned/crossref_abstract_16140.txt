Heeding calls to examine multiple protective factors within single studies, this study tested whether resilience uniquely predicted higher life satisfaction and lower depression over the predictive ability of generalized self-efficacy (GSE) and mindfulness among 332 university students. A second purpose was to test whether resilience uniquely buffered the relationship between two forms of stress—cumulative stress from particular negative life events and general perceived stress—and both life satisfaction and depression over the buffering ability of GSE and mindfulness. In hierarchical multiple regressions, resilience uniquely predicted 3% of the variance in satisfaction with life and 1% of the variance in depression. GSE and mindfulness buffered the relationship between cumulative negative life event stress and depression. At higher levels of GSE and mindfulness, the relationship between cumulative negative life event stress and depression was weaker.
