It is recently shown that discrete N × N linear unitary operators can be represented by interlacing N + 1 phase shift layers with a fixed intervening operator such as discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT). Here, we show that introducing perturbations to the intervening operations does not compromise the universality of this architecture. Furthermore, we show that this architecture is resilient to defects in the phase shifters as long as no more than one faulty phase shifter is present in each layer. These properties enable post-fabrication auto-calibration of such universal photonic circuits, effectively compensating for fabrication errors and defects in phase components.
