Padesky and Mooney's four‐step Strengths‐Based cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) model is designed to help clients build positive qualities. This article shows how it can be used to build and strengthen personal resilience. A structured search for client strengths is central to the approach, and methods designed to bring hidden strengths into client awareness are demonstrated through therapist–client dialogues. Development of positive qualities requires a shift in therapy perspective and different therapy methods from those employed when therapy is designed to ameliorate distress. Required adjustments to classic CBT are highlighted with specific recommendations for clinical modifications designed to support client development of resilience such as a focus on current strengths, the constructive use of imagery and client‐generated metaphors. Although the focus of this article is on resilience, this Strengths‐Based CBT model offers a template that also can be used to develop other positive human qualities. Copyright © 2012 Christine A.

A four‐step strengths‐based cognitive‐behavioral therapy approach is presented.
Therapists help clients identify existing strengths that are used to construct a personal model of resilience.
Client‐generated imagery and metaphors are particularly potent to help the client remember and creatively employ new positive qualities.
Behavioral experiments are designed in which the goal is to stay resilient rather than to achieve problem resolution.
Therapists are encouraged to use constructive therapy methods and interview practices including increased use of smiling and silence.
