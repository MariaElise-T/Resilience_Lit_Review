Many different metrics have been developed to measure the capacity for resilience to a disaster event. In order to track the dynamic response of a community in the aftermath of a disaster, however, it is necessary to consider measures that vary over time and for which data points are actually available on a relatively frequent basis. Unemployment, construction GDP, leisure and hospitality GDP, manufacturing GDP and information and communication technology GDP are all examples of measures which provide the opportunity to quantitatively assess the relative rate and extent of community recovery at regular time intervals following a disaster. By quantitatively analyzing the relative amount of resilience exhibited by a community we may gain better insight into its ability to recover, and thus develop a better understanding of the factors that allow it to return to normal levels of activity. The authors apply their analytical approach to compare the communities of New Orleans, Louisiana and Gulfport, Mississippi in the context of Hurricane Katrina.
