International airports are responding to the threat of climate change and various man-made hazards by proposing impact protection measures. Airport managers and risk controllers should develop a comprehensive risk assessment model to measure the mutual influence relationships of resilience factors. In this paper, the problem of treating resilience factors as independent ones in previous studies is overcome. In this study, we not only develop a framework for assessing resilience factors in international airports based on an aviation safety perspective, but also develop the Fermatean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FF-DEMATEL) to identify the mutual influence relationships of resilience factors. Fermatean fuzzy sets are incorporated in DEMATEL to reflect information incompleteness and uncertainty. The critical resilience factors of international airports were identified through real-case analysis. In terms of importance, the results show that rescue capability is a core capability that is important for airport resilience. In addition, “security management system (SeMS) integrity”, “education and training of ground staff on airport safety awareness”, “first aid mechanism for the injured”, and “adequate maintenance equipment for rapid restoration tasks” are identified as key factors that are given more weights. On the other hand, in terms of influence strength, the detection capability has the highest total influence and significantly influenced the other resilience capabilities. Finally, the influential network relation map (INRM) is utilized to assist decisionmakers in swiftly comprehending the impact of factors and formulating viable strategies to enhance airport resilience. This enables airport managers and risk controllers to make informed decisions and allocate resources efficiently.
