 A child suffering from cancer can be considerably stressful for parents, exerting a negative impact on their psychological well-being and quality of life. This study explored the relationships between resilience and quality of life in parents of children with cancer. We recruited 146 parents of children with cancer in two tertiary hospitals in mainland China. The results revealed that greater parental resilience was associated with better quality of life. It is essential to develop interventions that can enhance resilience for parents of children with cancer, thereby improving their quality of life. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03631485
