The impact of climate change on the aquaculture sector, which both supports livelihoods and is a source of nutrition in Kenya, is of concern. This study seeks to assess how stakeholders understand the impact of climate change on the aquaculture sector in Kenya, with a view to highlighting the steps needed towards enhancing the adaptation of aquaculture infrastructure to climate change. The study adopts a complementary mix of data collection methods (workshops, interviews, questionnaires, and field visits) implemented in four case study sites (Kakamega, Kajiado, Nairobi, and Kiambu). The findings of this study indicate that the most important climate hazard impacting aquaculture in Kenya is drought. It is estimated that about 40% of the potential growth of the subsector is lost due to the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. However, only a handful of farmers have opted for adaptation measures mainly because they are considered expensive. Facilitating the adequate adaptation of aquaculture practice to climate change will require a focus on improving the fish production infrastructure, improved aquaculture feeds, and policy changes. Overall, this study shows that for the sector in Kenya to overcome the impacts of climate hazards and be resilient to future climate change, there is also a need to prioritise economic incentives and capacity building. The findings are timely and should serve as crucial stimulus for critical stakeholders towards developing infrastructures in tackling the present climate change challenges confronting the aquaculture sector in Kenya.
