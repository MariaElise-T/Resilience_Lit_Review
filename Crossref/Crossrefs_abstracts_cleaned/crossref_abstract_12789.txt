AbstractExceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) in the resonant spectrum of non-Hermitian systems have been recently employed for sensing due to the sublinear response of the resonance splitting when a perturbant interacts with the sensor. The sublinear response provides high sensitivity to small perturbations and a large dynamic range. However, the resonant-based EPD sensing abides to the resolution limit imposed by the resonant quality factors and by the signal-to-noise ratio reduction due to gain-elements. Moreover, it is susceptible to local mechanical disturbances and imperfections. Here, we propose a passive non-resonant (NR) EPD-sensor that is resilient to losses, local cavity variations, and noise. The NR-EPD describes the coalescence of Bloch eigenmodes associated with the spectrum of transfer matrices of periodic structures. This coalescence enables scattering cross-section cusps with a sublinear response to small detunings away from an NR-EPD. We show that these cusps can be utilized for enhanced noise-resilient sensing.
