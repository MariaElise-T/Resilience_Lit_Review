AbstractThis article assesses the resilience of the North American food system in the context of the coronavirus pandemic in the immediate, medium, and long run. Focus is on the United States. The immediate consequence is substantial disruption of agricultural markets and falling prices, but systemic breakdown of the system is unlikely. Existing farm programs and emergency legislation will support U.S. farmers. Medium term, supply is likely to be strong, while pandemic‚Äêrelated disruptions in the developing world remain uncertain. Long term, the path forward under the fragility the pandemic has underscored is stronger international institutions and cooperation.
