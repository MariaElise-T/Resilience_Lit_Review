AbstractThis paper arose from the challenges inherent in defining and specifying the complicated, non‐functional system characteristic of resilience in the presence of competing definitions. The approach adopted is to specify the resilience of a system using a state‐machine. In this class of model, the state of the system is modelled by the states, the threat events that can be expected to result in altered operational states modelled by the definitions of the state transitions, and the result of the occurrence of a threat event modelled by the state to which the system would transition. The paper describes a generic model that can be tailored to form the basis for specifying a range of system types and illustrates its utility through two case studies.
