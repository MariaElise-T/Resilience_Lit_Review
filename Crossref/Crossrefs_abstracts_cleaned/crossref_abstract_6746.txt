Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper is to draw on the author’s background testing resilience in “no fail” organisations at the heart of UK government. The paper outlines a lean approach to high-impact training for strategic leaders, achieved in the form of low-cost exercises and harnessed to build resilience by surfacing risks, engaging with options and modelling decision outcomes. Repeated rehearsal of crisis and risk management responses grows organisational resilience and human capacity and reduces reputational, legal, operational and other costs. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – The methodology employed scenario-driven exercises (SDEs) is described for the first time in the open literature. 


Findings
 – Approaches such as SDEs build strategic resilience through effective training and learning, focusing on the fundamental priorities of strategic delivery, reputation and crisis management through avoiding and reacting to challenging circumstances. 


Practical implications
 – By being targeted at probing and gaming participants’ taking of decisions and logic of analysing available information, the use of frugal SDEs can provide substantial value in organisations where robust testing is welcomed and its findings implemented. 


Originality/value
 – SDEs are described for the first time in the open literature.
