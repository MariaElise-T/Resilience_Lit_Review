 There is a scarcity printed information in reference to the degree of difference in the resiliency and density of various plant fibres used as filling materials by upholsterers. The filling capacity of such materials is important because if two fibres are equally resilient and have similar characteristics in many other respects an upholsterer would be more interested in the one with a greater filling capacity if the price were the same per pound. In the present study major differences in the resiliency and filling capacity, as studied in a small experimental press, between different fibres were determined. Differences due to grades or in the method used in preparing an individual fibre to loosen it up or the method of shredding leaf fibres were not determined.
