The Nile Basin witnesses very high population growth rates, severe impacts of climate variability and change and severe food insecurity. About 94% of the Sudan is located in the arid and semiarid regions. Desertification, climate change and other forms of environmental degradation strongly contribute to poverty, displacement and conflicts. Separation of south Sudan imposed huge economic hardships to the country which was formerly reported to achieve economic stability due to the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Recent projections showed that the Sudan will witness severe water shortages of about 30 billion cubic meters by the year 2027. Different factors like the ENSO Event were found to contribute to the variability of the country’s rain fall and consequently, severe droughts, devastating floods and substantial socioeconomic impacts were incurred. Due to Climate Change the rain fall of the country showed 19% reduction and increased variability. Meanwhile, further reduction in rain fall coupled with south ward shift of agro-climatic zones and reduced crop productivity were anticipated.  Climate resilience is maintained by creating conducive policy environment, strengthening relevant institutions and early warning systems and implementation of the relevant programs and projects. In addition to that basin (regional) cooperation is of vital importance especially promotion of regional trade, coordinated reservoir operation and joint research. The Higher Council for Civil Defense is the apex body to coordinate disaster management in the Sudan. The paper recommends that the efforts to craft the national water policy, other sectoral policies, the national IWRM plan and the NAP are to be urged.
