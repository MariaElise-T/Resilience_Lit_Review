The ecological resilience of forests is the ability to return to a stable state after being subjected to external disturbances, and it is among the critical indicators of forest status. Climate change has significant effects on forest ecological resilience and diversity. In this research, we selected Mao County as the study region, and employed the forest landscape model LANDIS-II to simulate the effect of different climate scenarios on the ecological resilience of alpine forests in western Sichuan during the next 300 years from the forest composition and structure perspective. The findings revealed that: (1) climate change will favor an increase in forest ecological resilience values in short simulations, but future climate scenarios will negatively impact the ecological resilience of forests as the simulation progresses through the middle and long term. (2) The rate of change of forest ecological resilience in the MTDF and SCF ecotones, which have a higher proportion of Fir (Abies fabri) and Spruce (Picea asperata), was greater than that in the rest of the ecotones in the short-term simulation. In contrast, it was the opposite in the medium-term simulation. The rate of change of forest ecological resilience was more significant in the long-term simulation in all four ecotones. (3) The high values of forest ecological resilience in the short- and medium-term simulations were primarily concentrated within the MTDF and SCF ecotones among the midwestern and northern parts of the study region. When the simulation proceeded to a later stage, the ecological resilience of the forests decreased significantly throughout the study region, with high values occurring only in some areas within the western parts of the study region. The research results can grasp the influence of future climate on the ecological resilience of high mountain forests within western Sichuan and provide an essential reference for the sustainable development of local forests.
