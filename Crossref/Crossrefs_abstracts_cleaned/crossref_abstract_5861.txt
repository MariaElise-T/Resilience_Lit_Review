 Despite a growing literature on resilience in mainstream psychology, so far there has been very little discussion of resilience within educational psychology or how it might relate to practice. This article aims to bring resilience into the educational psychology literature and to show its potential to enhance service delivery. Resilience is defined and set within a wider ecological model. The key features are outlined and research findings reviewed. Resilience is related to existing interactive models of practice in educational psychology, and implications for practice are examined with regard to the core functions of the educational psychologist. It is shown that no paradigm shift is necessary for educational psychologists to begin to take a resilience perspective in all of their work. It is argued that there are distinct advantages for both educational psychologists and their clients in doing so.
