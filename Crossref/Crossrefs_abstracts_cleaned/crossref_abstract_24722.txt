Significance
Opioid use disorder is on the rise, as are efforts to understand vulnerability to misuse. However, understanding resilience to drug abuse is also critical to the development of novel treatments. Here we demonstrate that a brief postnatal exposure to a low-resource environment—using the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) manipulation—promoted resilience to addiction-related phenotypes in adult male rats. Specifically, LBN reduced impulsivity, morphine self-administration, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) glutamate transmission in males, effects not seen in females. By comparing the sexes, we found that changes in NAc gene transcription unique to LBN males may contribute to resilience. Importantly, these molecular changes reveal new targets that could guide the development of pharmacotherapies for opioid use disorder.
