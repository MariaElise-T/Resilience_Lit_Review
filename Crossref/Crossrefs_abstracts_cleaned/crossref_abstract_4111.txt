In our living environment, we frequently encounter natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, earthquakes, drought, petrochemical plant safety accident, stripping accident and so on. Due to global climate change, natural disasters have become even more devastating. Thus, it is important to look for ways to mitigate disasters. This study employs the concept of resilience to examine the ability of parks to recover from natural disasters. According to previous disaster history, the damage caused by natural disasters in the parks is mainly water and wind. Therefore, this study first conducted a literature review to find out relevant resilience criteria that are advantageous for combating water and wind disasters, and to recognize the degree of resilience achieved by each criterion. Then, based on the elements of the resilience criteria, the study establishes a preliminary resilience grading system. Furthermore, three different types of parks are evaluated under the grading system. This study provides a theoretical basis for resilience grading and suggestions for improving parks in the future.
