Introduction: Resilience is an ability of an individual to effectively adjust and thrive in adverse stressful conditions. Resilience has protective and compensatory effects against depression. Evaluating resilience clinically and modifying it among patients with depression hugely impacts their prognosis. We aimed to explore different clinical scales for measuring resilience as well as interventions used with an intent to improve resilience among patients with depression. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching PubMed central, Biomed central, and google scholar, using relevant MeSH keywords. The population of interest were the patients who were clinically diagnosed with Bipolar or Unipolar Depression and the population were not restricted to any country. Clinical scales for evaluation and interventions for resilience among patients with depression were set as an outcome of the study. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Quasi-experimental studies, observational studies, and narrative reviews were considered relevant research designs for extraction. Results: A total of 8689 articles were identified and 13 articles were included in the final review, which yielded five scales that have been identified and have been used to evaluate resilience among the patients who are clinically diagnosed with depression and six different interventions for building resilience among patients with depression. Conclusion: Resilience-building interventions will not only act as a preventive measure against depression but also help in promoting recovery and sustaining remission after a depressive episode. Clinical evaluation of resilience and management will significantly support boosting emotional experience.
