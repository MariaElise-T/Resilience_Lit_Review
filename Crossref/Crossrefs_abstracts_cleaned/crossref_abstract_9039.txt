Although institutional resilience is generally considered a desirable attribute in crisis management, many of our assumptions about its value are culturally based. The subject should be revisited because the most adaptive institutions tend to be those associated with statist coercive systems, especially in the developing world. The characteristics of resilient institutions and the factors promoting resilience are addressed here by reference to police systems in sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa. The conclusion drawn from the resultant discussion is that there is no simple hierarchy of values or goals in crisis management, that institutional manageability is only partly related to the skills and goals of the participants, and that the most significant factor facilitating resilience is an institution's fulfilment of a function or role considered useful by a government or regime.
