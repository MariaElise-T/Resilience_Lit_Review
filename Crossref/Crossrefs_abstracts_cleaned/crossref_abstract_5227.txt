 The effect of wetting/drying and freezing/thawing on the resilient modulus values of Meridian limestone aggregate stabilized with cement-kiln-dust is investigated. Freezing/thawing is found more detrimental than wetting/drying at low deviator stresses. In addition, the stabilized aggregate suffers greater strength reduction during the initial stages of the freeze/thaw test. On the other hand, wetting/drying produces greater strength reduction at high deviator stresses. The layer coefficients of the stabilized aggregate base, which are significantly higher than those of the raw aggregates, are reduced appreciably due to freezing/thawing and wetting/drying.
