Poor seed quality and climate change significantly affect the maize value chain in Burkina Faso. To address the challenges, a catalytic project titled “Strengthening resilient seed systems in the maize value chain in Burkina Faso—from research to markets” was initiated to enhance the development of a resilient maize value chain. This study aims to assess the role of the project in developing a sustainable and resilient maize value chain. In this study, we used a mixed approach in design and implementation: qualitative research using key informants’ interviews, secondary data such as baseline survey reports, and lessons learned during the seed value chain greening intervention implemented in the Hauts-Bassins and Cascades regions of Burkina Faso. We analyzed qualitative data following the Gioia method. Kabako, a drought-tolerant hybrid seed variety, doubled crop yields in demonstration plots compared to smallholder farms and regional and national averages. Extension officers and village-based advisors (VBAs) were trained on improved seeds, composting, strip cropping, intercropping, crop rotation, and water management technologies and afterward trained smallholders. The VBAs trained smallholders on proper postharvest management practices and processing. The off-takers acted as the market. However, smallholders also sold their maize products in the informal open markets. The aggregator system was the missing link in Burkina Faso’s maize value chain. There was limited involvement of women in the project. Results obtained from this study are valuable for policymakers and value chain actors in preparing policies and filling missing gaps for exploiting the potential of the maize value chain.
