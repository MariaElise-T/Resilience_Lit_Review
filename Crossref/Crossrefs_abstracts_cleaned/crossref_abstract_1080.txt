The urban planning requires a deterministic paradigm shift, in order to enhance the feasibility of urban resilience and to be capable of dealing with new emerging issues. In terms of the objective of the research, the present study is a fundamental research and of a theoretical nature. In terms of the nature and method of the research, it is a descriptive-analytical study based on documentary and library data collection. As the Critical Theory is a procedural approach for dealing with issues, that emphasizes on the process rather than the product, by integrating resilience, as a content element, it allows for the possibility to create a new paradigm that renews the existing evolutionary knowledge and creates a new revolutionary knowledge, which would ultimately fulfill the new demands. As a new combination of power-knowledge, which relies on decentralization and sharing power among the people, through bottom-top decision-making, the new paradigm creates mechanisms that put science at the service of the society, in order to build a bridge between science and decision-making.
