Background
Transitioning to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic multiplied the stressors and challenges typically encountered by new graduate nurses (NGNs), yet research exploring mental health variables of this subset of nurses remains sparse.


Method

              This study used an observational design and convenience sampling. NGN alumni (
              n
              = 192) from a pre-licensure nursing program were surveyed during the summer of 2021 regarding their experiences with resilience, anxiety, depression, and stress while transitioning to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            


Results
Participants reported moderate to severe levels of stress (76%), anxiety (27.6%), and depression (31.2%) while transitioning to practice. Most (79%) described themselves as resilient. The highest mean scores for stress, anxiety, and depression occurred during the fourth to eighth month of practice.


Conclusion

              Nursing professional development specialists, managers, and other stakeholders need effective strategies to monitor and promote NGNs' well-being and mental health to prevent burnout and turnover throughout the first year of practice.
