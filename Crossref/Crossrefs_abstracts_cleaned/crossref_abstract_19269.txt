Jakarta faces settlement problems where there are residents who live in riverbank areas. This problem makes residents vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season along the Ciliwung River and tidal floods in the North Jakarta area. Facing this, the DKI Jakarta government relocated residents who were flood victims to Marunda Rusunawa. Several problems related to the relocation policy need to be considered, such as the difference in the community's perspective on it, which causes residents to reject it. This study aims to analyze the community resilience model to understand the residents of Marunda Rusunawa post-flood relocation in DKI Jakarta. The research used stratified random sampling and analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique based on Partial Least Square (PLS). The analysis results show that the ecological aspect is the most dominant in shaping the resilience of the resident community, followed by cultural, social, economic, physical, and technological aspects. The political and human resource aspects are not aspects that form community resilience.
