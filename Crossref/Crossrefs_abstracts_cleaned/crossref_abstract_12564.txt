Curved bridges are commonly used for logistics and emergencies in urban areas such as highway interchange bridges. These types of bridges have complicated dynamic behaviors and also are vulnerable to earthquakes, so their functionality is a critical parameter for decision makers. For this purpose, this study aims to evaluate the bridge seismic resilience under the effects of changes in deck radius (50, 100, 150 m, and infinity), pier height irregularity (Regular and Irregular), and incident seismic wave angle (0째, 45째, and 90째) under short- and long-period records. In the first step, fragility curves are calculated based on the incremental dynamic analysis and probabilistic seismic demand models. Finally, seismic resilience curves/surfaces are constructed and their interpolated values of the log-normal distribution function presented for assessing system resilience. It is found that when long-period records are applied in one given direction, the angle of incidence has the most significant effect on seismic resilience, and bridges are most vulnerable when the angle of incidence tends to 0째. The effect of deck radius on seismic resilience became more remarkable as the angle of incidence increased. Additionally, results indicate that the bridge vulnerability in long-period records is more significant than that under short-period records.
