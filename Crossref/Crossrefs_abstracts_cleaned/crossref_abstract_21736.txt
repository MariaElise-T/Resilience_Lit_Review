 Cities are becoming smarter in their functions; however, they are not necessarily resilient and able to survive the impact of disasters. An integrated, smart and resilient city is a quest for today and future sustainability that has been scarcely studied. Therefore, this current paper develops a comprehensive framework for re-evaluating cities’ smartness and assessing their resilience against unforeseen disruptive events. A top-down approach is adopted with an expert’s validation process and evaluated in a hypothetical city’s water supply system to demonstrate its workability. The study contributes towards a holistic framework that includes smartness re-evaluation and resilience assessment components that can be used to ensure the resiliency of smart cities from both developed and developing countries resisting disasters.
