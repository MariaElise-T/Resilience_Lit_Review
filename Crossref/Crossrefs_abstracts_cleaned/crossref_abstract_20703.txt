"In contrast to earlier crises, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound influence on many facets of global life. This happened to Indonesia, particularly in the economic elements of the country. The MSME sector, which is one of the cornerstones of the Indonesian economy, was severely impacted, with many going out of business due to inability to survive. The purpose of this study is to assess if entrepreneurial competency or entrepreneurial resilience have a significant impact on the performance of MSMEs following the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses a quantitative verification and descriptive approach. Primary data obtained by collecting questionnaires from respondents. The data processed in this study were responses to questionnaires from MSME owners in Bandung City using a random sample approach, with up to 100 respondents. Statistical Package for Social Statistics (SPSS) was used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. Multiple linear regression analysis is used in this study to confirm the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable. According to the study's findings, the entrepreneurial competence variable has no meaningful influence. In the meanwhile, the entrepreneurial resilience variable has a major impact on MSMEs' success. This study has consequences both internally (for entrepreneurs) and externally (for government and higher education). "
