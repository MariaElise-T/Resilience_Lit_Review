Abstract
A resilient health system necessitates strong governance, political commitment, effective administrative entities and inter-organisational collaboration. This paper examines Indiaâ€™s current health policy landscape and explores the analytical and operational capacities required to establish a robust post-pandemic health system using the policy capacity framework described by Wu et al. (2015). We emphasised the need for a coordinated policy response to strengthen health information systems, health service management, human resource management and healthcare financing. The role that the planned implementation of Indian public health management cadres would play in the coming era, the importance of a comprehensive health information management system and the need for operational coordination between government and non-governmental organisations has also been emphasised.
