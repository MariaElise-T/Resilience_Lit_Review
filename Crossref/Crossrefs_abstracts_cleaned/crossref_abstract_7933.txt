The jamu (Indonesian traditional herbal drink) industry has grown in popularity because of people’s increased interest in the qualities of herbal remedies for bodily immunity. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only the market but also how businesses have managed their supply chains and production. COVID-19 has been claimed to be a test of a company’s long-term viability. Sustainability refers to a company’s ability to last a long time (corporate longevity). The tug of war between economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social justice that guarantees enterprises are profitable and sustainable is the main issue for companies in developing governance. From a theoretical standpoint, longevity is an intriguing problem. There are two types of corporate longevity: corporate longevity (CL) and corporate sustainable longevity (CSL). Little research has specifically examined the internal aspects of CSL. It necessitates several specific characteristics that all play a role in CSL. This research intends to highlight operational resilience as a crucial predictor of CSL’s significance in the jamu business. Companies that have consistently produced and benefitted from their business operations, before, during, and after the pandemic, have faced challenges of sustainability or longevity. Predecessor independent variables, and moderating or mediating variables, can be used to enable the operational resilience stance. To achieve CSL, the company must know how much it will determine its position in numerous ways in company practice. This study contributes to exploring dimensions and indicators of operational resilience to determine CSL in its relevance to the jamu industry. Different roles for operational resilience in different industry practices are also feasible.
