Abstract
Resilience is particularly important for companies and organizations, but particularly for the military organization, in terms of protecting and maintaining the health of the organization's leaders and members as well as their ability to respond in a competent way to the inquiries of a given situation given shock, risk and uncertainty.
This article focuses on understanding the factors that influence military structures resilience and how to design specific activities to increase their resilience in military actions. Addressing the concept of military structures resilience is particularly useful for the defence policy and military culture because the concept can identify key elements needed by the military and military units to overcome difficult situations specific to international missions and current military conflicts.
