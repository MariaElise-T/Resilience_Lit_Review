The dramatic changes in today’s global world have led to the emergence of a new concept — BANIworld (brittle, anxious, non-linear, incomprehensible). Resilience of economic systems and their most important sectors have become a major research focus. In Russia, industry is an important sector, which has suffered a considerable damage due to the sanctions pressure, disrupting established trade ties, imports of high-tech products, and Russian companies’ participation in global value chains. This study aims to identify opportunities for the development of domestic industry, primarily its regional complexes, in the new reality. These conditions are associated with the development of a resistance economy in Russia, which is a task pivotal to national security. Conceptually, this study is based on the classical theories of sustainable and long-term technical and economic development, research on economic resilience, industry and digital economy. The authors use methods of statistical, structural, and comparative analysis. The study focuses on the case of the Ural Federal District and its economy, showing the increasingly important role played by R&D and digitalization in this region. The digital transformation and technological advancement in general will contribute to this region’s economic development as well as to the country’s technological sovereignty.
