This paper illustrates how small and medium-sized farmers can resolve the complex issue of poultry manure disposal by implementing an innovative technology with the aims of reducing emissions and waste and transforming manure into precious resources for the production of energy and fertilizers. After a literature review, a case study is analyzed to identify the main elements of a circular business model that can realize a strategic priority, such as defining production and consumption processes compatible with sustainability, circularity, and resilience. This paper identifies the main elements that constitute the &ldquo;value proposition,&rdquo; &ldquo;value creation and delivery,&rdquo; and &ldquo;value captured,&rdquo; showing the potential benefits in terms of competitiveness and profitability. This good practice may be replicated by other breeding and agricultural companies that want to be sustainable and resilient. The analyzed topic is a key concern given the great quantity of energy and chemical substances used by farms and the challenges posed by current dramatic events, such as the Russia&ndash;Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, which have led to less availability of energy and fertilizers and unsustainable prices.
