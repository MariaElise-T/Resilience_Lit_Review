This paper presents the results of a qualitative study exploring clientsâ€™ perspectives of the impact and helpfulness of a brief coaching programme designed to increase individual resilience during a period of organisational change.Managers in a UK public sector organisation participated in a three-session resilience coaching programme which took place over a six- to nine-week period. Twelve managers took part in a quantitative study (Sherlock Storey et al., 2013) and six in the current qualitative study.Consistent themes, outlined in the paper, emerged from the interviews: tools and techniques; pressured working environment; time and space; moving forward; and coaches.The study provides some insight for organisations who are interested in the potential value of using a coaching approach to increase the individual resilience of key people during organisational change.
