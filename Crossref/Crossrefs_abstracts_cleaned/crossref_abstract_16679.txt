Abstract
Farmers in Padang City, West Sumatra Province, Indonesia face a dilemma of choices to change in land use due to urban development and population growth in the city. However, some farmers still survive and keep their land for agricultural farming purposes. This research aims to analyze farmers’ resilience factors for coping and adaptation towards land us change. This study used a survey method and selected; 3 sub-districts in Padang Cityhave the largest irrigated agriculture land area and have a tendency of high land conversion. One hundred and two rice farmers were selected as respondents with a criterion of having land close to the main road access, arterial roads, and residential roads and in an area with a high land convention tendency. Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which then analyzed using descriptive qualitative analysis. The results show that internal factors and external factorsinternal factors influenced farmers’ resilience and external factors influenced farmers’ resilience, internal factors and external factors influenced farmers’ re-silience, internal factors, and external factors influenced farmers’ resilience. Internal factors include land ownership, farm income, farming experience, and the nature of farming activity where farming is a transfer of strong knowledge and understanding between parents and their children in farming, thus strengthening farmers to continue their farming. The external factor that affects farmers to survive is the ownership system of communal land (ulayat land) as a Minangkabau cultural heritage. This forces farmers to keep working on their land. By considering these factors, the government policy should be concerned about the social system in Minangkabau society as a baseline policy to maintain agricultural land.
