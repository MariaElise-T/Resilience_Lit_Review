 This study proposed protégé’s ego-resiliency as a parsimonious predictor of perceived mentoring. Uncertainty-avoidance and collectivism orientations were hypothesized as boundary conditions of this relationship. An additive multiple moderation model was developed using conservation of resource theory. Data were collected from 193 employees of a large Southeast Asian commercial bank. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that protégé’s ego-resiliency was positively related to perceived mentoring. This positive relation was stronger for protégés who held weaker uncertainty-avoidance orientations and was stronger for those who held collectivistic orientations. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.
