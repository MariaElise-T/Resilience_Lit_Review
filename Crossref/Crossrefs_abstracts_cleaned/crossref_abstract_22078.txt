 This study explores international faculty members’ resilience and the active challenges to establishing coping mechanisms while facing a mental health crisis provoked by the Delta and Omicron lockdowns in China. Grounded in a qualitative approach, this study used a transcendental phenomenological methodology to examine 16 international faculty members affiliated with higher education institutions in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. The findings showed that participants had various mental health issues amid snap lockdowns and persistent nucleic acid application tests. They perceived the most influential sources of coping mechanisms to be (a) social and emotional support; (b) prosocial behavior; and (c) engagement with the public and social services alongside the domestic faculty members. This study emphasizes the significance of collective resilience and prosocial behaviors, calling on future scholars to pay more attention to the host group’s cultural values and community resilience as coping mechanisms during the public health crisis provoked by the pandemic.
