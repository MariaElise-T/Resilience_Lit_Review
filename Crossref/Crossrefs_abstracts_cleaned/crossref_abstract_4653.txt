Based on the concept of education for sustainable development (ESD), both individual mindfulness and resilience play a vital role in developing students’ competences in ESD. Across 20 samples, this meta-analysis investigated the association between mindfulness and resilience among the university student population. The results revealed that (1) the two constructs were significantly correlated, with a moderate effect (r = 0.465); (2) cultural background and national economic development level, as well as the type of resilience measurement scale, did not moderate the relationship between the two constructs; (3) the type of the mindfulness measurement scale was a statistically significant moderator of the relationship between mindfulness and resilience among university students; (4) the mindfulness dimension of observing presented the lowest correlation with the university students’ resilience, while acting with awareness and non-reacting were shown as the two most relevant dimensions for the target group. The findings of the meta-analysis study convey important implications for ESD within the university context.
