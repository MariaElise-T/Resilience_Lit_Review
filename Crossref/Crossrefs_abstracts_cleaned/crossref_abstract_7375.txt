Urban resilience is the capacity of cities to confront any potential and actual challenges through anticipation, adaptation and recovery. There are many definitions of urban resilience, each focusing on a different aspect – government, administration, society, economy, capacity to withstand outside and/or inside threats, ability to grow and so on. When analyzed and taken as a whole, our view is that these theories create the image of the city as a living organism, made up of a number of elements that must work together in order to maintain it resilient to shocks and capable of absorbing shocks. The fundamental unit of this organism is the individual – and the individual’s resilience gives the tone for the resilience of the whole. From this perspective, we can say that urban resilience works like an immune system – its role is mainly to prevent but, when needed, also to withstand actively against any threats and/or shocks.
