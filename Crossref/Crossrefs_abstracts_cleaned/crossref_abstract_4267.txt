We contend that work ambivalence is a key building block in fostering physician burnout and its sequalae, while engagement in meaningful work and receiving family support for that work enhances resilience. No singular approach to curbing burnout in OBGYN physicians has received empirical support. Clinical experience suggests that curbing physician burnout requires a combination of workplace redesigns, positive leadership behaviors, and resilience training that teaches practical applications from the fields of resilience, emotional intelligence, positive psychology, and relationship systems. This paper highlights organizational and leadership interventions that foster physician engagement, and describes how physicians can foster personal and family resilience.
