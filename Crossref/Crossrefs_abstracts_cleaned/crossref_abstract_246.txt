Abstract
The public health community remains vigilant in sustaining the resiliency it acquired and strengthened. The time comes for us to direct our attention to policy related concerns so as to heighten the momentum in promoting the interest on public health and protection. Pandemic, war, poverty... the battle continues, so as our response, to take heed and believe that we can surpass the challenges and trials of times amid the uncertainties.
