Abstract
In early August 2016, Inuit artists Stephen Agluvak Puskas and Isabella-Rose Weetaluktuk co-curated an original format film festival in Montreal, produced in partnership with Concordia University, the FOFA Gallery and Terres en vues festival. For three evenings in a row, the FOFA Gallery’s outdoor courtyard, which opens onto one of the city’s busiest downtown streets, offered up Inuit ‘country’ food (traditional cuisine like raw seal meat and arctic char), music, Inuit games, and film and video. Each evening featured a series of short and feature films directed by or produced in serious collaboration with Inuit, arranged under three distinct themes; Unikausiit (history), Nuna (land) and Pimmariktuq (resilience). This interview is a conversation between Inuk art historian Heather Igloliorte and Puskas and Weetaluktuk, in which the co-curators reflect on the experience of creating the film festival.
