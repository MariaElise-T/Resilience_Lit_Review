The São João Batista riverside community experienced a golden phase in the production of cachaça from sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.). It underwent a period of decay around 1975 and, in 2004, became an Agro-extractive Settlement Project (PAE), with an economic system based on the exploitation and commercialization of açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.). This study analyzes the resilience of PAE São João Batista, Abaetetuba, Pará, from the establishment of sugar cane mills to the transition of their economic system to the exploitation and commercialization of açaí. It was based on field research conducted with 141 riverside dwellers employing semi-structured interviews. The adaptive cycle was built up, from which resilience was analyzed. The growth of the açaí fruit market identifies the community's point of resilience. The sugar cane-açaí economic system transition enabled riparian populations to experience changes and to create conditions for reorganizing themselves as a settlement.
