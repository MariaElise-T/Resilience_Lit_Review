IntroductionApproximately 0.5 million fatalities per year are attributed to substance use disorder (SUD). SUD is refractory to therapy and has a high relapse rate. Cognitive deficits are also common in patients with SUD. Cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment that may build resilience and reduce relapse among people with SUD. Our planned systematic review aims to clarify the effect of CBT on resilience and the relapse rate in adult patients with SUD compared with treatment as usual or no intervention.Methods and analysisWe will search the Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, EBSCO CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases from inception to July 2023 for all relevant randomised controlled or quasiexperimental trials published in English. The follow-up period of included studies must be at least 8 weeks. The PICO (Population, intervention, control, and outcome) format was used to develop the search strategy. Search terms will be combined using boolean operators and have been customised for different databases. The Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials will be used to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Extracted data will include bibliographic data, sample size, intervention method, summary of the findings, follow-up duration and effect sizes with standard errors. A random effects model will be used to combine effect measures. Subgroup analyses will be performed by CBT type, sex and SUD subtype, as applicable. I2statistics will be used to evaluate heterogeneity, and funnel plots will be used to address publication bias. If we detect significant heterogeneity, the findings will be reported as a systematic review without a meta-analysis.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval is not required for this study. The findings will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022344596.
