Achieving successful performance is an important goal for companies. However, in turbulent market environments, this goal can be quite difficult to achieve. Therefore, today organizations should have the necessary skills, such as learning capability and resilience, to have successful performance indicators, especially in turbulent market conditions. This study suggests that the antecedent effect of organizational learning capability and the moderating effect of organizational resilience should be considered in order to strengthen organizational performance in turbulent markets. Moreover, this study aims to develop a moderated mediation model that measures both the indirect effect of organizational learning capability on organizational performance, and the direct effect of organizational learning capability on organizational performance, with the mediating effect of organizational resilience under the moderation of market turbulence.  In this study, a questionnaire study was applied to the high level managers of 109 manufacturing organizations. According to the findings of the research, it is seen that organizational learning capability has a direct positive effect on organizational performance and organizational learning capability has an indirect effect on organizational performance through mediating effect of organizational resilience. In addition, it has been found that market turbulence moderates the direct effect of organizational learning capability on organizational performance. Also, it has been found that the indirect effect of organizational learning capability on organizational performance through organizational resilience is moderated by market turbulence. Considering the data obtained as a result of this study, it is seen that organizational learning capability plays an important role in order to have strong organizational performance in turbulent markets, with the help of the mediating effect of organizational resilience.
