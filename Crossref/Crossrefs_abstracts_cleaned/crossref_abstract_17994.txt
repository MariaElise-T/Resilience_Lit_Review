Abstract
Agri-food supply chains have a multitude of roles for the mankind. Among others, they encompass the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy; they are responsible for feeding the planet; they are associated with various environmental and social impacts. Therefore, their operation, efficiency and performance are crucial in many contexts. In this paper we investigate the transitions of agri-food supply chains towards two different goals: circular economy and resilience. Circular economy has been a focal priority in the EU and global agenda, which aims at redefining the patterns that have been associated with linear economy models in order to meet environmental, social, and economic challenges of our era. On the other hand, supply chain resilience is the capacity of supply chains to be prepared for unexpected risk events, act and recover promptly to probable disruptions, and return to their original position or move to a better ideal condition. In particular, we focus on the enablers and barriers for both goals and identify possible convergences and deviations. The former are expected to lead to win-win opportunities, whereas the latter will lead to trade-offs.
