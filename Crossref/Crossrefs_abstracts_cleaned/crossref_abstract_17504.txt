Simulating the dynamic process of urban resilience and analyzing the mechanism of resilience-influencing factors are of great significance to improve the intelligent decision-making ability of resilient urban planning. The purpose of this article is to implement a comprehensive literature review on the quantitative computation and simulation studies of urban resilience, investigating the characteristics of current research, including the most commonly applied methods, the most frequently spaceâ€“time scales, the most popular research topics, and the most commonly involved risk types. Then, the study provides recommendations for future research: (1) research on multiple risk disturbance scenarios, (2) the computation of urban resilience from the public perspective, and (3) a computation-simulation framework with the goal of revealing the mechanism. Finally, this study constructs a resilience-computation simulation framework for resilient urban planning, which lays a foundation for the further development of urban-resilience dynamic-simulation computing and planning-scenario applications in the future.
