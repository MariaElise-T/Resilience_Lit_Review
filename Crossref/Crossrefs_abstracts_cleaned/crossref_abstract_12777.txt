An important brick manufacturer in partnership with the BBRI has suc-ceeded to propose efficient acoustic solutions for this kind of lightweight materials by treating the flanking transmission using flexible interlayers at junctions and foundations. A large measurement campaign has been carried out to study the efficiency of the resilient joint and to provide a prediction model on airborne sound insulation in brickwork constructions. The prediction model used is based on the standard 12354-1 but was adapted in order to take into account higher orders for the flanking transmission paths. This adapted model thus allowed to study different applications of the flexible joint and their contribution to the improvement of the global sound insulation. This paper presents a discussion on the calculation model, the input data and some early results.
