Background Resilience aids healthcare professionals in navigating through and bouncing back from stressful situations in the workplace. Resilience can increase job satisfaction, work motivation, and professional commitment while decreasing burnout, and ultimately job turnover. More resilient employees experience lower instances of burnout and greater life satisfaction. Objective The primary study objective is to determine the relationship that pharmacist resilience has on burnout and job performance. Methods Licensed pharmacists in Florida were sent a Qualtrics survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) via email, which included demographics data, and valid and reliable assessment tools for resilience, burnout, and job performance. Linear regressions were used to test if resilience significantly predicted each of the output variables: burnout and job performance. Results Survey responses were received from 942 pharmacists. The regressions showed that resilience significantly predicted both burnout (β1 = −.701, P < .001) and job performance (β1 = .35, P < .001). As resilience increased, the levels of burnout decreased, and job performance increased. Resilience explained 29% of the variance in burnout, and 11% of the variance in job performance. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that resilience significantly predicts both pharmacist work-related burnout and job performance. The more resilient the pharmacist, the lower the chances of work-related burnout and the higher the likelihood of better job performance. Organizations should pursue opportunities to educate healthcare workers on methods to increase resilience and to bring attention to the importance of this topic.
