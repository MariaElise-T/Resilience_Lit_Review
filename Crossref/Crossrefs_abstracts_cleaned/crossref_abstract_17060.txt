Aims and objectivesTo examine discrimination and resilience experiences of people who identify as transgender and establish potential health service responses.BackgroundPeople who identify as transgender face many challenges in society in terms of the knowledge, understanding and acceptance of a person's gender identity.DesignA narrative review of quantitative empirical research.MethodsA comprehensive search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts electronic databases from 2006–2016 was conducted.ResultsThe search yielded 1,478 papers and following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 19 papers were included in the review. The findings reveal that there is a need to ensure that the needs of transgender people are represented, fully integrated and clearly linked to outcomes that improve their health and quality of life.ConclusionsDiscrimination experiences can result in poorer health outcomes; however, many people have developed resilience and positive coping strategies.Relevance to clinical practiceNurses need to recognise and respond appropriately to the care and treatment needs of this population. Comprehensive nursing assessments and plans of care that encompass all aspects of the person should be in place supported by clear policy guidelines and evidence‐based research. The education requirements of practitioners are outlined.
