The article is devoted to the study of the impact of the resilience of Greek migrants on their expectations for future employment in connection with resettlement to permanent residence on the territory of the Russian Federation. The survey was applied on two original questionnaires and psychological testing (a questionnaire of resilience; methods of assessment of job satisfaction; scale of satisfaction with life). Some differences in the expectations of migrants are established. Thus, persons with a high degree of vitality are focused on the fact that the future work would be pleasing, stable, and there would be career prospects. Migrants with a low degree of resilience rely on a special social status of work and a good relationship with the leader. The general pattern is that resilience gives workers labour mobility, potentiates their confidence in the correctness of the decision on migration. Ultimately, migrants linked their lives to the host country through work.
