Cultural and creative industries (CCIs) clusters are essential in increasing regional economic resilience, and regions with solid economic resilience can also promote the formation of CCIs clusters. However, there is little research on the two-way effect of cultural and creative industries on regional economic resilience. This study explores the relationship between the clusters of CCIs clusters and regional economic resilience from a spatial perspective. This paper takes 31 provinces and cities in China as the research object, uses panel data from 1997 to 2020, and divides the CCIs clusters into specialization and diversification. The spatial simultaneous equations model was used to verify the two-way influence relationship and the spatial interaction between the specialization and diversification of CCIs clusters and the regional economic resilience, respectively. The study found a two-way positive relationship between specialized CCIs clusters and regional economic resilience, while the opposite relationship existed between diversified CCIs clusters and regional economic resilience. There were positive spatial spillovers between CCIs clusters and regional economic resilience. The enhancement of local economic resilience comes from the specialization of local CCIs clusters and the diversification of CCIs clusters in neighboring regions.
