Abstract
In recent years, China has made great efforts to promote the planning and construction of sponge cities. The State Council also pointed out that the low-impact development mode should be actively carried out to promote the construction of sponge cities in the approval of the overall planning of the pilot cities of sponge city construction. With the intensification of climate and environmental problems such as global warming, sponge city is gradually adopted for urban planning and construction in the development of modern cities, so as to improve the utilization rate of urban water resources. But still exist in the process of urban planning integration, the problem of the relative lack of systematic and consistent, so we need resilience thinking, introduced on the basis of the sponge city, in the city the top-level design from multidimensional perspectives of using toughness thinking mode for planning and construction, to further improve city heat island effect, and the ability of severe weather. Based on the current advanced concept of resilient city, this paper puts forward the conception of sponge city planning in view of the problems in the planning and construction of sponge cities in China, in order to provide a reference model for the pilot city construction.
