The purpose of this study was to examine practice environment, resilience, and burnout and to identify the impacts of practice environment and resilience on burnout among clinical nurses working at a tertiary hospital. A cross-sectional secondary data analysis was conducted using a convenience sample of 199 nurses. The nurses completed survey questionnaires regarding practice environment, resilience, and burnout. The majority of the nurses were below the age of 30, single, and worked in medical-surgical wards. Approximately, 92% of the nurses reported moderate to high burnout, with a mean practice environment score of 2.54 ± 0.34 and resilience score of 22.01 ± 5.69. Practice environment and resilience were higher in the low level of burnout than in the moderate to high level of burnout. After controlling for demographic and occupational characteristics, resilience and nursing foundations for quality of care were significant predictors of burnout (OR = 0.71, p = 0.001; OR = 0.01, p = 0.036, respectively), explaining 65.7% of the variance. In a mixed practice environment, increased resilience and nursing foundations for quality of care lowered nurses’ burnout. Our findings suggest that interventions focused on enhancing individual resilience and practice environment and building better nursing foundations for quality of care should be developed and provided to alleviate burnout in clinical nurses working at tertiary hospitals. Nursing and hospital administrators should consider the importance of practice environment and resilience in nurses in developing interventions to decrease burnout.
