Koolulam is a social musical initiative launched in 2017. The aim of Koolulam is to strengthen the fabric of society through mass singing - collaborative singing in large groups. This is the first study worldwide that examines this social musical phenomenon. The aim of the study to examine the profile of people who participate in Koolulam events and their motives for partaking in such an event, and to examine whether the social, communal and emotional characteristics of mass singing such as in a Koolulam event, include elements that may help strengthen the resilience of individuals in a group. Â This study used a mixed method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques. The data were collected through questionnaires answered by 914 participants. The findings indicate that Koolulam events are perceived as a unique phenomenon, different from other multi-participant events. The shared singing experience at these events has social, communal and emotional characteristics.
Conclusions: The study shows that singing even one song in a large group consisting of a combination of different voice types, fosters harmony and tolerance among the different voices in the group.
