The purpose of the article is to examine the response of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam to supply chain finance and then have a strategy to use supply chain risk resilience to control supply chain risk and improve supply chain effectiveness and SMEs performance. The analysis results are based on three months of data collected from 890 SMEs in Vietnam. The results show that supply chain finance has a statistically significant positive impact on supply chain effectiveness, SMEs performance and supply chain risk resilience. At the same time, supply chain finance has a negative impact on the supply chain risk of Vietnam SMEs in the global supply chain. Finally, we offer recommendations to help SMEs improve supply chain effectiveness and performance through the supply chain finance tool.
