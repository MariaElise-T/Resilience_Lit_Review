• The soil microbiome refers to the diverse collection of microorganisms present in soil, many of which can mediate essential soil functions such as nutrient cycling and plant pest and disease suppression.
• There is growing international interest in the potential to manipulate the soil microbiome to deliver improved agricultural and environmental outcomes.
• Molecular techniques are rapidly increasing understanding of the soil microbiome structure and function but manipulating soil microbiomes for pasture resilience still presents significant science challenges.
