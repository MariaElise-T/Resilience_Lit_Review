The frequency of inundation in urban watersheds has increased, and structural measures have been conducted to prevent flood damage. The current non-structural measures for complementing structural measures are mostly independent non-structural measures. Unlike the current non-structural measures, the new operating technique based on flood forecasting is a real-time mixed measure, which means the combination of different non-structural measures. Artificial rainfall events based on the Huff distribution were used to generate preliminary and dangerous thresholds of flood forecasting. The new operation for centralized and decentralized reservoirs was conducted by two thresholds. The new operation showed good performance in terms of flooding and resilience based on historical rainfall events in 2010 and 2011. The flooding volume in the new operation decreased from 6617 to 3368 m3 compared to the current operation in 2010, and the flooding volume in 2011 decreased from 664 to 490 m3. In the 2010 event, the results of resilience were 0.831835 and 0.866566 in current and new operations, respectively. The result of resilience increased from 0.988823 to 0.993029 in the 2011 event. This suggestion can be applied to operating facilities in urban drainage systems and might provide a standard for the design process of urban drainage facilities.
