Abstract
The reasonable scale of urban river ecological space and the connectivity of bank and slope water and soil exchange are the basic conditions to keep the flow of matter, energy and species in water unimpeded, as well as the way out for the dilemma of urban river ecological governance. The concept of resilience in spatial planning is used to break the artificial partition between river land space and water space, explore the compound function of urban space, and realize the way of integration and synergism of land and water space.The research shows that scientific overall planning and rational utilization of urban space is the basis of realizing land function combination and solving urban river governance predicament. Urban spatial planning and layout should highlight the backbone role of river-dominated urban eco-environment texture, restore the function of river network ecological corridor, build the integration of public open space and river space, optimize the use of land resources for achieving functional compounding; Meanwhile, expand the three-dimensional space of the river, increase the spatial diversity, improve the openness of the waterfront space for achieving functional balance through collaboration. To break the artificial boundaries of waters and land areas and form the integration of land and water area, the water environment management of river spatial design needs to focus on key elements such as the urban river network plane shape, the spatial layout of river sections, the ecological treatment and reconstruction of bank protection, and the temporal and spatial evolution of rivers. Application of multi-natural river ecological restoration, near-natural river construction, semi-natural ecological flood control and other technologies can achieve the ecological treatment effect of bank protection and improve the ecological permeability of bank slope. By opening up the river space, it provides a limited dynamic change space for the river bed and a space that evolves with time, which is conducive to exerting the function of ecological corridor of urban river system and driving the improvement and promotion of ecological environment in urban areas.
