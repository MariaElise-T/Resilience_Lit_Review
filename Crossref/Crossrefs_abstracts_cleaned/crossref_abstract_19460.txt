            The current study aimed to explore the relationships between nurses' mindfulness and job satisfaction and the mediating roles of positive affect and resilience. A total of 1,043 Chinese hospital nurses completed self-report questionnaires from March to April 2019. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to identify the relationships among the four variables, and the bias-corrected bootstrap method was used to test the mediation hypotheses. The results revealed that nurses' mindfulness was at a medium-high level, whereas positive affect, resilience, and job satisfaction were at medium levels. The total scores and dimension scores of the four variables showed strong positive correlations, and nurses' mindfulness affected job satisfaction directly and indirectly through the intermediary roles of positive affect and resilience. Nursing managers should recognize the importance of mindfulness and incorporate mindfulness training into health promotion and employee management plans for hospital nurses. In addition, strategies should be implemented to cultivate positive affect and resilience. [
