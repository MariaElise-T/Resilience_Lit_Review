 Furniture is commonly perceived according to its functional role as a work surface, storage vessel, and architectural device designed to support the physical needs of the body in navigating everyday tasks. In the case of disasters such as seismic events, however, furniture invites alternative roles. For instance, we are instructed to “duck, cover, and hold” beneath a table in order to avoid injury from falling debris, and thus, in this context, a table undergoes an instantaneous transformation into a shelter. In the case of distressing events such as earthquakes, while our physical needs are considered, our psychological needs are seemingly ignored. This article presents a case study of speculative furniture designs that expand upon and challenge the traditional role of furniture by prioritizing the mitigation of anxiety over physical functionality. In an aim to promote psychological resilience around the anticipatory and residual stress that we encounter in our everyday lives, these designs apply empathy, humor, and play to elicit positive emotional responses. By capitalizing on the unique sensory–rich interactions afforded by furniture, this research proposes an unconventional yet valuable strategy in fostering meaningful, object–centered relationships.
