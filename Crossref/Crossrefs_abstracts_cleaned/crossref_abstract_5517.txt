The supply chain is the basis for the functioning of today's society because it ensures the timely supply of all the resources needed to produce products or provide services offered in the market. Due to changes in the environments in which the supply chain exists, new risks arise that could jeopardize its functioning. Interruption in the normal functioning of the chain may result in the risk of inability to meet the requirements of stakeholders. Given this, the aim of this paper is to define a conceptual model of supply chain resilience management. The paper is based on the conducted secondary research and analysis of the achievements of other researchers in this field. The model described in this paper is based on the principles of the quality management system and provides a systematic approach to the analysis of supply chain threats, defining measures to reduce the threat, and testing and improving the established system.
