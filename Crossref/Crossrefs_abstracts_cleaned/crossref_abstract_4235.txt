 Obtaining the dynamic properties of resilient materials is a subject that has been extensively researched by other workers using a variety of techniques; many of these techniques use detailed numerical methods. In this paper a simplified approach has been adopted which allows the dynamic stiffness of resilient layers to be predicted at higher frequencies where wave effects across the thickness of the layer are important. The method is a development of the technique used in the ISO Standard 9052-1. However, the ISO Standard method will only give the stiffness at one frequency whereas the method in this paper gives the stiffness across a frequency range. Reasonable agreement with measurements is shown.
