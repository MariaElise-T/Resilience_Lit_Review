Background Breast cancer is currently the most prevalent malignancy among women. Psychological resilience is an important factor that diminishes the stress-related emotional and psychosocial disturbances triggered when receiving the diagnosis. Furthermore, resilience appears to be associated with cortisol, the hormonal end-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, further studies are needed due to the mixed results reported. Thus, we aim to examine the predictive role of social support and cortisol in resilience among breast cancer patients. Methods A total of 132 women with primary breast cancer completed the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) and the Resilience Scale (RS-14) and provided four salivary samples for the estimation of participantsâ€™ total daily cortisol production, for which the formula of the area under the curve with respect to the ground (AUCg) was applied. Moderation analyses were performed to study the influence of social support and AUCg on psychological resilience levels. Results The regression analyses showed a direct significant effect for the emotional support subscale of MOS-SSS on resilience and the interaction between emotional support and AUCg was also found to be statistically significant. Specifically, the conditional effect of emotional support on resilience was found to be significant at middle ( M = 3.08; p < .05) and low levels ( M = .59; p < .001) of AUCg. Conclusions Our results suggest that newly diagnosed breast cancer women with middle and low diurnal cortisol profiles may benefit more from emotional support based-interventions while women with high diurnal cortisol may need more individualized therapies.
