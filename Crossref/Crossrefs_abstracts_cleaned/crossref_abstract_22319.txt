AbstractFrom an ecological perspective, this study aimed to examine the relationship between a sense of community and life satisfaction as moderated by personal resilience and partner resilience among Chinese older adults. Using a cross‐sectional design, a total of 258 Chinese couples (age range 60–97 years) completed measures related to sense of community, resilience, and life satisfaction. The results showed that (a) sense of community was positively associated with life satisfaction after controlling for personal resilience, partner resilience, and other covariates, and (b) a three‐way interaction between sense of community, personal resilience, and partner resilience emerged to predict life satisfaction. Specifically, the effect of sense of community on life satisfaction under the condition of low personal resilience–low partner resilience was weaker than it was under other conditions. Tailored interventions to enhance community resources, individual resilience, and couples’ strengths are recommended to promote the life satisfaction of Chinese older adults.
