This study describes deaf and hearing female adolescents’ resilience with their respective counterparts using the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale. The study was conducted on 160 adolescent [80 deaf (40 females) and 80 hearing (40 females)] students who were randomly selected. Quantitative and qualitative data collections were made through the questionnaire and interviews. The study mainly used descriptive and inferential statistics for data analysis. The results revealed that hearing adolescent students’ average resilience score was significantly greater than deaf students. Female adolescent students’ score level was also found to be significantly lesser than their counterparts. The results further revealed that there was a significant difference in scores among deaf female, deaf male, hearing female and hearing male adolescent students in which deaf female adolescent students’ resilience scores were the lowest. The findings call for health and psychological professionals and families to provide adequate support for deaf and female adolescents to develop resilience.
