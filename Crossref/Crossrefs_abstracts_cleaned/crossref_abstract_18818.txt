Abstract
This article situates contemporary developments in policing in the context of an emerging cross-disciplinary focus on ‘resilience’. We argue that an inchoate reimagining of how police, as security professionals, are engaging, and might engage, in the governance of safety with communities in response to emerging ‘harmscapes’ might be, and should be, conceptualized as ‘resilience policing’. We situate our analysis within the context of developments in community policing.
