Contrary to the common belief that traumatic experiences always lead to psychopathology, most individuals with such experiences can actually recover from their traumas. Factors leading to a person's resilience are countless, but one of the important factors explaining why some individuals do not develop any kind of pathology in the face of trauma is emotion regulation. The degree that a person experiences difficulty in emotion regulation is a predictive factor for his/her resilience in the face of adverse childhood events, such as abuse and neglect. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among childhood traumas, difficulties in emotion regulation, and resilience among university students. The analysis was conducted with 404 participants. The demographic form, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Brief Form, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used for data collection. The results confirmed that difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the relationship between childhood traumas and resilience. Childhood trauma affected the resilience of participants depending on the level of the difficulties they experienced in emotion regulation.
