Phragmites australis subsp. australis (hereon Phargmites), has become a dominating threat to the Great Lakes wetlands at a time when climate change pressures are also compromising the integrity of the native habitat. Understanding the role this invader plays in climate change resiliency is crucial in order to improve management decisions to protect and restore wetlands. This literature review was conducted to predict if the Great Lakes wetland’s resiliency to climate change effects could improve in absence of Phragmites. Peer-reviewed articles were analyzed to determine the overall impact of Phragmites on the Great Lakes wetlands by drawing connections between study findings and how this invader may influence the wetland’s ability to mitigate climate change. Evaluation of Phragmites invasion impacts included effects on floral and faunal species diversity, richness and composition, methane and carbon emissions, nutrient availability, and water levels and quality. This examination of studies showed floral, avian, and turtle species diversity to be negatively related to Phragmites invasion, with no clear impacts on frogs and macroinvertebrates. Studies also showed that Phragmites-dominated wetlands increased carbon sequestration, but also increased methane emissions which has greater radiative forcing power, resulting in a net source of greenhouse gases. Soil nutrient availability was found to be negatively impacted by this invader, and effects on water levels and quality were inconclusive due to insufficient available evidence. Overall, this information provides indication that the Great Lakes wetlands could benefit from Phragmites removal, likely enhancing the wetland’s ability to resist climate change effects.
