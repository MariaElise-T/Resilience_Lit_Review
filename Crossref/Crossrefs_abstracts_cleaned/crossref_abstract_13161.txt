AbstractAimTo investigate the levels of subjective well‐being in graduate nursing students, explore the impact of academic stress and resilience on subjective well‐being, and examine the mediation effect of resilience on the relationship between academic stress and subjective well‐being among graduate nursing students.BackgroundFew studies explore the impact of academic stress and resilience on subjective well‐being among graduate nursing students. Understanding the status of subjective well‐being and associated factors in graduate nursing students will enable the development of tailored interventions to improve their well‐being and academic achievements during graduation education.DesignA cross‐sectional design.MethodsGraduate nursing students were recruited by social media between April 2021 and October 2021, in China. Subjective well‐being was measured using the General Well‐Being Schedule, resilience by the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale, and academic stress through the Questionnaire of Assessing Academic Stress for graduate nursing students. Structural equation modelling was used to test the relationship among academic stress, resilience and subjective well‐being.FindingsThe mean score of subjective well‐being for graduate nursing students was 76.37. The proposed model revealed a satisfied fit with the data. Academic stress and resilience were significantly related to subjective well‐being in graduate nursing students. Resilience partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and subjective well‐being, and the mediation effect accounted for 20.9% of the total effect of academic stress on the subjective well‐being.ConclusionAcademic stress and resilience affected subjective well‐being in graduate nursing students, while resilience partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and the subjective well‐being.No Patient or Public ContributionThis study did not involve patients, service users, caregivers or members of the public.
