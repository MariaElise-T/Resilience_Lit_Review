The occurrence of natural and man-made hazards usually leads to the emergence
of consequences that affect the living environment. Risk assessment as a process
helps to comprehend risk. A risk assessment based on complex semi-qualitative
approach to probability of hazard with specified consequences occurrence makes
it possible to designate risk levels. In the Transcarpathian region the assessed risk levels distribution has been visualized on risk maps. Such risk maps as a form of risk
communication may be used to support resilience strengthening regarding identified
hazards and its impact on the society, infrastructure and environment. Based
on conducted research, a risk assessment methodology and risk mapping methodology
were proposed. Moreover, the usage of proposed methods was referenced
to the resilience strengthening and its influence on the sustainable development
of the Transcarpathian region. The proposed tool is a solution that is correlated
to 30 innovations linking dedicated Disaster Risk Reduction with Sustainable
Development Goals.
