Resilience had statistically significant positive correlation with years of experience (r=0.160, p=0.002); negatively significant with stress (r = -0.281, p< 0.001) and negatively significant with anxiety (r = -0.210, p < 0.001). Depression was negatively significant with years of experience (r = - 0.132, p = 0.013) while stress was positively significant with depression (r = 0.764, p< 0.001) and anxiety (r = 0.751, p < 0.001).Conclusion: There is a need to organize programmes that will improve the resilience of professional nurses should be organized to reduce the effects of stress, anxiety and depression among nurses.
