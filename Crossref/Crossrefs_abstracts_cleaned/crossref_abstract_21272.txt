 Resilience and secure parental attachment have been proven as important factors to alleviate the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effects of the two factors on PTSD and the mechanisms of its effect at different time points in the aftermath of trauma are still unclear. This study explores the relationship among parental attachment, resilience, and development of PTSD symptoms in adolescents from a longitudinal perspective following the Yancheng Tornado. Using cluster sampling method, a total of 351 Chinese adolescents, survivors of a severe tornado, were tested on their PTSD, parental attachment and resilience at 12-months and 18-months after experiencing the natural disaster. The results showed that our proposed model fit the data well: Ï‡ 2/ df = 3.197, CFI = 0.967, TLI = 0.950, RMSEA = 0.079. It revealed that the resilience at 18-months partially mediated the relationship between parental attachment at 12-months and PTSD at 18-months. Research results showed that parental attachment and resilience are key resources for coping with trauma.
