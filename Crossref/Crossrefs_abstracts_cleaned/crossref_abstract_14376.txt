This study examined the effect of resilience on self-efficacy in students attending four-year universities living in Chungcheongbuk-do. For this study, frequency analysis of basic variables, correlation analysis to confirm the correlation between variables, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to analyze the effect between variables. The analysis results are as follows. First, as a result of analyzing the correlation between resilience and self-efficacy, the correlation between self-efficacy and resilience was found to be positive (+). Second, multiple regression analysis was conducted to verify the effect of resilience on self-efficacy of college students, and it was found that resilience, an independent variable, had a positive effect on self-efficacy and was statistically significant (=0.624 p<0.001). Through this study, it is important to lead college students to take appropriate actions in any given situation by increasing their self-efficacy through educational programs that improve their resilience.
