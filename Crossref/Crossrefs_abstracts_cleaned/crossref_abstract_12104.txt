It is critical to prepare appropriate responses and countermeasures against droughts caused by a complex hazard process as the range of its damage and duration are very large. In this study, 160 local governments in Korea evaluated drought resilience. A total of 18 qualitative and quantitative drought recovery indicators were selected to collect and analyze data from each region. Comparative analysis of indicators through regional drought assessment was conducted to derive results and present directions for enhancing resilience. Lastly, a resilience curve of drought that can utilize the results of the evaluation was suggested and applied to the actual region, and the results were analyzed. The proposed method can be expected to be used as a basic and essential resources to prepare various local government measures against drought.
