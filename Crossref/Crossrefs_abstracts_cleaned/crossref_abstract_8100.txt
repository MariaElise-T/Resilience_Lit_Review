A health professional requires resilience to be able to handle the depression, anxiety and stress, which may occur when they are in the field. Resilience is theability to tackle and overcome difficulties, with personal transformation and growth. Studies in undergraduate medical students have shown a difference in the stress scores of males and females, showing the possibility of gender difference in coping strategies and resilience. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess the resilience scores of undergraduate medical students and to find out the existence of gender differences in their resilience scores. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the first and second-year MBBS students of 18-25 years of age after obtaining informed consent and Institutional ethical clearance. All willing male and female students fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria formed the study participants. A standard resilience questionnaire was used to assess the resilience scores of the students and the male and female participants scores were noted separately. A total of of282 first and second-year undergraduate medical students participated in the study. A significantly higher percentage of female students had a high resilience score in comparison to male participants. Our study highlights the fact that females have a higher resilience compared to males. But still, the majority of male and female students are having moderate resilience. Thus, the future focus should be on the promotion of resilience-building measures to be taught to the students early in their medical curriculum to successfully tackle the stressful situations.
