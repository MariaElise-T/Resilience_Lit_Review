The coordination relationship between urban resilience and high-quality development is of paramount importance for improving disaster-alleviated resilient governance and sustainable development in response to the globalized crisis. However, few studies have investigated the coupling between urban resilience and high-quality development. Therefore, based on the analysis of the coupling and coordination mechanism between urban resilience and high-quality development, this paper innovatively calculates the indicators of urban resilience and high-quality development of 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Area (YRDA) from 2005 to 2020. Moreover, we explore the spatiotemporal patterns, evolution characteristics of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between urban resilience and high-quality development using the entropy method, coupling coordination model, kernel density estimation curve, and further analyze the influence factors with the spatial econometric models. The results revealed that urban resilience maintained a steady growth, while high-quality development displayed a trend of an initial increase and a subsequent decline. The coupling coordination degree continued to rise and the regional difference decreased conspicuously, manifesting a robust developing trend. From the perspective of spatial patterns, the coupling coordination degree, which was characterized by “being high in the east and low in the west, tended to be balanced in the north and south and was prominent in the middle of the distribution.” Furthermore, economic strength, industrial structure, transportation facilities, and government intervention exerted a dominant influence on the development of coupling coordination degree, resulting in the spatial spillover effects as well. This study can reveal the interactive relationship between urban resilience and high-quality development can as well as help Yangtze River Delta Area provide a benchmark for promoting economic and social development while focusing on prevention and control of risk.
