Abstract. Emerging adulthood represents a time of substantial change and unpredictability. Personal resiliency is defined as an ability to adapt and thrive in the face of challenging circumstances. This study evaluated the cross-cultural validity of a new Spanish translation of the Resiliency Scale for Young Adults (RSYA) using samples of 393 young adults (66.2% women) from Spain (ages 18–30 years, Mage = 25.88, SDage = 2.87) and 365 young adults (71.23% women) from Canada (ages 18–30 years, Mage = 18.56, SDage = 1.26). Results showed that scores on the Spanish RSYA demonstrated high internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, a sound three-factor structure, and partial scalar invariance. Overall, the RSYA translation is a promising theory-based measurement tool designed for use in Spanish young adult samples.
