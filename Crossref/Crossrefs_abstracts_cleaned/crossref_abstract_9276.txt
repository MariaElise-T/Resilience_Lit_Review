PurposeThis study investigates whether logistics and supply chain resilience strategies (SCREST) can help mitigate the negative impacts of disruptions on firm performance and logistics and supply chain (SC) activities of companies, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected primary data on the implementation of different types of SCRESTs and measured the impact of COVID-19 in terms of firm performance and logistics and SC metrics through a survey of Japanese manufacturing companies in four sectors. The authors used these data to illustrate whether the companies benefitted from SCRESTs in mitigating the negative impacts of COVID-19. A questionnaire comprising structured and open-ended questions was sent to 8,000 companies all over Japan that met the selection criteria, using a combination of mail and web-based media. The respondents were logistics and SC professionals. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed for data analysis and interpretation.FindingsResearch conducted within the case of the Japanese context revealed that findings varied depending on the methodology applied. The use of a direct analysis approach and qualitative analysis suggested that the implementation of SCRESTs is beneficial in addressing the negative impacts of COVID-19 on firm performance and logistics and SC activities, whereas the application of indirect analysis approach yielded mixed results. The analysis also indicated a shift in the preferred SCRESTs during COVID-19.Originality/valueTo the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first study to examine the benefits of implementing SCRESTs using primary data from the manufacturing sector of Japan. Furthermore, empirical research on this topic is generally lacking.
