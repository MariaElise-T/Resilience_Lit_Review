This study aims to analyze the relationship between supply chain resilience (SCR) practices and operational performance and the moderating role of digital technologies in Jordanian manufacturing firms. A descriptive-analytical approach was adopted using a questionnaire based on the study model and previous related literature. Four hundred supply chain (SC)-related managers within seventy-one firms were reached to collect the needed data; three hundred and seventy-two complete questionnaires were analyzed. The results revealed that the level of SCR practices and operational performance was high; SCR (with its sub-dimensions: SC agility (SCA), SC flexibility (SCF), and SC collaboration (SCC)) had a significant positive relationship with operational performance; and the appropriate use of digital technologies had a significant moderating impact on the aggregate level of the SCRâ€“operational performance relationship. Finally, research limitations, practical implications, and future research conclude this study.
