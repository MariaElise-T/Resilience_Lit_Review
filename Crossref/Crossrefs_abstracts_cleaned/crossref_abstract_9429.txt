The research on combat resilience is a new subject proposed in recent years. As a matter of fact, there is so far no complete theoretical system guiding the design for equipments combat resilience. Thus, using the integrated design theory and methodology based on the systematic engineering, the basic theory of the design for equipments combat resilience is putted forward and established in this paper. Meanwhile, the methods and procedures of the design for equipments combat resilience are proved by an example of the design of certain fighter landing gear for improving the combat resilience.
