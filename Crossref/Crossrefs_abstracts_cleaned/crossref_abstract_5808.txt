Abstract
Welfare status for any species is dependent upon an animal’s ability to cope with its environment. Environmental conditions, animal husbandry, and overall health are major components that contribute to managing livestock species with quality animal welfare. Previous approaches intending to create more robust animals have applied genetic selection, nutritional programming, or advancements in facilities. Engineered resilience, the approach explored here, represents: (a) the ability to identify certain physiological biomarkers, behaviors, and environmental stressors that contribute to the individual’s response to a challenge; and (b) manipulate them in a targeted way with well-timed and controlled exposure to improve outcomes of a challenge to homeostasis (i.e. improve fitness with prior conditioning). Foundational understanding of natural adaptation in response to challenge reveals that some animals emerge from a challenge with greater coping abilities and others fail to thrive. By determining which animals have natural resilience and exploring the factors that created desired outcomes, scenarios can be identified to initiate resilience in susceptible animals. Such responses can then be stimulated through the development of managerial techniques. This project was conducted by reviewing published literature with the goal of identifying more refined areas of study for future research in engineered resilience in livestock species. Potential for application of this concept includes building thermal resilience, social resilience, and disease resilience.
