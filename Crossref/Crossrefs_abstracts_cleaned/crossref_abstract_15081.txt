AbstractBackgroundHighly varying cognitive abilities among individuals facing pathological alterations, e.g. in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is conceptualized by the cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis[1]. The growing interest in prevention and intervention methods brings many new challenges for precision medicine[2]. Hereby, studies on the residual approach for estimating CR, i.e. cognitive resilience, are emerging[1], while the employed methods are highly variable among studies. We aim to develop a standardized and simplified clinical score that predicts CR individually.MethodCognitively normal (CN) and β‐amyloid(Aβ)‐negative n = 86 participants and n = 707 individuals with Aβ+ from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort ‐ADNI‐1/GO and 2‐ were included in the study. The Aβ+ group was stratified as CN+, mild cognitive impairment (MCI+) and AD dementia (ADD+) subgroups. A residual factor score (CR‐Factor) using principal component analyses was derived, including cognitive composite scores and continuous CSF‐Aβ and CSF‐phosphorylated‐tau. We predicted a CR‐Score through multinomial regression analysis on CR‐Factor, including the modified‐Preclinical‐Alzheimer‐Cognitive‐Composite score and CSF‐Aβ and CSF‐phosphorylated‐tau categories (normal, intermediate range ‐10% borderline towards abnormal values‐ and abnormal) as predictors (Figure‐1). The associations of the CR‐Score with baseline characteristics and longitudinal change in cognition were tested.ResultMultinomial regressions revealed that CR‐Score was positively associated with higher years of education in the entire cohort and subgroups, except ADD+. Moreover, higher CR‐Score was associated with younger age and female sex in CN+, younger age in MCI+ and inversely with Afro‐American race in the entire cohort (Table‐1). In linear mixed models, higher CR‐Scores predicted a slower increase of Clinical Dementia Rating‐sum of boxes in MCI+ and ADD+ and of AD‐Assessment‐Scale cognitive‐subscale‐13 in MCI+ (Figure‐2).ConclusionThe framework to derive a formula that operationalizes CR on an individual level might provide a simplified and yet effective method for clinical studies with patients in AD‐continuum, especially prodromal AD, where intervention is emphasized as appropriate[3]. Furthermore, a standardized marker among studies can promote the replicability and comparison of studies on residual methods.[1] Stern Y et al.
