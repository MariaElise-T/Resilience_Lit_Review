 In this article, we review and synthesize the empirical literature on career resilience (CR) to develop a nomological network that describes the major components of the construct, and its relationships with other constructs. Specifically, we outline the antecedents and consequences of CR and describe their theoretical basis. We discuss the implications of the nomological network for future research on CR. Finally, we describe the practical implications of our model for individuals, managers, and organizations.
