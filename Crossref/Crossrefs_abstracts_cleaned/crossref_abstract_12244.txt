Abstract
Floods are disasters that often hit cities in Indonesia. Even in certain cities, flooding is a recurring disaster. Kendari City is a service and trade city in Southeast Sulawesi Province which has a vulnerability to repeated flood disasters in urban areas including 10 Districts, which are still included in the Wanggu River Basin. This urban area experiences the phenomenon of urbanization, namely population growth and high land use change and land ownership transfer. The development of residential areas as a consequence of population growth, is also a cumulative factor triggering the flood disaster in the Wanggu River Basin. This study aims to determine the development of the expansion of flood areas in the Wanggu watershed in a time series (period 2007 - 2017) and how they impact the development of Kendari City. This research will also investigate the impact of land use change and the impact of urban population growth on the expansion of flood disasters. The method used is the collection of qualitative and quantitative data, observation, and verification in the field, to map analysis using High Resolution Satellite Imagery to determine changes in land use in the Wanggu watershed area. The expected outcome of this research is the mapping of areas that are vulnerable to the risk of flooding, especially in urban areas to the resilience strategy chosen as one of the cityâ€™s resilience efforts against disasters.
