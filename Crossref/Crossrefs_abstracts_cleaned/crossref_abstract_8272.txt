Referring to Walsh’s theoretical framework of family resilience while taking into account China’s own cultural and institutional context, this study discussed the process of resilience generation in Chinese families of children with ASD. A qualitative approach was taken, using narrative research on 10 Chinese families of children with ASD. Category-content analysis of the data suggests that the generation of resilience in Chinese families of children with ASD is influenced by four factors: (A) cultivating positive family beliefs; (B) adjustment of the family’s organizational pattern; (C) extending external resources positively; and (D) optimizing family communication. Unlike family resilience generation mechanisms in Western countries that emphasize religious beliefs, intrinsic traits, and resources, the resilience of Chinese families of children with ASD is based on a family value system based on a sense of responsibility and the application of internal and external family resources, which is undoubtedly related to China’s long-standing emphasis on collectivist culture. This study has theoretical reference value for the implementation of related social work services.
