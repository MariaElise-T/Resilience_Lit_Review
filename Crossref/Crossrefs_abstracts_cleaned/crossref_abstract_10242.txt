Nurses primarily focus on caring for others, but they also require care and support to enhance their own resilience. Thus, this study aims to determine the effects of psychological interventions on nurses’ resilience support and to define the influence of moderating variables that can affect these effects. The literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, and 5 randomized controlled trials and 10 non-randomized controlled trials were finally selected for analysis (a total of 852 participants). Statistical analyses of the effect sizes and homogeneity of the intervention programs were conducted using RevMan 5.3 from the Cochrane Library and the R program. Publication bias in the retrieved studies was tested using contour-enhanced funnel plots. The meta-analysis found that psychological interventions were effective in improving nurses’ resilience immediately after the intervention (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.86, Z = 4.18, p < 0.001) and in the short term within three months (SMD = 1.52, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.31, Z = 3.80, p < 0.001). Interventions using emotion regulation, relaxation, and self-compassion were particularly effective, and the intervention period was effective in both a short period of 1 day and a long period of more than 12 weeks. In addition, the optimal one-session time was 121–150 min, and offline interventions were more effective than online interventions. Furthermore, the effect size was affected by the intervention time for one session (QB = 12.02, df = 3, p = 0.007) and the on/offline intervention method (QB = 5.85, df = 1, p = 0.015). These findings may inform the development of targeted interventions and resilience support systems for nurses. However, in the future, more rigorous studies, such as randomized controlled trials, should be conducted to ensure strict control over the variables and to establish a stronger evidence base for the effectiveness of these interventions.
