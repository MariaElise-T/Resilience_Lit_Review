Background: Adolescence is a stage of transition with multiple changes and transformations. It is a critical phase to potentiate or disrupt the life course of human beings. In Latin America, adolescents and young adults from countries like Colombia have unequal access to socioeconomic resources, education, and the job market. This may generate social disadvantages and vulnerability. Aim: We aimed to identify conditions of social vulnerability and psychosocial resilience in the life course of adolescents and young adults from a community art network in Bogota, Colombia. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study with a multivocal design supported by the ethnic-social life history construction. The data were collected using narrative interviews. The interviews were transcribed, coded, categorized, and triangulated according to the principles of grounded theory as an analytical method. We adhered to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. Results: Eight adolescents and young adults between the ages of 12 and 24 years participated in the study. Five categories emerged: social vulnerability, social environment, artistic processes, psychosocial resilience, and life course. Conclusions: Social vulnerability and psychosocial resilience coexist during the life course of adolescents and young adults. Social support networks and community art processes have the potential to promote psychosocial resilience in adolescents and young adults.
