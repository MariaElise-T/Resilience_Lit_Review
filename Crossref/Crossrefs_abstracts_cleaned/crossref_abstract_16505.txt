How to assess the risk of flood disasters and improve the resilience of coastal cities has become a scientific problem that must be solved urgently. This paper aims to construct a resilience assessment model for transport systems in the context of climate change based on an analysis of the spatial characteristics of regional transport networks and complex network theory, using the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China as the empirical object. Other objectives of the developed model are to establish a system of homogeneity, efficiency, and stability indicators and to assess the impact of flood depth (up to 7 m) on the resilience of transport networks in terms of static network structure and dynamic network performance by designing flood inundation disturbance scenarios. Finally, the characteristics, change trends, and conceptual connotations of the resilience of transport networks in coastal cities are condensed. The results of this study provide a solid scientific basis for future flood disaster risk management in global coastal cities.
