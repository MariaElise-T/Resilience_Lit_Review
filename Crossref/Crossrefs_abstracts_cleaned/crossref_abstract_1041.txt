The aim of the current study is to investigate the level of risk-taking behavior, resilience and aggression in female volleyball players and the link between these psychological variables and coach’s performance ranking. A Romanian volleyball team ranked 7th out of 11 in the A1 league in the national championship (2022-2023 period) participated at the study. The Romanian adaptation of the Brief Resilience Scale, The Romanian adaptation of Makarowski’s Stimulating and Instrumental Risk Questionnaire, The Romanian adaptation of Makarowski's Aggression Questionnaire and Delphi method (evaluation of female volleyball players by coaches) were used. Analysis of the results reveals that athletes have a low level of perseverance (Go-Ahead factor), a low level of Foul play and a moderate to low level of assertiveness. Also, most athletes registered average or even low levels of resilience and have manifested a medium level of instrumental risk and moderate-to low-level of stimulating risk. The existing correlations between the psychological variables examined and the average scores obtained by each athlete (scores offered by the volleyball coaches according to athletes’ sport skills in training and competition) were discussed. The results of the study contribute to increase the awareness regarding aggression level, resilience, instrumental and stimulating risk level in Romanian female volleyball players, a less addressed topic.
