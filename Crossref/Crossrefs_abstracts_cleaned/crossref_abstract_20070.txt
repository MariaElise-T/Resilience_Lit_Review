Abstract
The huge amount of the available data nowadays has raised some major challenges which are related to the storage, fusion, structure, streaming and processing of these data. In this paper, we present the development of a holistic framework, entitled HARMONIA, that encompasses State-of-The-Art solutions for the emerging issues related to Climate Change, natural and/or man-made hazards and urban/peri-urban risks. The Horizon 2020 HARMONIA project is developing an Integrated Resilience Assessment Platform (IRAP) which plans to provide targeted services for different groups of end-users. In particular, it will actively support urban decision-makers in strategic decisions and planning and citizens in facing daily effects and risks of Climate Change. Additionally, the platform will be a place to interconnect cities which end up facing similar Climate Change effects. HARMONIA IRAP leverages cuttingedge technologies (i.e., explainable Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, multi-criteria analysis, dynamic programming) and services (ie., Virtual Machines, Containers) in order to provide solutions considering the complexity and diversity of extreme earth and non-earth data. In addition, this platform includes a Decision Support System providing early-warning feedback and recommendations to the end-users. In this way the HARMONIA IRAP design tends to address these challenges by offering the corresponding dynamic, scalable and robust mechanisms with the aim to provide useful integrated tools for the related users. Datacubes architecture, which is a major part of the IRAP, offers the opportunity to investigate more sophisticated correlations among the data and provide a more tangible representation of the extracted information.
