The findings suggest that perceived gratitude is positively related to employee resilience, while employee resilience is positively associated with work engagement. In addition, employee resilience mediates the relationship between perceived gratitude and work engagement. Based on the findings, outsourcing companies are encouraged to deliver workplace-perceived gratitude training to make their employees psychologically resilient, leading to more engagement at work.
