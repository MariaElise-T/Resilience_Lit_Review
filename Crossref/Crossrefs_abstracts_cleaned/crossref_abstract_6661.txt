Background:
Family resilience can be observed through specific resilience-promoting processes, namely, shared belief systems, communication, and organizational processes, but the concept remains mostly unstudied in neonatology. This metasummary aims to evaluate the frequency of family resilience processes in qualitative scientific literature to illustrate how family resilience is exhibited in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting.


Methods:
A search among 4 databases yielded 7029 results, which were reviewed for inclusion. Following Sandelowski and Barroso's qualitative metasummary method, findings from each study were independently coded and frequency effect size was calculated.


Results:
Forty-six primary qualitative studies published between 2016 and 2022 conducted with parents of preterm infants who discussed their NICU hospitalization experience were included in this metasummary. All 9 of Walsh's family resilience processes were identified in the literature, and their frequency effect size ranged from 4% to 91%. Four additional themes emerged pertaining to specific family resilience behaviors exhibited by NICU families.


Conclusion:
This analysis sheds new light on the most recent qualitative evidence of parents' experiences in the NICU by analyzing it through the lens of family resilience and posits family resilience as a promising concept in relation to the predominance of the family-centered care philosophy in neonatal units.
