Abstract
This paper reviews the emerging literature on food systems and food supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four themes are explored: consumer demand and retail market effects; supply-side shocks; food system and supply chain resilience; and developing countries and food insecurity. The effect of demand-side shocks is explored, including the sudden shift in expenditures from food service to food retail. Longer-run structural changes in the food retailing landscape include the expansion of online food delivery. The effect of supply-side shocks is examined extensively in the literature, including short-run adaptations as supply chains pivoted from the food service sector to food retail, along with supply-side disruptions due to labour force outbreaks of COVID-19. Resilience is a common theme in the literature, at both food system and food supply chain levels. While a variety of perspectives are offered, most assessments point to a surprising degree of resilience and adaptability, while identifying the points of vulnerability. The pandemic increased food insecurity through the effect on household incomes from reduced labour mobility, lockdowns, and a contraction in economic activity. These effects were particularly prominent among vulnerable populations in developing countries. Significant attention has been paid to the short- and medium-run effects of the pandemic on food systems, with further research needed to understand any longer-term structural changes that may arise. The COVID-19 pandemic offers lessons for the robustness of food systems and the importance of timely, well-informed policy responses in preparation for future global shocks.
