Background: Endogenous and exogenous factors impact the operational characteristics of supply chains, affecting wholesale warehouses. The survival of a warehouse is often threatened by disruptive events that alter infrastructure and performance. The emergence of COVID-19 exemplified the need for adaptability in retail goods supply chains, emphasizing the necessity for responding to external shocks. Methods: The MARLIN (Method wArehouse ResiLience dIstruptioN) method, founded on theories and models of resilience engineering is introduced. MARLIN is a practical tool designed to identify key areas requiring intervention in response to disruptive events. An empirical test was conducted in an Italian warehouse. Results: The conducted test yielded tangible results, demonstrating the efficacy of the method. It successfully pinpointed areas necessitating intervention and identified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with disruptions. The study not only underscores the importance of data collection but also highlights the often-overlooked significance of warehouse management. Conclusions: The study establishes MARLIN as a valuable asset for stakeholders involved in disruption management. Its application has proven instrumental in recognizing areas of intervention and identifying KPIs related to disruptions. Ongoing research endeavors to broaden its applicability across diverse supply chain scenarios, aiming to enhance situational awareness and enable proactive risk assessment through what-if analysis.
