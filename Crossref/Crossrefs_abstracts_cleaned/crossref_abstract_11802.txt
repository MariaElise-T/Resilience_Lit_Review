Introduction:
Resilience is a person's capacity to overcome adversity. The purpose was to determine what patient factors correlate with resilience using the Brief Resilience Score. We hypothesize that characteristics of female sex, younger age, Workers’ Compensation status, and preoperative opioid use are predictors of a lower preoperative resilience score and that patients with positive psychosocial factors would have higher resilience scores.


Methods:
Eight hundred nine patients undergoing knee or shoulder arthroscopy were preoperatively categorized into low, normal, and high-resilience groups. Preoperative patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and demographics were assessed. Statistical analyses evaluated differences in demographics and PROMs between resilience groups.


Results:
Analysis disclosed notable differences between low, normal, and high-resilience groups regarding demographics and PROMs. High resilience was seen in older patients, male patients, and patients with positive psychosocial factors. Low resilience scores were discovered in Workers’ Compensation patients and those with a history of preoperative opioid use. No difference in resilience scores was observed between smokers and nonsmokers.


Discussion:
Preoperative resilience score is associated with age, sex, preoperative opioid use, Workers' Compensation status, and smoking status of patients undergoing knee or shoulder arthroscopy.
