In the situation where the global supply chain crisis is prolonged and constant, systematic management of risks is an essential factor to mitigate corporate instability and improve performance. This study investigates the relationship between supply chain risk management(structure, culture, cooperation), supply chain resilience(agility, robustness) and supply chain performance. For this purpose, a survey was conducted on 300 domestic manufacturing companies and data were collected from 101 companies. The collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS program. The research results are as follows. First, the risk management structure of supply chain risk management had a significant positive effect on agility and robustness, which are the supply chain resilience. Second, culture of supply chain risk management had a significant positive effect on agility, but it did not have a statistically significant effect on robustness. Third, supply chain cooperation did not have a statistically significant effect on agility and it had a significant positive effect on robustness. Fourth, agility and robustness, which are the components of supply chain resilience, have a significant positive effect on supply chain performance. The results of this study suggest an integrated model that can understand the relationship between the two concepts and supply chain performance at a time when it is important to strengthen the capacity of supply chain risk management and resilience, and can contribute academically and practically as data that can broaden the base of supply chain management theme and predict supply chain performance and change.
