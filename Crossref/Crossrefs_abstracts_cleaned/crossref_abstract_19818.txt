Phenotypic plasticity underlies much of the variation in life‐history expression in fishes. An understanding of potential constraints on life‐history plasticity thus may be critical for assessing the resiliency of populations or species to environmental change. Here, several evolutionary hypotheses are formulated for why a depleted lineage of Canadian Atlantic salmon Salmo salar populations continues to express an apparently maladaptive life history in the face of severe marine mortality. These hypotheses include: (1) reduced genetic variability for expressing plasticity, (2) constraints from genetic architecture, (3) constraints from gene flow, (4) phylogenetic constraints or irreversible evolutionary transitions, (5) environmental constraints to plasticity and (6) a restriction to population rescue from evolutionary‐demographic feedbacks. This S. salar lineage is intriguing to consider for understanding resilience or the lack thereof, because it has life‐history attributes that should favour resilience (e.g. a high degree of iteroparity, variable age at maturity and the presence of both long‐ and short‐distance migration ecotypes). In particular, the discussion centres on the question of why S. salar females, in contrast to males, do not adopt a non‐anadromous life history and mature in fresh water, given extremely high marine mortality among anadromous individuals of both sexes. A salient implication, with possibly significant conservation ramifications, is that fishes may exhibit substantial plasticity and potential for adapting to environmental change, but still be incapable of responding to certain environmental changes due to sex‐specific constraints to life‐history plasticity.
