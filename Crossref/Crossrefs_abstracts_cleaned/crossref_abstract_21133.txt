The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption to the lives of American Indian (AI) adolescents. While reservation-area AI youth already have a higher risk of substance use (SU) compared to their non-AI peers, COVID-19 stressors likely exacerbated this risk. However, COVID-19-specific and general resilience factors may have buffered against increased SU over the course of the pandemic. Using a person-centered, ecosystemic framework of resilience, we used latent profile analysis to identify ecosystemic resilience profiles indicated by general and COVID-19-specific risk and resilience factors, then examined inter-profile changes in alcohol and cannabis use after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic from the spring of 2020 to the spring of 2021. The sample was 2218 reservation-area AI adolescents (7â€“12th grade; schools = 20; Mage = 15, SD = 1.7; 52% female). Four profiles emerged: Average Risk and Resilience, High Resilience, Low Resilience, and High Risk. Adolescents with a High-Risk profile demonstrated increases in alcohol and cannabis use, while High Resilience youth demonstrated decreases. These findings support the hypothesized COVID-19-specific ecosystemic resilience profiles and the application of a person-centered ecosystemic framework to identify which AI adolescents are most likely to experience substance use changes during a life-altering crisis like COVID-19.
