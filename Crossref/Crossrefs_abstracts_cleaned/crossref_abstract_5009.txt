In addition to the references listed at the end of each article, there are a range of further sources that may be of relevance to those interested in social capital, social networks, and resilience, and their relation to child and family policy. Whilst the articles in this journal relate to a number of empirical issues, the references given here are intentionally broad in focus. These sources are in addition to those discussed in detail by Barnes and Prior in this edition.
