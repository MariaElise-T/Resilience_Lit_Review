Abstract
Due to the increase in the digitalization on board ships, the potential consequences of a cyber-induced incident can threaten the safety of the ships. A known challenge in the maritime industry is communication between ship owner management onshore and the crew on board a ship, especially during incident handling. To mitigate this issue and enhance cooperation in the digital age, crew and ship owner management need to meet, train for, and discuss cyber risks and their challenges. One way to enhance cohesive teams and effective communication is through the application of a human-centred design (HCD) approach to holistic team training. This paper proposes how simulator instructors should utilise HCD for the development of maritime cyber resilience training, tailored to a variety of maritime stakeholders including shipâ€™s crew and onshore support personnel. To do this, this paper will explore relevant learning theories and current maritime and cyber-related training methods. The paper will then demonstrate, through a practical application, the effectiveness of adopting HCD when designing maritime cyber resilience training. This application will argue that maritime simulators present an effective training solution for new cyber-related incidents. The authors demonstrate the application of HCD by showcasing a ballast water handling system cyber incident designed for the simulator. The development of such a training resource allows all participants to experience the consequences of a cyber-attack in a safe environment whilst enhancing their ability to respond (i.e. communicate with each other) effectively.
