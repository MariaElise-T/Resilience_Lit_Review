When modern societies face disasters, the goal of restoring to a pre-disaster state is minimal and disaster management is essential. However, a society that has faced and overcome disasters is a more developed society that prepares for new disasters and dreams of a safer and more sustainable social capacity. Disaster resilience, which is social resilience against new, inexperienced, and unpredictable complex and diverse disasters, lies in the organic connection of human, institutional, material, and social capital in the local community and in the disaster management system. The need for research on the core system, which is a key inspection system leading in a desirable direction, is becoming more important. Exploring how the values, institutions, leadership, followership, and capacity of the core system affect the strengthening of community disaster resilience is ultimately a disaster that focuses community capacity on disaster management, resulting in recovery, adaptation, and development. It will be a major way to evaluate the management system and judge its usefulness.
