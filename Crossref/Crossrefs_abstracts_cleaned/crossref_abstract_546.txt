Covid-19 poses the greatest challenges for effective leadership in many years. Covid-19 undermines the deepest security we feelas humans and disables people’s capacity to work and create. This opinion piece argues that leaders should not merely hold on until Covid-19 passes, but rather learn the lessons Covid-19 wishes to teach us. In so doing, leaders become resilient to adversity and can facilitate the resilience of employees, teams, and organisations. This article addresses these lessons in relation to our common humanity, the centrality of relationships, the vital importance of spirituality, and the need for structure to enable productivity.
