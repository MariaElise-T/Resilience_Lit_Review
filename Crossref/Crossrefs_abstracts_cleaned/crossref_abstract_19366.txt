AbstractThe Ego Resilience scale (ER) and The Ego Undercontrol scale (EUC) are designed to assess personality types based on how people inhibit or express their emotional impulses. The study aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of both scales. Two community samples were recruited through convenience sampling and were informed about the study either while attending an undergraduate class at University or through advertisement on the Internet. For the two samples respectively, 483 and 197 individuals aged 18â€“70 completed the self-rating questionnaires via a website. In the first sample, factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity of the ER and the EUC were evaluated and a shorter version of the EUC (EUC-13) was developed based on the outcome. In the second sample, factor structure and psychometric properties of the EUC-13 were analyzed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported both the original version of the ER and the EUC-13. Both instruments showed satisfactory levels of internal consistency for all subscales but Socially restrained behavior from the EUC-13, good test-retest reliability, as well as satisfactory preliminary evidence of validity. Further validation studies are recommended, such as investigating the scales in clinical settings.
