The purpose of the present work is to use an explicit finite element code to model the impact behavior of a heavyweight impact source like rubber ball and to predict the floor impact vibration of resilient materials, which are used in the floor coverings construction for sound insulation. To simulate the impact force of rubber balls, the hyperviscoelastic rubber model is applied. Then, this rubber model is used in the simulation for the impact vibration of resilient materials. The results indicate that the hyperviscoelastic rubber model could precisely simulate the impact force of rubber balls, as its two parameters are properly chosen according to the desired impact force. Also, the present model could capture the impact and vibration behavior of the considered materials and reasonably evaluate the insulation effect of resilient materials.
