 BACKGROUND: The 10-item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) has demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties as a measure of resilience in all the previous studies conducted in developed countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the psychometric characteristics of the 10-item CD-RISC among students nurses in southwestern Nigeria. DESIGN: This descriptive cross-sectional study involved a total of 449 student nurses who completed the 10-item CD-RISC in addition to measures of self-esteem, depression, religiosity, and psychological distress. RESULTS: The scale demonstrated adequate reliability (Cronbach’s α = .81) and satisfactory validity with significant correlations with the measures of self-esteem, depression, religiosity, and psychological distress. Factor analyses revealed that resilience was best explained by a two-factor construct. CONCLUSIONS: The scale is a valid measure of resilience among Nigerian student nurses.
