Background: The aim of the present study was to describe the resilience levels in a Spanish population during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to analyze the existing associations between high resilience and socio-demographic, work, and academic parameters. Method: 1176 individuals aged 18â€“67 years participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study. The participants were administered the 10-item resilience scale developed by Connor-Davidson (CD-RISC-10) and an ad-hoc questionnaire that collected information on socio-demographic, work, and academic variables. Basic descriptive data were used to statistically analyze the data, and a binary logistic regression model was developed incorporating the professional occupation, academic level, whether the respondent worked in emergency services, and whether the respondent had dependents. Results: Slightly more than a quarter of the participants showed low resilience, almost half reported moderate resilience, and slightly more than a quarter had high resilience. Those who were employed were 2.16-times more likely to have high resilience, whilst those with higher education were 1.57-times more likely. Those working in emergency services were 1.66-times more likely, and those with dependents were 1.58-times more likely to have high resilience. Conclusion: In addition to the relationships found, a need to improve the resilience levels in the population was found.
