This study explored the intricate interplay between healthcare workers' resilience and their overall workplace happiness. Additionally, it delved into the mediating role of work-life balance in this relationship and the moderating influence of social support. Data from 275 healthcare worker respondents were collected through an online survey conducted between September 5 and November 30, 2022, and analyzed using SPSS/WIN 27.0 and Process Macro v3.5. The key findings are as follows: First, significant positive correlations existed among workplace happiness, resilience, work-life balance, and social support. Second, Work-life balance played a vital mediating role, significantly enhancing the connection between resilience and workplace happiness. Resilient individuals exhibited improved work-life balance, positively affecting their happiness at work. Third, the mediation was influenced by social support levels; as support decreased, work-life balance's impact on happiness strengthened, while resilience maintained a substantial indirect effect. These findings provide valuable insights into the well-being of healthcare workers and underscore the critical roles played by both resilience and social support in enhancing workplace happiness.
