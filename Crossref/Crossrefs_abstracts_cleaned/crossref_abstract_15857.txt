ABSTRACT

            Critical to microbial versatility is the capacity to express the cohort of genes that increase fitness in different environments.
            Legionella pneumophila
            occupies extensive ecological space that includes diverse protists, pond water, engineered water systems, and mammalian lung macrophages. One mechanism that equips this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to fluctuating conditions is a switch between replicative and transmissive cell types that is controlled by the broadly conserved regulatory protein CsrA. A striking feature of the legionellae surveyed is that each of 14 strains encodes 4 to 7
            csrA
            -like genes, candidate regulators of distinct fitness traits. Here we focus on the one
            csrA
            paralog (
            lpg1593
            ) that, like the canonical
            csrA
            , is conserved in all 14 strains surveyed. Phenotypic analysis revealed that long-term survival in tap water is promoted by the
            lpg1593
            locus, which we name
            csrR
            (for “
            Csr
            A-similar protein for
            r
            esilience”). As predicted by its GGA motif,
            csrR
            mRNA was bound directly by the canonical CsrA protein, as judged by electromobility shift and RNA-footprinting assays. Furthermore, CsrA repressed translation of
            csrR
            mRNA
            in vivo
            , as determined by analysis of
            csrR-gfp
            reporters,
            csrR
            mRNA stability in the presence and absence of
            csrA
            expression, and mutation of the CsrA binding site identified on the
            csrR
            mRNA. Thus, CsrA not only governs the transition from replication to transmission but also represses translation of its paralog
            csrR
            when nutrients are available. We propose that, during prolonged starvation, relief of CsrA repression permits CsrR protein to coordinate
            L. pneumophila
            's switch to a cell type that is resilient in water supplies.
          

IMPORTANCE
            Persistence of
            L. pneumophila
            in water systems is a public health risk, and yet there is little understanding of the genetic determinants that equip this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to and survive in natural or engineered water systems. A potent regulator of this pathogen's intracellular life cycle is CsrA, a protein widely distributed among bacterial species that is understood quite well. Our finding that every sequenced
            L. pneumophila
            strain carries several
            csrA
            paralogs—including two common to all isolates—indicates that the legionellae exploit CsrA regulatory switches for multiple purposes. Our discovery that one paralog, CsrR, is a target of CsrA that enhances survival in water is an important step toward understanding colonization of the engineered environment by pathogenic
            L. pneumophila
            .
