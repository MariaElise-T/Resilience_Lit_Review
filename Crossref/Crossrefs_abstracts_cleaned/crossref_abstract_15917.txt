AbstractThe study examined whether online and offline social capital and offline social support are associated with less perceived stress in 403 undergraduate Greek college students through the mediating role of resilience and life satisfaction. Gender differences were also explored. A path analysis explored the relationships among the study variables and multi‚Äêgroup analysis explored gender differences. Perceived stress was predicted indirectly by offline social support and offline bonding social capital through resilience and life satisfaction and directly by online bonding. However, offline bonding was associated with reduced resilience and life satisfaction, whereas social support was associated with increased levels of both. Interestingly, whereas offline bonding was associated with reduced perceived stress through resilience for women, for men it occurred through life satisfaction, and it was primarily resilience for women and life satisfaction for men that predicted reduced perceived stress. It was concluded that different personal ties/relationships are associated with perceived stress through diversified pathways and the pathways are different for men and women. Offline social support between closely tied persons is positively associated and offline bonding is negatively associated with the inner resources for a person to cope with stress, whereas online bonding is beneficial in directly decreasing stress.
