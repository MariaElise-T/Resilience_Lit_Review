Students' online learning environment and academic resilience are indicators of academic success in online learning. This study determined the level of perception in an online learning environment and academic resilience concerning students' performance in Mathematics among Junior High School students at Misamis University, Ozamis City, during the first quarter of the school year 2021-2022. The researchers used the descriptive-correlational research design. The respondents were 148 Junior High School students chosen by simple random sampling. The instruments used were the Students' Online Learning Environment Questionnaire (SOLEQ) and the Students' Academic Resilience Questionnaire (SARQ). Mean, standard deviation, Pearson r, and Stepwise Regression Analysis were the statistical tools used. Findings revealed that students had a high level of perception in their online learning environment and had high academic resilience in their online learning. They performed very satisfactorily in their online class. There was a significant relationship between the students' online learning environment in terms of computer usage, teacher support, and student autonomy and their academic performance in Mathematics. In the students' online learning environment, there was no significant relationship between the other variables and their academic achievement in Mathematics. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the students' academic resilience and their academic performance in Mathematics. Computer Usage predicted students' academic performance in Mathematics. Teachers need to be technologically proficient in using technology as an educational tool. School administrators conduct online seminars, trainings, and workshops regarding technical literacy. Future researchers must look into other factors contributing to the student's academic performance in online learning.
