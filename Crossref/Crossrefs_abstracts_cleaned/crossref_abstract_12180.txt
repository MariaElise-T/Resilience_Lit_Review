 Improving teacher retention and resiliency are key educational problems. In this article, we share findings from case studies of six educators who, for over 200 combined years, worked in urban, high-poverty schools and highlight what teachers need to remain in such contexts. We argue that developing professional resilience is a process built on the interplay between individuals and their supportive contexts. In-depth interviews with these six educators reveal how connections with educator networks such as the National Writing Project (NWP) helped teachers develop into durable and reflective practitioners by providing them technical expertise, cultural support, and opportunities to develop as leaders.
