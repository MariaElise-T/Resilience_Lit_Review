AbstractThe current food system is directly influenced by the increase in environmental problems and nutritional inequality globally. Financial and political collapses, health crises, excessive urbanization, and rapid industrialization are some of the principal factors threatening the food supply's security. The food system needs a profound transformation to avoid ecosystem destabilization and a global food crisis. Concerning this transformation, we are certain that the first step for a successful food system change is global resilience thinking. To reach an integrated food system, we proposed introducing the resilient concept linked with other known concepts, such as circular economy and sustainability. A resilient food system can recover over time, ensuring the supply of sustainable and quality food and access to all. This would mean redesigning the value chains in the food system, re‐educating consumers to implement a healthier diet, and introducing technology such as digital innovation. Re‐evaluating these relevant points, redesigning the focus of the food system, not only for economic efficiency but also including significant trade‐offs, or valuing other services in the food system, are essential to reaching the desired resilience. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.
