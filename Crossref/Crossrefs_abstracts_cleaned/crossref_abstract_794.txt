This thematic issue of <em>Urban Planning</em> focuses on recent transformations of the built environment, the economy, and society around the world. The articles examine how planning processes and policy responses can adapt to the transformation of metropolitan areas in the pursuit of a more just and resilient society. Key themes are centered on socio-spatial processes that drive the uneven growth, the economic globalization of cities and the pursuant human migration, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Collectively, the authors engage in a scholarly conversation about the future of the resilient metropolis in an era of decentralization.
