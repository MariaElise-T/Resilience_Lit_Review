We herein investigated the relationship between psychological status and the various emotions of medical staff during the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, the convenience sampling method was used to select medical staff members as participants, and a cross-sectional study design was implemented. The instruments included the Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ-36), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the self-rated 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). In total, 876 medical staff members were selected in this study. The CD-RISC-10 was negatively correlated with all other scales (P &lt; 0.01). The hierarchical regression coefficients of the SAS and QIDS-SR16 against the BCSQ-36 mediated by the CD-RISC-10 were P &lt; 0.01, and the significance of the F values in all hierarchical regression equations was P &lt; 0.01 (Sobel test, P &lt; 0.01). Medical staff burnout during the COVID-19 epidemic was affected by anxiety and depression, and psychological resilience had a mediating role. Attending to changes in the negative emotions of medical staff and improving their psychological resilience are beneficial to alleviate job burnout.
