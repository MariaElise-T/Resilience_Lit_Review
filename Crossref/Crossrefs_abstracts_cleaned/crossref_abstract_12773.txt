The study was conducted to assess the post 2010 flood risk management and resilience-building practices in District Layyah, Pakistan. Exploratory research was applied to gain knowledge of flood risk management to embed the disaster risk reduction, mitigation, and adaptation strategies at the local government and community level. Around 200 questionnaires were collected from the four devastated areas/union councils. Primary data from the field uncovered flood risk management practices by organizations, local government, and the community. It highlights resilience-building practices undertaken by the community through rehabilitation, community participation, and local indigenous practices. The role of the District Layyahâ€™s local government and organizations to mitigate the 2010 flood and their contribution towards flood resilience in affected communities was investigated, as no comparable studies were carried out in the riverine belt of District Layyah previously. Moreover, the tangible and non-tangible measures to lessen the vulnerability to floods and improve flood risk governance at a local level were identified. This study makes a valuable contribution in strengthening the resilience building of vulnerable communities by recommending few changes in existing practices concerning flood risk at a local level.
