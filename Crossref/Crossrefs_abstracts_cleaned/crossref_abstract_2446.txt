Systems of Pain/Networks of Resilience (Nebraska) is a performance for camera. Chapters of the work have developed in Omaha, Nebraska, upstate New York, Galesburg, Illinois and Santa Fe, New Mexico. (Nebraska) is the first chapter, originally performed live at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts. Within the project, pain is understood as trauma, loss, disruption—everything from polluted landscapes to neglect, from abusive relationships to work stress. Resilience is similarly embraced in an expansive, cross-disciplinary way, invoking everything from the ability of an ecosystem to adapt to disruption, to a human’s ability to cope with traumatic events.
