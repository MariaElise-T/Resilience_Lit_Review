ABSTRACTThis study aims to explore the transition of the term “digital library” through a thematic mapping of published literature. To reach this purpose, we conducted a network analysis on the retrieved bibliographic dataset from the Scopus database. From 985 documents total of 77 high‐frequency keywords have been selected. Co‐occurrence of the top 20 keywords has been identified to get indicative themes. Among the top 20 high‐frequency keywords, the term “human” is identified as an emerging term based on the average publication year 2017. The terms from the blue‐colored cluster are “human”, “disease” “diagnosis” and many more to support information resiliency due to expanding areas in the context of the digital library.
