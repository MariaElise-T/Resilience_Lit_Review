AbstractAimsThis study examines the impact of personal resilience on the well‐being of care workers and how perceptions of the quality of care provided and the social climate in the organization influences this relationship. We examine quality of patient care as both a mediating and outcome variable to better understand if ‘doing good’ (quality of care) leads to ‘feeling good’ (personal well‐being).BackgroundAs an ageing population and the care for the older people has become an increasing challenge to many societies, developing and retaining a professional care workforce through effective management is vital in providing care services.DesignA cross‐sectional regression design was used in the study.MethodsIn 2017 we surveyed care workers in 20 Australian aged care facilities. The sample consist of 194 usable questionnaires. Using regression techniques, we constructed an interaction term (resilience × social climate) and investigated its impact on well‐being (the outcome variable) and quality of care (the mediator variable).ResultsOur results reveal that quality of care is important as an outcome variable particularly in a supportive climate where high personal resilience positively influences quality of care. Quality of care is also important as a mediating variable as it provides a conduit through which high personal resilience fosters well‐being, especially in a supportive climate. Our results support the argument that ‘doing good’ leads to ‘feeling good’.ConclusionThese findings contribute to our appreciation of the important outcomes of resilience in the aged care context and its influence on perceived performance and carer well‐being.
