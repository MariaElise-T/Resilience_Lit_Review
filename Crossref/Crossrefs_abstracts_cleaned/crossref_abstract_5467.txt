Abstract: the article is devoted to researching the resources of resilience of future psychologists engaged in volunteer activities in the field of providing psychological assistance to victims of military aggression. The research is focused on studying the level of resilience and coping mechanisms that ensure the ability of future psychologists to adapt in conditions of constant emotional stress. 50 future psychologists aged 18-22 took part in the study, who were divided into two groups depending on the presence or absence of volunteer experience during martial law. It was found that future psychologists who are engaged in volunteer activities mainly rely on cognitive and behavioral coping and do not use emotional coping enough, which may indicate their unwillingness to work with their own emotions.
