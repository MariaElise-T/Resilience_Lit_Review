 This research examined the associations between resilience, fear of COVID-19, coronavirus anxiety and COVID-19 burnout. The study also aimed to validate the COVID-19 Burnout Scale (COVID-19-BS) in Urdu. Participants included 812 Pakistani young adults (55.7% males; mean age 26.4 Â± 8.7 years). Results supported a one-factor solution for the COVID-19-BS with high reliability. Mediation analysis showed that resilience mediated the relationships between fear of COVID-19 and coronavirus anxiety with COVID-19 burnout. The study provided preliminary evidence that fear of COVID-19 and coronavirus anxiety might be significant risk factors for burnout among the Pakistani general population, and resilience might mitigate the impacts of these factors.
