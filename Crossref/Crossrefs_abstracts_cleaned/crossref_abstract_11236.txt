The purpose of this research is to develop the residential flood hazard information map using Geographical Information System (GIS) for residential community resilience. The review approach is based on related literature contributing to identifying themes such as “flood hazard information map” and “geographical information system”. Integration of data will be sourced from Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) and Jabatan Ukur dan Pemetaan Malaysia (JUPEM) using Unique Parcel Identifier (UPI) for respective residential land parcels. An extensive review of previous studies of flood hazard information map of residential community resilience for different flood disaster studies is considered to be the main restrictive factor resulting in a lack of empirical studies in this field. The development of residential property needs to be imposed with the elements for building specifications and materials that have flood resistance and resilience to protect the community life and property.Keywords: Community resilience, Floods, Geographical Information System (GIS), Residential propertyeISSN: 2398-4287 © 2019.
