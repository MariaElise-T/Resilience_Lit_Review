 With the aim of providing evidence about doctor-managers’ resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, this study analyzes the characteristics of 114 doctor-managers operating within the Italian National Health Service (NHS). During the emergency, doctor-managers had to show adaptive capacities to deal with unexpected situations and develop new paradigms, procedures, and quick responses to patients’ needs. This is in line with resilience, and in this perspective, it is crucial to investigate resilience determinants. The paper, therefore, provides an identikit of the resilient doctor-manager. The research was conducted between November and December 2020. Primary data were collected through an online questionnaire consisting of six sections. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Data were analyzed using quantitative techniques and employing Stata 16. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was employed to test construct validity and scale reliability. Results show that increasing levels of individual resilience are related to increasing levels of managerial identity. Moreover, physicians’ individual resilience has a positive association with commitment, knowledge diffusion, and Evidence-Based Medicine adoption. Finally, physicians’ individual resilience has a negative association with their role in the university, their specialty, and their gender. The study suggests some practical implications for healtcare organizations. In general, career paths are decided primarily on competency assessment, while an important role should be devoted to behavioral characteristics. Furthermore, organizations should take care of the levels of individual commitment and encourage professional networking because both help doctor-managers cope with uncertainty. The originality of the study relies on a fresh look at all previous work. There are currently few contributions in the literature to explore and investigate resilience elements in doctor-managers during the pandemic era.
