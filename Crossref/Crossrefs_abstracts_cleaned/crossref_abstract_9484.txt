 Research Spotlight:  Breaking new ground in crisis management, our study unveils the game-changing power of social media for community leaders. Scrutinizing social media posts from U.S. governors and supported by controlled experiments, we’ve delivered tangible tips for supercharging their messages, increasing effectiveness by 12%.  Wondering how we gauge effectiveness? It’s all about the community heeding government advice. Picture a governor issuing a hurricane warning on Twitter, urging locals to take cover or flee. Our study reveals a secret weapon for boosting compliance: embedding resilience in social media messages. This approach enables leaders to convince residents taking shelter or evacuating, a potentially lifesaving tactic in our era of escalating natural disasters. The benefits don’t stop at safety. Leaders wielding resilience messages can also win hearts, earning themselves a reputation as charismatic inspirations in their community. Saving lives and gaining popularity at the same time!  Harnessing cutting-edge Large Language Models (i.e. ChatGPT and its AI siblings), we developed a tool for leaders to analyze content and craft effective social media posts for crisis management before going live.
