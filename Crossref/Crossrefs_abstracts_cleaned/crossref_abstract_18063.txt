 Urbanisation and climate change have increased both the probability and the severity of flooding. The risk paradigm that follows shifts from traditional to more integrated approaches, since one of the main tasks emerging for flood managers is the development of resilient cities. The concept of urban resilience is becoming more and more important, despite the numerous challenges that interfere with its implementation. The goal of this research is to study how engineering and other design disciplines can improve flood resilience on an urban neighbourhood scale. This paper presents the analysis of an overview of research aimed at operationalising urban resilience to floods. This literature highlights the fact that almost no references can be found concerning studies focused on operationalising flood resilience at the neighbourhood level and particularly through urban design practices. Indeed, through interviews conducted with several stakeholders, it was confirmed that clear cooperation between flood resilience and urban design practices at the neighbourhood level does not yet exist.
