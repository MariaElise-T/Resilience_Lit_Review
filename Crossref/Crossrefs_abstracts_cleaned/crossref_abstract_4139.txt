Nature-based Solutions (NbS) as an integrated approach comprehensively provide basis of action to sustainably conserve and manage landscapes and create multi-benefits to society and living organisms, such as; biodiversity and biocultural benefits. NbS to societal challenges are adaptively planned via institutions to deliver benefits to communities. It is taking the capacity of different sectors and actors including local and indigenous people for decision-making into consideration. The result indicates practically all types of ecosystems receive benefits from NbS activities to enhance ecosystem goods and services to society and reduce societal challenges to climate change and biodiversity decline. Well-defined NbS may contribute to ecosystems resilience, connectivity and conservation, and support sustainable development goals programs. Thus, the resilient NbS that consider immediate challenges of ecosystem disconnectivity, biodiversity loss, climate impact and unsustainable development, would sustain ecosystem well-being and human health together for now and future.
