Sustainability and resilience are important in social, economic and environmental aspects. However, inspections
show that in developing countries like Iran, sustainability and resilience strategies lose their significance when economic
problems and high workload come to matter. This research tries to determine what factors encourage managers to consider airport sustainability 
in long-term and different situations. Such investigations are essential for a developing country
like Iran, which has 54 airports under a central management system, which can help deploying selected strategies. Results
of this study show that if passengers perceive the sustainability activities and ethical cores of an airport, they consider it
more prestigious and become willing to reuse airport services for their future travels. They also turn out as evangelists
and changes of the way people travel becomes visible on a wider scale. This can help managers to understand recent travel
behaviour of airport passengers and enhance the airportsâ€™ performance considering different aspects equally, which are
profitable for airport system, public and environment as a whole.
