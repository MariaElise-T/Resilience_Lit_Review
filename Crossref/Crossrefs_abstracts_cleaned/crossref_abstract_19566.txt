Resilience has been defined as one’s ability to maintain a mental health state and overall well-being when undergoing grave stress or facing significant adversity. Numerous resilience-investigating research tools have been developed over the years, with the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), a self-rated tool presenting valuable psychometric properties, remaining one of the most prominent. We aimed to translate and validate the brief CD-RISC-10 in a convenience sample of 584 nurses in Greece’s secondary and tertiary health care system. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis and known-groups validity test and estimated the reliability of the CD-RISC-10. Our confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the scale had a unifactorial structure since all the model fit indices were very good. Moreover, the reliability of the CD-RISC-10 was very good since the acquired Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega were 0.924 and 0.925, respectively. Therefore, the Greek version of the CD-RISC-10 confirmed the factor structure of the original scale and had very good validity and reliability.
