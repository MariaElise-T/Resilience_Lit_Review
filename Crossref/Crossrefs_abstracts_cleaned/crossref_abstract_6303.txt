In order to strengthen the ability of riverside urban communities to cope with flood disasters, the evaluation indicators of flood resilience of riverside urban communities are constructed by literature review and field investigation, and the relationship network was constructed by the matrix of interaction among indicators. The social network analysis (SNA) indexes are used to measure and analyze the relationship of the constructed indicators network from the dimension of overall network and individual indicator. The results of indexes show that location, business type, business density, non-vulnerable groups, population density, ability to eliminate stagnant water, building density, and disaster relief are the key indicators among all the indicators. Therefore, locating risk groups, strengthening rescue and evacuation capacity, and building rainwater blocking and restoring facilities are of great importance to improve the flood resilience of riverside urban communities.
