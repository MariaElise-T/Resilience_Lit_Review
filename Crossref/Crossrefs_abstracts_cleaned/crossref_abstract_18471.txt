Abstract
Cropland expansion and agriculture intensification have been the primary methods to increase food production since the 19th century. The resulting landscape simplification, however, can impede long-term agricultural crop productivity. This paper examines the role of landscape diversification on resilience of corn, soy, and winter wheat production, in terms of crop yield and yield variability, in the state of Kansas. The study uses panel data analysis with county fixed effects and time trends to estimate the relationship between landscape diversity and crop production resilience. Results show that diversity has a significant positive effect on yields after controlling for weather, irrigation, and chemical inputs. We find that the yields of winter wheat increase, on average, by 28% at high levels of landscape diversity, while corn and soy yields increase 7% and 5%, respectively. In addition, we find that increases in landscape diversity are significantly associated with reduced yield variability for winter wheat and corn, and that landscape diversity mitigates the effect of extreme weather conditions on yield. Study findings suggest that within a single, relatively low diversity state, increasing landscape diversity is positively associated with crop production resilience. Future extreme climate conditions may reduce crop yields and yield stability, requiring appropriate policies to ensure food security. Our findings suggest that landscape diversification may be an important tool within a portfolio of approaches to increase crop resilience under highly variable weather conditions.
