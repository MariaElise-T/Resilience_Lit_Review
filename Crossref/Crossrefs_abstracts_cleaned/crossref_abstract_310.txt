AbstractEarthquakes are among the natural hazards threatening the serviceafbility, functionality, and safety of engineering structures significantly. Posthazard structures may suffer from different damage states and correspondingly different functionality losses/recovery processes in the aftermath of hazardous events. This paper proposes a measure for structural time‐dependent seismic resilience considering multiple damage states. Its specific case (i.e., considering damage–no damage scenario) reduces to the existing resilience measure in the literature. The time‐variant fragility curves and the generalized seismic capacities are used to determine the damage states conditional on the peak ground motion (PGA). The proposed measure is applicable for both of the following two cases: (1) the earthquake occurrence rate and the magnitude of PGA conditional on earthquake occurrence are known; (2) the probability distribution of annual maximum PGA is known. In terms of the latter, the annual seismic hazard function can be used to describe the seismic load uncertainty. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed resilience measure. It is shown that the proposed measure can be used to quantitatively guide structural design to meet the target resilience level.
