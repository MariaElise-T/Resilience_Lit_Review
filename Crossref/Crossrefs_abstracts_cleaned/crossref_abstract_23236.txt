Climate-sensitive school buildings can enhance students’ learning performance and reduce the building’s overall energy consumption. This paper reports on a post-occupancy study of contemporary school buildings in Malaysia, assessing problems of solar heat gain. The research aims to propose retrofitting measures based on passive design principles adapted specifically for the Malaysian tropical climate to strengthen the resilience of local school buildings in a global climate emergency. On-site measurements in two different schools provided the empirical basis for the design modifications. The monitoring procedure included site observations, extended temperature and humidity measurements, and daylight analysis. A virtual classroom model was generated based on the on-site measurements, and a parametric simulation study was conducted to evaluate the proposed retrofit measures’ effectiveness. The model variables were evaluated and compared to identify the passive design elements that significantly impact heat gains and thermal comfort. The results showed that increasing roof overhangs to 1500 mm for additional shading, sensitive selection of roof materials and colours of white-painted zinc roof, and reduction of window-to-wall ratio by 30% to the operable windows helps to reduce solar gains by 6% to improve comfort conditions within the classrooms. Overall, the study provided evidence of how passive solar building design would benefit the climate resilience of Malaysian schools.
