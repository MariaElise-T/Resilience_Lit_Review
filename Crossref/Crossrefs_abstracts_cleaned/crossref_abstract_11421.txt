The present study examines levels of corruption and quality of life as predictors of national resilience among six samples of students from Australia, Germany, Britain, South Korea, Israel and Greece (N=1199). Results indicated that the level of corruption and quality of life index significantly predicted national resilience: the lower the level of corruption and the higher the level of quality of life, the higher the national resilience reported. Comparing the two predictors indicated that the level of corruption is a better predictor of national resilience compared with the quality of life index. This study points to the significant link between national resilience and corruption among low-level countries in the world's corruption hierarchy.
