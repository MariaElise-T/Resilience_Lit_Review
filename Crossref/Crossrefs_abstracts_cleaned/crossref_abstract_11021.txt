This paper adopts supply chain perspective to examine the impact of human capability in supply chain (SC) on SC resilience and business performance. Based on literature review, this paper expands understanding of factors, which contribute to SC resilience and competitive performance. The authors have operationalized elements of human capability in supply chain, SC collaboration, and SC responsive design to achieve this. Questionnaire was developed and was circulated to more than 600 organizations out of which 158 organizations responded and were useful. Hypotheses were formulated on studying the impact of these aspects on SC resilience and were tested using structural equation modelling. The study and the analysis support the hypothesis on the positive impact of supply chain human capability on SC collaboration and SC responsive design. Similarly, the hypothesis on SC collaboration and responsive design have tested positive impact on supply chain resilience which in turn has positive influence on organizations' performance that gives competitive edge.
