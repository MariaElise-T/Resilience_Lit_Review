The research was based on 211 participants from different training and research units. The level of study varies from Bachelor to Master. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire. The advantage of this instrument is that it is the most suitable way to collect large amounts of data. The results obtained reveal that exogenous factors (level of study, preservation of the image of the family and valuation of learners’ efforts at work by teachers) and endogenous (personal effort and commitment and development of capacities to be autonomous, to not be dependent on others) best explain the resilience to cheating among UFHB students.
