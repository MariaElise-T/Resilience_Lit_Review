Background:
Resilience is a characteristic and skill that nurses can learn. This study examined the current state and influencing factors of nurse resilience and nurse perceived job-related stressors.


Method:
This cross-sectional survey study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in China between May and August 2018. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to measure nurse resilience.


Results:

              A total of 2,981 nurses participated in the study, with an average resilience score of 61.35 ± 13.12. Nurse resilience was significantly correlated with age, years of employment, clinical rank, and education (
              p
              < .05). Main job-related stressors included frequent inspections and examinations, heavy workload, mandatory overtime, and low wages.
            


Conclusion:

              The participants had resilience scores that were lower than in the general public in the United States and China, as well as in nurses in developed countries. This study indicated a need for hospital leaders to find ways to reduce nurse work-related stress. Building nurse resilience should be an important focus for leaders.
