The assessment of the dynamic behaviour of resilient elements can be performed using the indirect method as described in the standard ISO 10846-3. This paper presents a methodology for control the error on the estimation of the frequency response functions (FRF) required for the application of the indirect method when sweep sine excitation is used. Based on a simulation process, this methodology allows for the design of the sweep sine excitation parameters, i.e., the sweep rate and the force amplitude, to control three types of errors associated to the experimentally obtained FRF in the presence of background noise: a general error of the FRF in a selected frequency range, and the errors associated to the amplitude and the frequency of the FRF resonance peak. The signal processing method used can be also tested with this methodology. The methodology has been tested in the characterisation of two different resilient elements: an elastomer and a coil spring. The simulated error estimations has been found to be in good agreement with the errors found in the measured FRF. Furthermore, it is found that for large signal-to-noise ratios, both sweep rate and force amplitude significantly affect the FRF estimation error, while, for small signal-to-noise ratios, only the force amplitude can control the error efficiently. The current methodology is specially interesting for laboratory test rigs highly used for the dynamic characterisation of resilient elements which are required to operate efficiently, since it can be used for minimising test times and providing quality assurance. Moreover, the application of this methodology would be specially relevant when characterisation is done in noisy environments.
