Organizations need to apply resilience and business continuity in industry to protect themselves against the crises and destructive events. Also, the growing expansion of competition in the global market and the increasing crisis in the world have increased the importance of optimal resource allocation. With the optimal resource allocation, huge losses and damages to organizations are prevented. The problem of resource allocation can be raised alongside the criteria of process resilience and continuity. Therefore, organizations change their perspective from focusing solely on reducing vulnerability to increasing resilience and continuity against to accidents in crises and destructive situations. The objective of this paper is proposed a mathematical model for optimal resource allocation with the aim of minimizing the lack of process resilience and maximizing the process continuity. So, the organization can continue to operate with available resources in times of crisis and lack of resources. Also, main activities and processes are not interrupted by crises and destructive events. After solving the model using a case study (textile industry), the results of the model were described and it was found that destructive events were recovered before the tolerance threshold and crisis and destructive events did not interrupt activities and processes.
