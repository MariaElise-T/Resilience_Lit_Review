Building a resilient future: Tackling climate change, human health and wildfires
MÃ³nica Rodrigues from the University of Coimbra and Fantina Tedim from the University of Porto, both in Portugal, present their perspectives on climate, human health, and wildfires to create a future that is both sustainable and resilient. Climate change is undoubtedly one of our highest social challenges, as it is arguably a risk multiplier for Europeans (Naumann et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021; Rodrigues, 2023; Tedim et al., 2023; Tedim et al., 2018), as it interacts with other contributing factors to increase human vulnerability. The report recently published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2022) stresses this interdependence between climate, ecosystems, and human societies. It also highlights the urgency in discussing the mechanisms underlying vulnerability, including human health and well-being, social justice, and demographics, to strengthen nationwide resilience and adaptation to climate change. Portugal was the first country to recognise a stable climate as a World Natural Heritage through the Climate Bill (Lei de Bases do Clima - Law No. 98/2021), approved by the Portuguese Parliament on 31st December 2021. This legal instrument establishes new provisions in public climate policies, consolidating goals, ruling principles, and obligations for climate action in the different levels of governance. The Climate Bill aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal.
