During a pandemic like COVID-19, the country adopted a lockdown to minizine the spread of the pandemic which disrupted the global supply chain and supply chain resilience failed to minimize disruption. In this regard, this study aims to explore the resilience system among countries during a global disruption and the impact of supply chain disruption on supply chain resilience through misinformation/fake news, panic buying behavior, and inflation factors. For this purpose, the analytical study has been selected to predict the impact of supply chain disruption on supply chain resilience through misinformation/fake news, panic buying behavior, and inflation and propose a solution accordingly. The data from 89 countries are collected on various factors for the year 2020 and mediating analysis is selected to test the hypothesis through regression and correlation. They illustrate that there is a 46% correlation and 21% dependency between supply chain disruption and supply chain resilience through misinformation/fake news, panic buying behavior, supply chain disruption & inflation. The criterion validity of convergence validity and Cronbach of homogeneity test are applied. It has been found that panic buying behavior & supply chain disruption has a 71% strong correlation as compared to other factors and the reliability is 69% which is highly reliable and acceptable. In the end, it is concluded that strong coordination among countries will minimize global supply chain disruption through supply chain resilience for continuing supply chain activities and supply chain organizations & mass media organizations coordination with each other for minimizing misinformation/fake news, panic buying behavior supply chain disruption, and inflation factors to improve supply chain resilience by using artificial intelligence technology.
