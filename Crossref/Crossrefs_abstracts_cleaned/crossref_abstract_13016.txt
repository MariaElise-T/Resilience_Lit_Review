Japanese public health nurses (PHNs) at public health centers (PHCs) have played critical roles in infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the actual pandemic-related experiences of PHNs and the relation between their experiences, individual resilience, two components of organizational resilience (system and human resilience), and burnout. An analysis of the responses of 351 PHNs revealed that mid-level PHNs scored higher in experience and lower in organizational resilience compared with those in other positions. More than 80% of respondents experienced inappropriate staff allocation. Multiple regression revealed that burnout was positively associated with the components of the experience of PHNs and negatively with individual and human resilience. In hierarchical multiple regression with depersonalization as the dependent variable, the sign of system resilience reversed from negative to positive when human resilience was added. The results highlight the need to prepare for future health crises including establishing a system with enough personnel, promoting human resilience such as collaboration among staff members, and burnout prevention measures, especially among mid-level PHNs. The study also described alternative approaches to comprehend system resilience—namely, a suppression variable of human resilience, promotion of depersonalization, and multicollinearity—and the need for further research on organizational resilience.
