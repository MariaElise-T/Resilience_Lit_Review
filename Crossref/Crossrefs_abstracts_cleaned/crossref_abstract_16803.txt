Understanding resilience and social support among individuals with substance use disorder on abstinence as well as relapse will helps promote long-term abstinence and enhance the recovery. Studies have shown that adequate social support and high level of resilience help an individual to use positive emotions to leave behind bad experience and strengthen one' s self-esteem and to overcome negative emotions and thus preventing relapse. As substance use disorder disrupts a person' s self-control and self-efficacy leading to relapse. It is important for the family members as well as health care professionals to provide social support that can increase the resilience and self-esteem and further decreasing the relapse rate. The study aims to compare the resilience and perceived social support among patients with substance use disorder in relapse and abstinence. Quantitative research approach with comparative research design was adopted. The population were the patients with relapse admitted at indoor, DAM and patients in abstinence with substance use disorder attending DAM, OPD of a tertiary care hospital. The sample consisted of 40 participants as per Krejcie and Morgan sample estimation formula who are selected by using purposive sampling technique. The data was collected by using socio demographic proforma, clinical variables, Conner and Davidson Resilience scale and Multidimensional perceived social support scale. The results showed no significant difference between the two groups i.e Relapse and abstinence in the context of Perceived Social support and Resilience respectively (t=-1.611, p=0.115) (t=-0.309, p=0.759). This study may be a suggestive of developing psychosocial intervention module to promote social support and resilience and to decreases the risk of relapse.
