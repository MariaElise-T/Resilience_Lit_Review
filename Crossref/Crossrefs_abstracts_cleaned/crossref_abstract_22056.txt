Purpose: The purpose of this study is to find out whether job stress and psychological burnout of early childhood special teachers affect happiness, and to suggest a direction for enhancing teachers' happiness by identifying variables that affect happiness through resilience. Method: A questionnaire survey was conducted on job stress, psychological burnout, resilience, and happiness among 97 early childhood special education teachers at 11 specialized childcare centers for the disabled in Gwangju and Jeonnam. Appropriate procedures for research ethics were passed through institutional IRB approval, and data were analyzed through multivariate analysis, correlation analysis, and structural equation model analysis. Results: First, the higher the job stress, the higher the psychological burnout and the lower the resilience of the early childhood special teachers. She also found that the higher the psychological burnout, the lower the resilience, and the higher the resilience, the higher the happiness. Second, as a result of the structural equation model analysis of early childhood special teachers, the higher the psychological burnout, the lower the resilience. In addition, as psychological burnout increases, resilience decreases, and resilience has a mediating effect in the relationship between psychologicalburnout and happiness. Conclusion: The fact that resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between psychological burnout and happiness in early childhood special teachers suggests that measures to improve resilience and program support are needed to prevent psychological burnout exhaustion in early childhood special teachers.
