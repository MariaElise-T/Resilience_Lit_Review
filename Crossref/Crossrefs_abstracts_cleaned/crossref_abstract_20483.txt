 Resilience, or the capacity to be able to develop oneself successfully despite adverse circumstances, has become a concept of interest in recent years. There is a clear relationship between resilience, psychological well-being, and coping strategies. This study looked at 890 subjects with a mean age of 46.77 ( SD = 20.86) years, ranging from 18 and 95 years old. The participants were 40.6% men and 59.4% women. Using this sample, three clusters were developed by MATLAB R2010a and the Self-Organizing Maps toolbox. Two of these had high resilience, and the other one had low resilience; the psychological well-being variables and coping strategies were taken into account. Thereafter, multivariate analysis of variance showed a group effect for the resilience, psychological well-being, and coping strategies variables. Establishing resilient profiles based on variables such as psychological well-being and coping strategies reveals the best features for coping with stressful situations; this could help to promote nonpharmacological therapies for increasing resilience.
