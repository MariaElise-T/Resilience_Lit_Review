Abstract
Climate extremes that continuously bring unpredictable weather patterns particularly strong typhoons and rainfall events devastated many coconut-producing areas in the Philippines. These weather patterns affected the livelihood of farmers and the whole supply chain of the coconut industry. Adoption of a clustering system of farmers is a key approach to sustaining the growing needs of the coconut industry. This will ensure the continuous engagement of farmers in coconut farming where good agricultural practices are performed in developing products that meet the domestic and international market standards. However, clustering of climate-resilient integrated farming systems through participation in multi-purpose cooperatives requires scientific guidance, market-driven production and market linkages.
This paper integrates learnings from past coconut and coconut-based farming system (CBFS) projects. Further, it highlights the learning-by-doing approach where core trainers are developed to train farmer groups in designing location-specific climate-resilient CBFS using a hybrid curriculum of CR – Farmers Field School (CR – FFS) and Farmer Business School. This improvement in the integrated curriculum can change individual and community perspectives, improve farm practices, reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards and risks, provide sustainable livelihoods and enhance farmers’ participation in agri-enterprises. The CR-CBFS season-long training exercises will integrate climate risks and forecasts in farmers’ decision-making, provide technical and business lenses for improved farm productivity and profitability through the integration of complementary enterprises such as intercropping, livestock, value-adding and processing that consider environmental, socio-cultural and economic factors.
