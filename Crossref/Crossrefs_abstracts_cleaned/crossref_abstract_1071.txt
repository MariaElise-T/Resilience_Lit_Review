Abstract
Recent theoretical studies, based on vortex Rossby wave (VRW) dynamics, have established the importance of the radial structure of the primary circulation in the response of tropical cyclone (TC)–like vortices to ambient vertical wind shear. Linear VRW theory suggests, in particular, that the degree of broadness of the primary circulation in the near-core region beyond the radius of maximum wind strongly influences whether a tilted TC vortex will realign and resist vertical shear or tilt over and shear apart. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations have verified that the vortex resiliency is indeed sensitive to the initial radial structure of the idealized vortex. This raises the question of how well the “true” nature of a TC’s primary circulation is represented by idealized vortices that are commonly used in some theoretical studies.
In this paper the swirling wind structure of TCs is reexamined by utilizing flight-level observations collected from Atlantic and eastern Pacific storms during 1977–2001. Hundreds of radial profiles of azimuthal-mean tangential wind and relative vorticity are constructed from over 5000 radial flight leg segments and compared with some standard idealized vortex profiles. This analysis reaffirms that real TC structure in the near-core region is characterized by relatively slow tangential wind decay in conjunction with a skirt of significant cyclonic relative vorticity possessing a negative radial gradient. This broadness of the primary circulation is conspicuously absent in some idealized vortices used in theoretical studies of TC evolution in vertical shear. The relationship of the current findings to the problem of TC resiliency is discussed.
