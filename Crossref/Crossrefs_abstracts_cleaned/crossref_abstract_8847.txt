Infrastructure systems, such as bridges, are perpetually vulnerable to natural hazards such as seismic events, flooding, and landslides. This study aims to determine the relevant parameters required to increase the seismic resilience of bridge infrastructure based on the decisions of experts and prior research. To this end, the crisp DEMATEL (decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory) and rough DEMATEL methods are employed. Rough DEMATEL is a supplement to crisp DEMATEL that incorporates rough theory to handle ambiguity. The efficacies of the rough and crisp DEMATEL methods are then compared between the two approaches. This study found the most crucial seismic-resilience variables for bridges. The outcomes of this study reveal the significant order and cause-and-effect relationships. This research can assist transportation engineers and executive agencies in enhancing the seismic resilience of roadway bridges and bridge networks.
