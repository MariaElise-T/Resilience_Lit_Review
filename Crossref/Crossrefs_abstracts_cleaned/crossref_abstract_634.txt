This study, entitled Teachers’ resiliency and the schools readiness to distance education in this time of COVID-19 was conducted to public elementary school institutions, particularly the 2 clusters of Malita North district in Malita, Davao Occidental for the School Year 2020-2021. Descriptive-correlational research design was employed. Adopted survey questionnaire known as Personal Resiliency Scale (PRS) was utilized to measure the resiliency level of the teacher-respondent while an adapted instrument on the schools’ readiness to distance education as perceived by the school teachers was used. Slovin’s formula was employed to determine the sample size of 268 and stratified random sampling technique was applied to ensure proportional distribution of respondents. According to primary school teachers, schools are wonderfully prepared for distance education. The readiness of schools to implement distant education is strongly linked to teacher resiliency. Purposefulness, Social Support, and Adaptability are the three constructs in question. As the degree of these constructs rises, so will the readiness to participate in distance education.Teachers’ resiliency, particularly the concept-Purposefulness, has a substantial impact on school readiness, meaning that we may anticipate school readiness by looking at the level of this construct. The r2=0.350 value indicates that 35.00 percent of the data under consideration fits the regression model. As a result, additional elements that contributed to schools’ preparation for distant education were not taken into account in this study. According to the findings, 35.00 percent of the data examined fit the regression model. As a result, it is suggested that other factors that may have contributed to schools’ preparation for distant education be investigated.
