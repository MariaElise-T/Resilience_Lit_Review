This study sought to investigate the mediating role of resilience between career adaptability and life satisfaction among Turkish university students, drawing on the LD approach. A total of 287 university students, 226 (78.7%) of whom were female and 61 (21.3%) were male, participated in the study. Participants' ages varied, from 19 to 37, with a mean of 21.23 (SD = 2.36). The mediating role of resilience in the relationship between career adaptability and life satisfaction was tested using structural equation modelling. In this study, it was found that resilience has a partial mediating role in the relationship between career adaptability and life satisfaction. This finding shows that career adaptability positively predicts life satisfaction both directly and indirectly via resilience in university students. The results indicated that it is easier for university students with high career adaptability to adapt to adverse conditions and recover themselves. Thus, these university students may evaluate their lives as more satisfactory. Both theoretical and practical consequences of the study's findings are given.
