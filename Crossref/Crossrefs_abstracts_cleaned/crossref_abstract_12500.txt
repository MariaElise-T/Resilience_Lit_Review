Assessment and planning of crisis management with the approach to natural flood disasters include many factors. In this regard, one of the basic principles of crisis management is based on the resilience of urban infrastructure against floods. This study developed strategies to increase resilience by flood zoning and crisis management. The investigation of the current situation shows that despite the efforts being made, the climatic and environmental conditions of the rivers, the settlements of the infiltration basin, the constructions, and the location inaccuracy of the following structures indicate many challenges in managing the current situation in various components of crisis management. In this regard, the main direction of this article is to evaluate the urban resilience of the Khuzestan region against floods based on a crisis management approach and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Fuzzy weighting methods using geographic information system (GIS).
