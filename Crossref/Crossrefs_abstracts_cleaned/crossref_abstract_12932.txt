The study determined rice farmers’ perceived resilience capacity to climate change in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling procedure was employed in selecting 104 respondents for the study. Data were collected using semi-structured interview schedule. Percentage, mean and standard deviation were used in presentation of results. Results showed that areas of rice farmers’ resilience capacity to climate change were: planting improved varieties of seed ( x̄ =4.76), utilisation of soil that retains water longer ( x̄ =3.33), access to very fertile soil for rice production ( x̄ =3.28) and good amount of solar radiation ( x̄ =3.21). However, areas in which respondents’ did not perceive as sources of resilience capacity were: favourable government policies ( x̄ =2.37), good marketing policies ( x̄ =2.57), and access to insurance ( x̄ =2.84). Policies such as crop insurance, appropriate marketing and infrastructural policies that help rice farmers cope with negative effects of climate change be enacted and implemented. Such policies should address issues of marketing and insurance of rice farms against disasters such as flood, drought, diseases and pests’ infestation.
