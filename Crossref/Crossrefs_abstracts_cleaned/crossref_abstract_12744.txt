Abstract
Background
Resilience has emerged as a concept that could explain and predict good academic and well-being of students in stressful and traumatic situations. This study was conducted to assess resilience and identify predictors of high or low resilience scores among future nurses in Palestine.

Methods
This cross-sectional study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement. Undergraduate nursing students in all academic years were recruited and asked to complete a questionnaire that contained the Trait Resilience Scale and the State-Resilience Scale. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify predictors of higher resilience scores and to control for potentially confounding factors.

Results
In this study, 290 students completed the questionnaire (response rate = 92.4%). The means of trait, state, and combined resilience scores were 71.4 (SD: 7.5), 62.7 (SD: 6.7), and 134.1 (SD: 12.8), respectively. There was a significant moderate positive correlation between state resilience scores and trait resilience scores (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Having a study routine on daily basis predicted higher trait (β = -0.20, p < 0.001), state (β = -0.12, p = 0.032), and combined (β = -0.18, p = 0.001) resilience scores. Trait and combined resilience scores were predicted by the absence of chronic diseases (β = 0.12, p < 0.05), experiencing addiction issues (β = -0.11, p < 0.05), living in Israeli seized areas (β = 0.16, p < 0.05), and living in a house with enough number of rooms per siblings (β = 0.13, p < 0.05). On the other hand, state and combined resilience scores were predicted by being in the first academic year (β = -0.18, p < 0.01), and state resilience scores were predicted by living in urban areas (β = -0.12, p < 0.05).

Conclusions
Undergraduate nursing students in Palestine reported relatively high trait and state resilience scores. Higher trait, state, and combined resilience scores were predicted by having a study routine on daily basis. More studies are still needed to investigate the relationship between resilience scores, perceived well-being, willingness to care, and the future success of nursing students in Palestine.
