Abstract. Community resilience has become an important policy and research concept for
understanding and addressing the challenges associated with the interplay of
climate change, urbanization, population growth, land use, sustainability,
vulnerability and increased frequency of extreme flooding. Although
measuring resilience has been identified as a fundamental step toward its
understanding and effective management, there is, however, lack of an
operational measurement framework due to the difficulty of systematically
integrating socioeconomic and techno-ecological factors. The study examines
the challenges, constraints and construct ramifications that have
complicated the development of an operational framework for measuring
resilience of flood-prone communities. Among others, the study highlights
the issues of proliferation of definitions and conceptual frameworks of
resilience, challenges of data availability, data variability and data
compatibility. Adopting the NationalÂ Academies' definition of resilience, a
conceptual and mathematical model was developed using the dimensions,
quantities and relationships established by the definition. A fuzzy logic
equivalent of the model was implemented to generate resilience indices for
three flood-prone communities in the United States. The results indicate that the
proposed framework offers a viable approach for measuring community flood
resilience, even when there is a limitation on data availability and
compatibility.
