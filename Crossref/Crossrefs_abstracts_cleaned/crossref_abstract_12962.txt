AbstractIn this paper we concentrate on issues relating to the planning and design of ring transport networks with stringent resilience requirements. Given the standardized and widely used ring protection schemes as well as the Single Ring Interconnection (SRI) and the Dual Node Interworking (DNI) schemes, we engage in a study to examine the issues and trade‐offs arising from the variety of architecture options when planning a network. We analyze and compare the resilience properties of the various options including the recently defined and developed DNI on protection interworking feature. We then use a case study to demonstrate the traffic carrying capabilities and the resilience properties of the various available architectures under different traffic scenarios. Trade‐offs introduced are illustrated and explained and an analysis of the modeling results allows for a better understanding of the significance of ring clustering for resilience purposes. We conclude on the penalties of DNI when MS‐SPRings and SNCP‐ring architectures are employed and we demonstrate that significant efficiencies can be achieved from the emergence of DNI on protection techniques.
