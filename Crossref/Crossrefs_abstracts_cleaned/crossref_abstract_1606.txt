Abstract
Acute stress before slaughter has been demonstrated to have a detrimental impact on pork quality, but little is known about whether early life stress has a similar effect. Our objective was to identify if stress resiliency or vulnerability at weaning had an impact on long-term performance resulting in differences in growth, carcass, or meat quality traits. At weaning, blood samples were collected from all gilt piglets from 26 crossbred litters (n = 170) at -1 d, 0 d, and +4 d pre- and post-weaning. For each litter, serum cortisol was used to identify the gilt most capable of returning to baseline levels by +4 d as stress resilient (SR, n = 26) and the gilt least capable as stress vulnerable (SV, n = 26). The SR and SV gilts were processed at the Michigan State University Meat Laboratory and carcass and meat quality data were collected. Carcass traits included finished live weight, hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, loin muscle area, and 10th-rib backfat depth. Meat quality traits included 45-min and ultimate pH, marbling score, subjective color score, Minolta colorimeter L*, a* and b*, and drip loss. Data were analyzed using Gaussian linear models. The base model included stress group and farrowing group as fixed effects and age at slaughter as a covariate. The SR gilts showed decreased ADG at the grow-finish stage resulting in lighter finished weight (P = 0.089 and P = 0.070, respectively). The SR gilts also had a lighter hot carcass weight (P = 0.05); however, no differences were observed in dressing percentage ( P= 0.924). the SR and SV gilts did not differ in backfat depth, but SR gilts had smaller loin muscle area (P = 0.019). No differences were observed in any of the meat quality measures. In summary, we found resiliency to weaning stress to have a minimal impact on carcass merit or meat quality. Future studies will aim to determine if the observed difference in loin muscle area is associated with gene expression differences.
