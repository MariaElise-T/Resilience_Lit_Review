Abstract
This study investigates the resilience of kampung settlement based on connectivity for developing mitigation strategy in urban context. Kampung Taman Sari, Bandung, is chosen as a case study of this paper. Kampung, the main urban settlement type of every city in Indonesia, is an informal settlement, with minimum urban services and facilities, therefore inhabitants who living there are more vulnerable in the response of disaster evacuation. This paper studies a deep understanding of the morphological configuration of Kampung based on connectivity and networks which define and show the degree of capability to prepare, respond, recover, and survive in the face of disaster. Depth map simulation and Space Syntax is used to analyze the degree of connectivity and network. The result shows the key relation of connectivity and accessibility of movement evacuation, not only for human movement but also rescue team, including the transportation.
