Although the need to protect and draw upon the various benefits of heritage as an asset for resilience is nowadays more clearly highlighted than in the past, policies to protect heritage from disaster risk remain fragmented, while the importance of learning from heritage and existing knowledge for building resilience is underestimated. The aim of this study is to provide an insight on good practices dealing with cultural heritage when it comes to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation, aiming at increasing cultural heritage resilience of historical areas. To this aim, the paper applies the best practice research methodology for investigating cultural heritage resilience in historical areas through the codification and analysis of good practices collected from EU-funded projects. The results consist of more than 90 good practices reviewed and analyzed according to a set of criteria. The research findings, organized according to three main categories (i.e., institutional, structural/physical, social), contribute to emphasizing the importance of improving knowledge from already available good practices. Two main approaches have been highlighted in the discussion, according to the key role assigned to stakeholders, education, data, and technology. The results allow to take advantage of existing knowledge to support communities to increase resilience of cultural heritage in historical areas.
