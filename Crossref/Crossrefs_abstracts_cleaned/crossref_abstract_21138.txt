The aim of this study is to identify the effect of supply chain resilience as measured by supply chain flexibility, supply chain collaboration, and supply chain agility on supply chain performance. A sample consisting of employees from chemical industrial companies in Jordan was selected to collect data using an electronic questionnaire. Analyzing data via SmartPLS 3.0, the results showed that supply chain collaboration and supply chain agility as key dimensions of supply chain resilience had significant effects on supply chain performance, while supply chain flexibility exerted insignificant effect on supply chain performance. Therefore, managers are recommended to improve their firms’ abilities to carry out effective work with partners and to enhance firms’ abilities to respond quickly to unpredictable changes. Scholars are also requested to conduct further studies such as investigating the effect of supply chain redundancy on supply chain performance.
