AbstractThis paper studies the resilience‐based output containment control problem of heterogeneous multi‐agent systems in the presence of simultaneous false data injection attacks on both sensors and actuators injected on both cyber and physical layers. In real‐world security problems, malicious adversaries could inject false data injection attacks on both sensors and actuators simultaneously, even with unbounded injections, to maximize their damage to the multi‐agent systems. To address such a problem, a distributed observer is first designed for each follower to estimate the actual system states against unbounded sensor attacks. A resilience‐based control framework is then proposed using state estimation and adaptive control techniques to compensate for the bounded actuator attack signals adaptively. Lyapunov stability analysis shows that uniformly ultimately bounded convergence is achieved despite the simultaneously injected unbounded sensor attacks and bounded actuator attacks on both cyber and physical layers. That is, each follower's output trajectory converges to a small neighbourhood around the convex hull spanned by the leaders' output trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results is verified by case studies using numerical simulations.
