Abstract
Background
Information on understanding the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and positive and negative stress among students is limited. The objective of this research was to evaluate the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between positive and negative stress and PTG in university students.

Methods
The research was carried out using an associative strategy with an empirical approach and explanatory design, with a sample of 507 participants whose average age was 22.38 years ($${\text{S}\text{D}}_{\text{a}\text{g}\text{e}}$$= 3.758), the sample was mostly composed of women (70.4%).

Results
The results allow us to describe that resilience plays a complete mediating role in the relationship between negative stress and PTG. On the other hand, mediation was partial when resilience mediated the relationship between positive stress and PTG. In addition, multigroup invariance analyses according to gender and geographic context show that there is no difference in males, females, and the region where they reside.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the hypothesis that resilience fulfills the mediating function is ratified.
