AbstractEffective education and evaluation may be achieved when the mental and emotional health of the students being evaluated are taken into consideration. As a consequence of this, the purpose of this research was to try to highlight the dynamic that exists between Test Anxiety (TA), Academic Emotion Regulation (AER), L2 grit (L2G), academic resilience (AR), and core of self-assessment (CAS). In order to accomplish this goal, 417 English as a foreign language (EFL) students from Kuwait were provided with copies of the Test Anxiety Scale, the Academic Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, the Language-domain-specific Grit Scale, the Academic Resilience Scale, and the Core of Selfâ€‘Assessment Questionnaire. The screening of the data using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) explicitly determined the impacts AER, L2G, AR, and CAS had on TA. It means that students who has developed a healthy state of AER, L2G, AR, and CSA could modulate their Test Anxiety skillfully. The implications of the study, which might lead to enhancements in language instruction and evaluation, are discussed in detail.
