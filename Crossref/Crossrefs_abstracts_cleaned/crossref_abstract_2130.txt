In this paper, we introduce the social dimension of the term resilience which
   is different than all the other theoretical disciplines that use this term.
   The connection between the concept of resilience and the theory of social
   systems is viewed from a critical standpoint, and also with different
   ontological perspectives in regard to understanding resilience. The
   resilience as it exists in ecological or socio - ecological theories in
   social reality is more complex when considering social relations and changes
   that have different effects on functionality, adaptability and
   transformational capacities of society and its units. In regard to that, the
   constructivist approach offers an analytical framework that includes two
   tasks. On the one hand, the discovery of the interpretative meaning of social
   resilience as a concept, and on the other hand, using the normative neutral
   approach as a way of dealing with various social situations that are burdened
   with risks, troubles, but also with possibilities.
