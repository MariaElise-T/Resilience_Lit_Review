Introduction: This paper draws on a study and its findings that set out to explore why some students appear to thrive, turning placement experiences into positive empowering opportunities despite the challenges, where others may not. Findings established a broader application beyond placements to inform curriculum design and delivery that nurtures professionalism, competence and identity from pre-admission to transition into practice as a journey of growth and development. Method: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Questionnaires and interviews gathered data from two cohorts in traditional ( n = 25) or role-emerging placements ( n = 13). An interpretive approach was employed for the qualitative data. The quantitative data underwent statistical analysis. Findings: Students in role-emerging placements scored higher in resilience prior to and developed greater resilience as a consequence. These students scored higher in traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness and were more emotionally stable compared with students in traditional placements. Agreeableness was positively correlated with greater resilience in these students. Conclusion: Curricula design and delivery should embed opportunities throughout programmes of study enabling students to nurture an openness to new experiences, with positive risk taking, building an ability to thrive. Understanding individual differences in students informs the development of competence and identity pivotal for transition into practice.
