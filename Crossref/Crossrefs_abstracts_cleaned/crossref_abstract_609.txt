Abstract

AIM
The purpose of this study was to explore resilience among nursing faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine associations or differences that may exist among variables and between groups.


BACKGROUND
Nurse educators’ resilience has been identified as an important characteristic because of the challenges involved in nursing education. It is important to explore resilience among nurse educators to determine which factors promote or inhibit this important characteristic.


METHOD
This correlational research study used an online survey to explore factors related to resilience among nurse faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlational analyses were used to determine the relationship between various resilience constructs and select demographic variables.


RESULTS
Findings indicated that higher levels of resilience were associated with age (ρ = .21, p < .001), experience teaching online (r = .22, p < .001), and professional development related to online teaching (M = 80.7, SD = 11.0), t(276) = 2.41, p = .017.


CONCLUSION
Resilience and related characteristics have the potential to assist nurse educators in adapting successfully to stressful circumstances. It is crucial that schools of nursing develop programs to enhance or develop resilience among nurse educators. Support and training in the area of online education are also of paramount importance.
