With the victory in poverty alleviation, China’s “Three Rural Issues” effort is shifting its attention to the execution of the rural revitalization strategy. To consolidate the poverty eradication gains and boost the resilience of the livelihoods of people who have been lifted out of poverty, we must implement several different strategies. Improving the livelihood resilience of the poverty-stricken population is the main objective of the long-term mechanism of promoting rural revitalization. Based on the theory of sustainable livelihoods, this paper creates an analysis framework for livelihood resilience of the poverty-stricken population. On this basis, we use principal component regression to measure the livelihood resilience of poverty-stricken population in Chongqing M Reservoir Area. We use the seemingly unrelated regression model to identify important variables influencing the stability of farm households emerging from poverty and propose policy to optimize resilience of the livelihoods of people lifted out of poverty. The results show that the population living in poverty around the Chongqing M Reservoir has a steadily rising livelihood resilience index. Among them, policy support has a significant positive effect on the livelihood resilience of poverty-stricken population. Similarly, regional endowments have a significant positive effect on the livelihood resilience of poverty-stricken population. However, livelihood risk has a significant negative effect on the livelihood resilience of poverty-stricken population. These findings provide a basis for the subsequent enhancement of livelihood resilience.
