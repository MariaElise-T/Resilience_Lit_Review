This research paper examines the International Political Economy (IPE) to explore how the adoption of systems thinking can foster resilient governance in an increasingly fragmented global landscape. It juxtaposes the linear philosophy predominant in Western thought with the nonlinear essence ingrained in Eastern philosophy, linking these paradigms to the qualitative and quantitative approaches that shape IPE. Through a comparative analysis of instruments for growth, linear-nonlinear feedback loops, and the interplay between trade policy and international relations dynamics, the paper argues for the convergence of top-down and bottom-up strategies in policymaking. By integrating these diverse perspectives, the argument endeavours to highlight the importance of reconciling disparate approaches to enhance the adaptability and efÔÄÅcacy of governance systems in a complex world.
