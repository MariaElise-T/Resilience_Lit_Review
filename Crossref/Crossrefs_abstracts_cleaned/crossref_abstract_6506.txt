AbstractThe need for sustainable and resilient long‐term strategies for coastal restoration and development projects is largely the result of pressures brought by changing climate conditions and growing human populations along coastal boundaries. As anthropogenic impacts along our coasts increase, the demand for sustainable, nature‐based solutions (NbS) will grow commensurately. Trusted approaches are needed for successful implementation of NbS, especially in regions hardest hit by environmental changes. Nearshore strategies for new construction and protection of existing coastal infrastructure are shifting rapidly from hardened approaches to more ecologically aligned techniques that work with natural forces and enhance natural habitat. This paper highlights the benefits of living shorelines composed of ecotypic native plants, wave attenuation structures for coastal protection, and managed retreat to restore coastal environments while supporting and maintaining natural habitats. We review several NbS and present two case studies to illustrate the value of incorporating nature‐based approaches to vulnerable coastal environments and highlight the importance of maximizing synergies and understanding trade‐offs in their long‐term use.
