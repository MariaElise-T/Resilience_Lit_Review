The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship among general self-efficacy, resilience, life satisfaction and the extent to which the variables of resilience and life satisfaction contribute to the prediction of general self-efficacy. The study was carried out with 310 middle-aged adults in Burdur, 195 (62.9%) of which were female, 115 (37.1&) were male, 70 (22.6%) were single, 227 (73.2%) were married and 13 (4.2%) were divorced. The General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Resilience in Midlife Scale (RIM-S) and the Life Satisfaction Scale were used in the study. Correlation coefficient of pearson moments and hierarchical regression analysis were used in the analysis of the data. As a consequence, it was determined that there is a positive relationship among general self-efficacy, resilience and life satisfaction. Also, it was observed that the variables of resilience and life satisfaction significantly predict general self-efficacy.Keywords: General self-efficacy, resilience, life satisfaction
