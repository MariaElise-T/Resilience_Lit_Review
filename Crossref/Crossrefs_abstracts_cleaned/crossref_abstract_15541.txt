 LGBTQ+ asylum seekers face persecution and discrimination leading to escape from their home countries to places where LGBTQ+ identity and HIV status are grounds for asylum. Although researchers have documented this populationâ€™s experiences of pre-, during, and postmigration trauma, there remains a gap in exploring factors that contribute to posttraumatic growth (PTG) and resilience. Researchers in this study used a phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of PTG and resilience of participants living in the United States, but originally from seven different countries. Four main themes were identified: survival mechanisms of pre-migration trauma, external resources and supports, PTG skills, and complex characteristics of resilience. Implications for counseling research and clinical practice are discussed.
