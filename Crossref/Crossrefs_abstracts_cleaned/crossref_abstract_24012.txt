 9069  Background: Most patients with extensive SCLC develop drug resistance to platinum-based 1L therapy or discontinue for other reasons, and second-line (2L) therapies are limited. RESILIENT (NCT03088813) is a two-part phase 2/3 study assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 2L liposomal irinotecan monotherapy in adults with SCLC who progressed with platinum-based 1L therapy. Preliminary data from RESILIENT part 1 (cut-off May 8 2019; ≥ 12 weeks follow-up) showed that liposomal irinotecan 70 mg/m2 free base every 2 weeks was generally well tolerated and had encouraging antitumor activity (Paz-Ares et al. WCLC 2019 OA03.03). Objective response rate (ORR; secondary endpoint) was 44% (11/25). Here we report efficacy analyses in post hoc subgroups by platinum sensitivity. Methods: RESILIENT part 1 was an open-label, single-arm study comprising dose-finding and dose-expansion phases. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 y, with an ECOG performance status score of 0/1 and adequate organ function; a single line of prior immunotherapy was allowed. Participants received liposomal irinotecan 70 mg/m2 or 85 mg/m2 free base every 2 weeks, with tumor assessments every 6 weeks (RECIST v1.1). Analyses were undertaken for the dose-finding phase recommended dose (RD) in subgroups of platinum-resistant/sensitive patients (with/without progression within 90 days from completion of 1L therapy). Results: During dose finding, 5 patients received liposomal irinotecan 85 mg/m2 (deemed not tolerable; dose-limiting toxicity) and 12 received 70 mg/m2 (deemed tolerable; RD for dose-expansion phase in which 13 more patients were included). Analyses included all 25 patients receiving the RD (mean exposure, 13.95 weeks [median 14.86; SD 7.222]). In the platinum-sensitive subgroup (33.3% men; median age 62.0 y) ORR was 53.3% (8/15) and 12-week disease control rate (DCR12wks) was 60% (9/15); in the platinum-resistant subgroup (50% men, median age 58.0 y) both ORR and DCR12wks were 30% (3/10). Overall and progression-free survival (secondary endpoints) are not yet mature. Conclusions: ORR and DCR12wks were numerically higher in platinum-sensitive than in platinum-resistant patients with SCLC who had progressed with platinum-based 1L therapy before receiving 2L liposomal irinotecan 70 mg/m2 in this phase 2 study. RESILIENT part 2, an ongoing, phase 3, randomized controlled trial vs topotecan, will provide further data. Clinical trial information: NCT03088813.
