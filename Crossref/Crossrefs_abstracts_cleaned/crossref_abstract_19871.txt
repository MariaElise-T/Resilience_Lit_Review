Developing community capital is widely viewed as a way to address community resilience-related issues toward sustainability. Based on a Taiwanese, peri-urban, Hakka settlement, this article presents findings on the practical factors in the development of community capital via farm-to-table and community care, and their implications for a resilient, healthy community. It shows that community capital arising from the pond farming, pond education, and community service systems can interact to support its diversity and linkability. The pond-based social network is identified as the key to mitigating the impacts of community challenges regarding food safety concerns, environmental degradation, and aging population. It argues that the pond-based food landscape, communal network, and a borderless campus can enhance community capital as well as play significant parts in achieving community sustainability by promoting residentsâ€™ health and well-being.
