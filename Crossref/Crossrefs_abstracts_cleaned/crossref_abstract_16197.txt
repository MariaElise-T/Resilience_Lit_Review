Resilience is one of the protective factors for mental health. The aim of this study is to reveal the role of COVID‐19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty in predicting resilience in adulthood. To this end, data were collected from 533 adults (359 women‐174 men). A hierarchical regression analysis was performed, controlling for the effects of gender and presence of a chronic disease on the prediction of resilience. Results showed that intolerance of uncertainty and COVID‐19 anxiety were statistically significant predictors of resilience. Gender and presence of a chronic disease were not statistically significant in predicting resilience. These results indicate that intolerance of uncertainty plays an important role in explaining resilience.
