The challenging and threatening circumstances give human life a boost or energy to use human brain for imagination. Human brain is gifted or blessed with power of imagination to dive deep into everything that comes to him in the destructive form. Perhaps it must be an evil omen that
 the entire world is passing through the stage of world's most ever witnessed painful suffering that is Covid-19. Natural calamities such as earthquake, flood, drought etc. have tremendously given a jolt to human peace, comfort and life itself on one hand and suffering and horrors caused by
 Genocides, War, Holocausts, Epidemics, Plague and measureless experiences of sexual exploitation like rape and torture on the other hand. But human being always hopes for better prospect though he or his ancestors are an eyewitness to all these life- threatening occurrences. One reason of
 his overcoming all these sufferings and horrors beyond his worst dreams is that he that is human being has proved his admirable power of human resilience that make him strong enough to adapt to the situation to overcome it with fortitude and hits back to the situation. It is well said that
 the pain you feel today is the strength you feel tomorrow. For every challenge encountered, there is an opportunity for growth. The resilience of human being has been accepting challenges in its various forms since time immemorial. It helps him to withstand such horrendous attacks as war,
 emotional and physical violation, brutality, deprivation, acute poverty, disasters and even life-threatening illness.
