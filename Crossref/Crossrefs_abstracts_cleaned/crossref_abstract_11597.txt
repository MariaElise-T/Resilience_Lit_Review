Multi-agent systems is an evolving discipline that encompasses many different branches of research. The long-standing Agents at Aberdeen ( A 3 ) group undertakes research across several areas of multi-agent systems, focusing in particular on aspects related to resilience, reliability, and coordination. In this article we introduce the group and highlight past research successes in those themes, building a picture of the strengths within the group. We close the paper outlining the future direction of the group and identify key open challenges and our vision towards solving them.
