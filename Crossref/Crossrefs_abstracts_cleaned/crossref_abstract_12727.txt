AbstractResilience is a widely studied concept that is a key objective in the design and development of sustainable systems. This is especially true for the agricultural systems critical to food production, economic viability, and sustainability of our communities, as farmers seek to meet increasing demand in the face of shocks such as climate change and natural disasters. Although there is a rich body of work examining resilience, there is limited understanding of how the concept of resilience should be tailored for agricultural systems. This study seeks to address this gap by performing a systematic literature review of 50 papers selected from SCOPUS using the PRISMA protocol. A summary of research topics and characteristics by geographical region is presented. The paper also categorizes the types of shocks studied and the corresponding response methods. Results suggest that the focus of resilience research changes by region, which may indicate that design strategies and objectives should also differ by region. Furthermore, the work identifies a need for more simulation-based quantitative research into the impact of resilience.
