 It is widely known that sexual assault disproportionately affects women, and college-aged women are particularly at risk. Sexual assault can occur at any age and may have a varying range of emotional consequences for survivors, including pathological coping mechanisms such as disordered eating behaviors. This study examined the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and disordered eating behavior in a sample of women who reported experiencing sexual assault in adulthood. The sample included 312 undergraduate women who identified as majority White (81.4%) and heterosexual (77.9%). Participants completed measures assessing history of sexual experiences, PTSD symptoms, disordered eating behavior, and resilience. Only those who reported experiences of sexual victimization since age 14+ were included in analyses. Results confirmed the hypothesis, as resilience significantly mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms and disordered eating behavior in a sample of women with a history of sexual victimization. These results highlight the importance of resilience as a mitigating factor in recovery from sexual trauma. Other research indicates that resilience may have emotion-regulatory benefits that mitigate the development of disordered eating behavior. However, the specific functionality of resilience as a protective factor after sexual victimization is unclear. Further research should focus on ways to foster resilience in a clinical setting for those with a history of sexual victimization. Limitations of this study include underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities, as well as use of entirely self-report measures.
