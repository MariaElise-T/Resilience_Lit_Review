ABSTRACTLinked socioecological systems consist of economies in societies in nature and make explicit the relationship between the natural environment and human well‐being using the language of ecosystem services. A growth‐based economy within a constrained biophysical planet (e.g., human activities) has led to a need for ecosystem resilience. Valuation of ecosystem services using the language of economics appears insufficient in the face of human activity. All ecosystems are resilient but will demonstrate that resilience in unexpected and potentially unwanted ways, particularly as human pressures and influences lead to tipping points of extinction (e.g., complete die‐off of coral reefs) in these linked socioecological systems. Structured approaches for evaluating the risks, benefits, and impacts of human activities exist but are not effectively applied and when applied, focus on downstream outcomes rather than on upstream actions (e.g., responding to climate change impacts rather than addressing causes of climate change). Ecosystem resilience in the face of unprecedented environmental challenges may not result in the hoped‐for set of ecosystem services. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2018;14:598–600. © 2018 SETAC
