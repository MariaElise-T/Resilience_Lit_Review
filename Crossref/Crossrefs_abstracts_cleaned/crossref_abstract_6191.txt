What happens when the research lens is turned inward? As a Strategic Designer, I spend most of time planning for research to engage with people so I can better understand their needs and behaviors and turn research insights into actionable solutions.

It's a visual story about a journey of pain and loss, but also strength through discovery, experimentation, and adaptability.
