 The plant hormone jasmonate coordinates immune and growth responses to increase plant survival in unpredictable environments. The core jasmonate signaling pathway comprises several functional modules, including a repertoire of COI1–JAZ (CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1–JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN) coreceptors that couple jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine perception to the degradation of JAZ repressors, JAZ-interacting transcription factors that execute physiological responses, and multiple negative feedback loops to ensure timely termination of these responses. Here, we review the jasmonate signaling pathway with an emphasis on understanding how transcriptional responses are specific, tunable, and evolvable. We explore emerging evidence that JAZ proteins integrate multiple informational cues and mediate crosstalk by propagating changes in protein–protein interaction networks. We also discuss recent insights into the evolution of jasmonate signaling and highlight how plant-associated organisms manipulate the pathway to subvert host immunity. Finally, we consider how this mechanistic foundation can accelerate the rational design of jasmonate signaling for improving crop resilience and harnessing the wellspring of specialized plant metabolites.
