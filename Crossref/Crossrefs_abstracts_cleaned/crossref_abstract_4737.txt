This research article uses descriptive-qualitative research to describe and analyze factors forming community resilience affected by floods. The determination of informants is determined deliberately on flood-affected communities using criteria according to the purpose of the study. Primary data were obtained from in-depth observations and interviews, while secondary data were obtained from library sources and relevant data. The data collection techniques used were observation, interviews, and documentation, while the data were analyzed using descriptive-qualitative analysis through several stages, namely data reduction, data presentation, and conclusions. The results of this study show that factors forming the resilience of the community to flood disasters are: (1) Value factors that have existed in the community for many years in the flooded land, namely mutual assistance; (2) Economic factors, finding alternative jobs or coping strategies by flood-affected communities; (3) Social factors, namely knowledge and skills to adapt to flood disasters through non-formal training and counselling on disaster and disaster mitigation from their experience or obtained through social media and mass media, such as television and radio; (4) Institutional factors, namely socialization of early flood warning, socialization of flood disaster mitigation, appeals for the prohibition of throwing garbage in rivers and essential food assistance before and during the occurrence of flood by the relevant government; and (5) Infrastructure factors that include the construction of facilities and infrastructure such as river dredging, drainage construction, and river cliff protection walls.
