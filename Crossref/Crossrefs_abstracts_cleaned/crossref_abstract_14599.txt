The aim of this paper was to review research investigating resilient outcomes for people with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and implications for practice, as well as to consider issues for clearer definitions. Fifty English language peer‐reviewed studies (1991–2010) met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed papers identified a number of factors that were repeatedly associated with individuals showing resilient outcomes to CSA. These included inner resources (e.g. coping skills, interpretation of experiences and self‐esteem), family relationships, friendships, community resources (e.g. church or school), as well as some abuse‐related factors (e.g. older age at onset). A large number of methodological concerns within these studies were also noted, including the way in which resilience, CSA and protective factors were defined. However, despite this, many papers identified similar factors that could be utilised to develop both effective prevention programmes and resilience interventions for the survivors of CSA.

There is a wealth of research investigating resilience in people who have experienced CSA.
Many papers presented similar findings. Interpersonal features were repeatedly identified; but importantly so were familial support and stability, peer friendships, appropriately timed social support, academic success, spirituality and a sense of community.
It seems likely that health promotion initiatives and social policies and programmes can improve resilient outcomes for people with a history of CSA, using both individual and systemic interventions.‘Many papers presented similar findings’
