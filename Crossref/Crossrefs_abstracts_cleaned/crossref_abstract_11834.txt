 In fact, most organisations invest great resources to develop and integrate information technology (IT) and its use. Information technology capabilities (ITC) can generate a positive impact on organisations in many different ways. This study analyses how ITC affect organisational resilience (OR) through information quality (IQ) and strategic flexibility (SF). It studies the mediating role of IQ and the modulating effect of environmental turbulences (market and technological). The developed model was appreciated using data from 400 firms. The data were treated using structured equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicate that ITC strongly and positively impact SF through IQ to increase OR. We also demonstrate that environmental turbulence moderates the influence of SF on OR, but does not have an effect on the interrelationship between IT and SF. The developed and tested model defines a critical and pragmatic pathway for OR through a capability view.
