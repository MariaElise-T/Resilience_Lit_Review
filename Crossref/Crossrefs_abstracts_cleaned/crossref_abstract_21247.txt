This study evaluated the efficacy of a brief (four 2-h sessions) group-based resilience-enhancement program focused on emotion regulation in Japan. Mothers (n = 123) of children aged 3–6 years were recruited in two prefectures and allocated with stratified randomization by the prefecture to either a bi-weekly intervention or treatment as usual. Mothers self-reported online at pre/post-intervention and at 2-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance was used to compare groups. At post-intervention and 2-month follow-up, the intervention group mothers showed significant improvements compared to the control group in resilience (p < 0.001/p = 0.001), self-esteem (p = 0.008/p = 0.001), anger control toward the child (p < 0.001/p = 0.012), and positive attribution toward the child’s misbehavior (p < 0.001/p = 0.003). The partners of mothers in both groups answered the same questionnaire at the same timepoints without participating in either program; no differences between groups were found. This study was the first randomized controlled trial investigating how a resilience-enhancement program improves maternal resilience, emotion regulation, and cognition toward children and themselves. This preliminary study provides evidence that improving resilience may reduce the risk of child maltreatment. Further research regarding implementing this intervention in the community is warranted.
