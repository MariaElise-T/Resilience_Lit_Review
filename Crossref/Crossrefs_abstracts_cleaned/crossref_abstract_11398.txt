This article describes using a nonlinear APVIOBPCS to model the resilience response to the failure of one of the suppliers of a two-tier supply chain comprising a retailer and two suppliers. The second supplier then supplies all the goods required by the retailer. The model is chosen as the simplest case to examine resilience. Time to recover from disruption to ship all goods required by customers is slightly worse when the order rate when it reaches capacity limits but is less than the delay in the system from supplier to final shipment. Just over one weeks' maximum shipments stock at each tier guarantees shipments impervious to the collapse of one supplier, controller type has little effect on the performance of the model. These results agree with other researchers in general trend but not in detail. The response does not match the â€˜Resilience Triangle.'
