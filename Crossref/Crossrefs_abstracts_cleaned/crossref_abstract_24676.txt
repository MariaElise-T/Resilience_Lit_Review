AbstractWe recently identified HAPSTR1 (C16orf72) as a key component in a novel pathway which regulates the cellular response to molecular stressors, such as DNA damage, nutrient scarcity, and protein misfolding. Here, we identify a functional paralog to HAPSTR1: HAPSTR2. HAPSTR2 formed early in mammalian evolution, via genomic integration of a reverse transcribed HAPSTR1 transcript, and has since been preserved under purifying selection. HAPSTR2, expressed primarily in neural and germline tissues and a subset of cancers, retains established biochemical features of HAPSTR1 to achieve two functions. In normal physiology, HAPSTR2 directly interacts with HAPSTR1, markedly augmenting HAPSTR1 protein stability in a manner independent from HAPSTR1â€™s canonical E3 ligase, HUWE1. Alternatively, in the context of HAPSTR1 loss, HAPSTR2 expression is sufficient to buffer stress signaling and resilience. Thus, we discover a mammalian retrogene which safeguards fitness.
