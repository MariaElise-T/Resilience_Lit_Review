This poem discusses resilience as an adaption to circumstances children cannot control. It comes from the viewpoint that resilience assumes that there is something to which one can bounce back. However, children who are placed in the foster care system and/or adopted, especially from birth, are born into spaces to which there is no return, yet they are labeled resilient. Children who experience these traumatic circumstances are not resilient, they are adaptable and learn how to thrive and move forward.&nbsp;
