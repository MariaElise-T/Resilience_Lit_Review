 Adolescents who have been incarcerated are at extreme risk for poor adult outcomes. However, some former youth offenders become successful, happy adults, presenting a profile of strength and coping known as resilience. This article describes the results of a 5-year qualitative examination of resilience among a group of adolescents transitioning from youth correctional facilities back into their communities. Topics discussed include predelinquent histories, experiences in the correctional system, and postcorrections transition. Currently about half of the respondents are successfulâ€”employed, going to school, or raising children. Others are less stable and may be at risk of being rearrested. Internal and situational factors accounting for these differences are discussed. Implications for practice include restructuring post-corrections transition services and improving school-based supports to at-risk youth.
