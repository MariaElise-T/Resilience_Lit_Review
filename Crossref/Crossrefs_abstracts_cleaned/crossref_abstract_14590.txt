PurposeDrawing on dynamic capability theory, this study investigates how onlineâ€“offline channel integration (OOCI) affects a firm's supply chain resilience and how such an effect is moderated by market turbulence and regulatory uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 273 Chinese firms that conduct online and offline business and hierarchical regression analysis were used to examine the research model.FindingsThe results suggest that the effect of OOCI on supply chain resilience differs in terms of its dimensions (i.e. information integration, transaction integration and service integration). While information integration and service integration were positively associated with supply chain resilience, transaction integration had a non-significant relationship with supply chain resilience. Moreover, market turbulence negatively moderated the effect of transaction integration and positively moderated the effect of service integration. Regulatory uncertainty positively moderated the effect of transaction integration and negatively moderated the effect of service integration. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.Originality/valueThis study examines the effect of OOCI on supply chain resilience. It further explores the influence of market turbulence and regulatory uncertainty on the relationship between OOCI and supply chain resilience.
