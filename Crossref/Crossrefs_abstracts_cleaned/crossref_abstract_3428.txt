Agrarian land-use in the village Fjelie, southern Sweden, AD 1000–1800, was studied through analysis of plant macrofossils, pollen, animal bones and strontium isotopes. Three different farmsteads in the village were studied and compared with other villages in the Öresund region. The composition of crop and animal husbandry was relatively constant through time, apart from a distinct increase in rye cultivation and a slight increase in cattle keeping. Similarities in crop composition between the farmsteads indicate that infield arable farming was practised in collaboration, since the 13th century probably in a three-course rotation system. Also, herding of livestock in grazing commons and fallow infields were collective efforts, whereas vegetable gardening, fishing, beer brewing and the species-composition of livestock showed differences between the individual farmsteads. The agricultural system of the village was characterised by diversity, which was reflected in several different spheres: crops and animals, ecosystems, labour intensity and organisation. Further, fishing contributed to resilience by reducing dependency on agriculture. The high diversity within the framework of village agriculture probably contributed to sustainable management of the resources and to agricultural and social resilience.
