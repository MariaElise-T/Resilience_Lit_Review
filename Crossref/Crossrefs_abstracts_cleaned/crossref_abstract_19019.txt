AbstractSupplier–buyer exchange relationship and quality of that relationship (supplier satisfaction and commitment) have been examined from various angles in the extant literature. Yet, there is a paucity of research investigating the influence of supplier characteristics – especially supplier resilience – on relationship quality. Driven to fill this gap, this study aims to develop theory of the influence of perceived benefits from supplier–buyer exchange relationship and supplier resilience on relationship quality. Data drawn from 97 supplier–buyer dyads were used. Hierarchical regression analyses showed the positive influence of both perceived benefits from supplier–buyer exchange relationships and supplier resilience on relationship quality. Further empirical and theoretical implications, as well as the limitations of the study, are discussed.
