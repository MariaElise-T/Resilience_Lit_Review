Child and youth care work is a stressful profession that results in workforce concerns about poor levels of staff retention and high levels of inexperience. The aim of this study is to gain insight into child and youth care workers’  resilience by examining the challenges faced by these workers and establish the methods used to overcome these challenges. This study employed a qualitative research method and data was collected from a child and youth care centre in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, employing a purposive sampling technique using 9 workers. Seven themes emerged from this study and it was evident that the respondents shared a common understanding of resilience. It was also found that an individual’s grassroots had an impact on developing a passion to work with young people as well as coping with work challenges. Positive protective factors that emerged were support systems in the organisation as motivators as well as maintaining a balance between work and personal life, while negative factors were low salaries and poor working conditions. The study concluded by recommending organisational interventions to support resilience in child and youth care workers and maintain expertise in child and youth care work.
