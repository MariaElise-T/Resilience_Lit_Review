Abstract
In this paper, we study the relationship between resilience and sustainable development in order to determine the place of road resilience in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as climate action and energy transition.
This study shows that road resilience is inseparable from adaptation to climate change, its mitigation and the energy transition. Therefore we address the issue of adapting road infrastructure to climate change and to the decarbonization of transport. It also emphasizes that resilience of road infrastructure is a necessary condition for any adaptation strategy and reminds us that the contribution of road transport to climate change mitigation overlaps in practice with the decarbonization goal resulting from energy transition.
