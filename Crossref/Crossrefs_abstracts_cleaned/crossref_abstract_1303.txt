Old age is often characterized as a period in life when people experience multiple stresses. These stresses include declining health and physical functioning and loss of meaningful relationships. However, a growing body of research indicates that old age can be characterized as a period of resilience when older adults use internal and external resources to overcome the challenges presented by this stage of life and function to the best of their abilities.
The purpose of this article is to present a stress and resiliency framework for teaching adult development and aging content throughout the social work undergraduate-level curriculum. The concept of resiliency is closely related to the strengths perspective, which serves as the unifying conceptual framework that informs most ideas about social work practice with the elderly. This model, when incorporated into the curriculum, helps in increasing a student's comprehensive understanding of aging and gerontology and is conductive in contributing to a well-rounded view of the challenges presented by old age and the coping strategies elders utilize to meet these. Such an approach is consistent with social work values and ethics.
Examples of how this framework is implemented in social work Human Behavior in the Social Environment courses, social work practice, social work policy, and research courses will be presented.
