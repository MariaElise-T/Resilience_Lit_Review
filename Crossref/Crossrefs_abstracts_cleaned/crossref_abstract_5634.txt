The present study examined the relationship between expressing emotions, psychological resilience and subjective well-being. The study was carried out with a total of 217 university students, of whom 94 were males and 123 were females, aged between 19 and 25 years. The data of the study were collected using the Emotional Expression Questionnaire, the Psychological Resilience Scale and the Subjective Well-Being Scale, respectively. The relationship between the variables of the study was analyzed via the methods of Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Structural Equation Modeling, and the mediating role of psychological resilience between emotional expression and subjective well-being was tested. The goodness-of-fit indices obtained from the structural equation modeling indicated that the model generated a good fit. According to the results, there was a significant relationship between &ldquo;expressing emotions&rdquo; and &ldquo;psychological resilience&rdquo; and between &ldquo;psychological resilience&rdquo; and &ldquo;subjective well-being&rdquo;. It was found that there was no significant relationship between expressing emotions and subjective well-being and that the variable of expressing emotions affected that of subjective well-being by means of the psychological resilience (tool) variable and the model tested was significant.
