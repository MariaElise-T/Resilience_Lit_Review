 Despite popular intents and plans to eradicate child-care institutions from the national scenario, institutional care remains the dominant model of alternative care for children among countries in the global South. Moreover, complete eradication of these residential institutions has multiple practical constraints.

This study outlines certain best practices regarding how multiple stakeholders within resident childrenâ€™s immediate ecological context might facilitate healthy adjustment in an atmosphere of trust and support.
