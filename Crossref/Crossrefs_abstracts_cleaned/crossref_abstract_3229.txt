AbstractWe use the Covid‚Äê19 crisis to assess how four capability domains that traditionally support corporate performance (agility, innovation, ecosystem play and digitization) can also predict corporate resilience, among global firms. Our results are based on a blend of advanced machine learning techniques that capture the complementarities among capabilities. We confirm that dynamic capabilities boost recovery, but especially when linked with aggressive leadership posture, e.g. rebound is more likely when firms are the main player/orchestrator of their business ecosystems as well as when they invest in disruptive, as opposed to incremental innovations.
