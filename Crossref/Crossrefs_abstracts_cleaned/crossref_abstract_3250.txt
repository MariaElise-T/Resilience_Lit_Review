Modern, systemic understanding of resilience as the ability of the
   individual, but also the community and other systems to select and provide
   the resources needed for positive functioning despite risk exposure, has
   opened space for designing programs that will provide the same resources. A
   review of the literature shows that experts and scientists have successfully
   directed the results of practice, which refer to the positive systems
   functioning despite the presence of risk, to create recommendations for
   designing programs that will help individuals, communities and other systems
   to build resilience. Such programs are of particular importance for victim
   empowerment. This paper aims to explain the basic assumptions of the
   effectiveness of programs aimed at building system resilience, which relate
   to the elements of assessment, design principles and key characteristics of
   resilience-building programs.
