AbstractWe introduce a formal framework for the study of augmenting networks in the plane for disaster‐resilience, where a disaster is modeled by a straight‐line segment. We generalize various graph structures from classical 2‐edge‐connectivity, including minimal cuts and blocks. The key concept that we introduce is that of an ‐leaf, which builds on the fundamental “leaf‐block” concept from classical augmentation. We present a number of algorithms for constructing the above‐mentioned graph structures, including a sweep‐line algorithm that finds all edge‐cuts that can be destroyed by a single disaster. We also present an algorithm which optimally adds a single edge between a pair of ‐leaves or blocks while avoiding certain disaster regions. Finally, we present a number of heuristic schemes for solving the disaster‐resilient network augmentation problem and perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the power of the ‐leaf concept within heuristic design.
