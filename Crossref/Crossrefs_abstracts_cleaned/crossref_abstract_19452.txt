AbstractThe International Workshop on Seismic Design and Assessment for Resilience, Robustness and Sustainability of Slope Engineering was held on 13–15 January 2023 on line, focusing on the theme of “Seismic resilience of slope engineering and the concept of resilience-based seismic design (RBSD) for geological disaster prevention and control”. In this workshop, a number of keynote and invited lectures provided an international exchange platform for researchers, industrial engineers and students to share their research, engineering practice and exchange novel ideas on seismic resilience for slope engineering in a way of online. At the same time, during this workshop, technical committee of the ICGdR-TC1 also took this opportunity to hold a working meeting on cutting-edge and strategic issues, and released the Shanghai Declaration on slope engineering.
