Abstract
Demand for land has increased very rapidly in line with population development and economic growth. In an effort to achieve high economic growth, land productivity is spurred in such a way as to result in the increased exploitation of natural resources which has an impact on the destruction of forests, land, water, air, and biodiversity. The concept of sustainable use of natural resources will face various challenges because, on the one hand, increased economic resilience must be encouraged, while on the other hand, ecological aspects and physical preservation of the landscape must be maintained. The study was aimed at finding out the historical basis of forest land-use change and recommendations for sustainable land use models based on the economic and ecological adaptation of farmers around the buffer zone of Lore Lindu National Park (TNLL), Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This type of research is qualitative research to describe the history of land-use change and ecological adaptation. Meanwhile, economic risk analysis is used to explain the economic adaptation of farmers. The results showed that land use with agroforestry systems was the result of the economic and ecological adaptation of farmers based on the economic and climate change risks faced by farmers around forests.
