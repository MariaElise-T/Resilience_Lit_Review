Climate change is increasing the severity of extreme weather events, particularly hurricanes, presenting a significant challenge to Caribbean coastal communities. In the aftermath of a major disaster, government interventions typically prioritise infrastructure, assets, and the economy through rebuilding roads, reviving economic sectors, and providing financial compensation. This is driven by a focus on macro‐level quantitative indicators rather than by local, multidimensional subjective and relational factors, closer to lived experiences and livelihoods. Using frameworks outlining social well‐being and agency, this paper explores strategies used by a fisheries‐dependent community in Dominica to recover from Hurricane Maria in 2017 and pursue well‐being. The findings highlight the importance of multidimensional well‐being, particularly relational and subjective dimensions, including existing social networks, and personal relationships critical for recovery after Maria. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how recovery initiatives that concentrate solely on material well‐being, such as employment, can undermine agency in the capacity of a community to recover and build resilience.
