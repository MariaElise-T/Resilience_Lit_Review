Results: Factors influencing the turnover intention of the subjects were role conflict, the current department satisfaction, career of physician assistant, position and type of work among general characteristics. The most significant factor influencing turnover intention was the satisfaction of current department(β=-.29, p<.001), followed by role conflict(β=.29, p<.001), career of physician assistant(β=-.23, p=.001), position(β=-.19 p=.011) and type of work(β=.17 p=.020).
