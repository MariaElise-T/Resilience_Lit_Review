Objective: To know the influence of the environment (family functionality, social support and neighbourhood and school environment) on the development of adolescent resilience. Methods: Descriptive, correlational design. A total of 184 adolescents from six schools in the Aranjuez district of Medellín participated. Probabilistic, two-stage sampling. Five scales were used to collect data: 1) The child and youth resilience measurement scale; 2) The neighbourhood environment questionnaire; 3) The family cohesion and adaptability assessment scale; 4) The multidimensional scale of perceived social support; and 5) The school environment questionnaire. Data were analysed though SPSS 24v software. Results: a relationship was found between resilience and neighbourhood environment (rs = .324, p = .000), family functionality (rs = .380, p = .000), social support (rs = .456, p = .000) and school environment (rs = .353, p = .000). In addition, resilience was explained in 35.8 % by the neighbourhood environment (β = .20; p = .012), family functionality (β = .13; p = .090), social support (β = .30; p = .000) and school environment (β = .15; p = .064). Conclusion: Adolescent resilient behaviour is influenced by social support, family functioning, and school and neighbourhood environment, all external factors fostering self-regulation, as mentioned by Roy’s Nursing model.
