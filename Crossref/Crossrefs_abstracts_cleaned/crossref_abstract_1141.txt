Abstract
Climate change has implications for the environment and community such as the existence of climate-related disasters. The changes of weather cycle triggers flooding in coastal areas, then high water discharge eroded the soil and caused landslides. Land conversion of upstream area causes low water absorption and high run-off which also contributes to flooding and landslides in the downstream area. Efforts to normalize rivers and urban drainage have not been able to cope with floods and landslides. Therefore, it needs an effort to minimize these disasters. The vegetative approach is an alternative for mitigating floods and landslides that are considered more comprehensive which not only conserves landscapes but also contributes to increasing green open space provision. This study aims to analyse the possibility of applying a vegetative approach to improve the physical and socio-economic communityâ€™s resiliency in coastal areas from climate-related disasters. The research method used a quantitative method with data collection techniques through literature studies, field observations, and questionnaires. The data processing stages include analysis of the physical condition to determine the physical vulnerability of the area through the physical natural map overlay technique; analysis of the climate-related disasters impact on society through descriptive statistical analysis techniques; and analysis of the possibility of applying the vegetative approach by using spatial analysis techniques to determine the level of vulnerability and priority zones for vegetation development.
