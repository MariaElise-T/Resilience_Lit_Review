As the critical object of ecological civilization construction, the risk of supply chain interruption in green building is increasing. Identifying the weak links of the green building supply chain and evaluating the resilience level is significant in promoting the green development of the construction industry. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the green building supply chain, this paper constructs the evaluation index system of green building supply chain resilience and uses the interpretative structural model (ISM) to analyze the correlation degree between evaluation indexes. Secondly, the ANP-Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is established to evaluate the resilience of the green building supply chain. Finally, an empirical study is conducted on a green building project in Jiaozuo City. According to the results, the ANP-Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can objectively evaluate the resilience level of the green building supply chain and apply it to practical case analysis.
