In this paper, the problem of H\(\infty\) output-tracking control for T-S fuzzy markov jump systems(MJSs) with imperfect premise matching is investigated. The conditional probability information between the system and the controller is imperfectly known. Firstly, due to the in influence of network-induce delay, the system mode information can not be transmitted to the controller synchronously, thus, a discrete-time hidden markov model(HMM) is established to describe the asynchronous phenomenon between the system and the controller; Secondly, form the prospectively of practical applications, packet loss in two channels is taken into consideration, which is caused by denial-of-service(DOS) attacks; Thirdly, in order to improve the data transmission efficiency and save network bandwidth resources, a novel resilient adaptive event-triggered(AET) mechanism is proposed, in which the event-based threshold parameter is dynamically regulated over the processing. Additionally, resorted the compensation principle and the lyapunov-krasovski(L-K) functions methods, some sufficient conditions in form of liner matrix inequality(LMI) are achieved to co-guarantee the stability and H\(\infty\) tracking property of the closed-loop system; Finally, two examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our design mentality.
