AbstractA systematic literature review on quantitative methods to assess community resilience was conducted following Institute of Medicine and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute standards. Community resilience is the ability of a community to bounce back or return to normal after a disaster strikes, yet there is no agreement on what this actually means. All studies reviewed addressed natural disasters, but the methodological approaches can be applied to technological disasters, epidemics, and terrorist attacks. Theoretical frameworks consider the association between vulnerability, resilience, and preparedness, yet these associations vary across frameworks. Because of this complexity, indexes based on composite indicators are the predominant methodological tool used to assess community resilience. Indexes identify similar dimensions but observe resilience at both the individual and geographical levels, reflecting a lack of agreement on what constitutes a community. A consistent, cross-disciplinary metric for community resilience would allow for identifying areas to apply short-term versus long-term interventions. A comparable metric for assessing geographic units in multiple levels and dimensions is an opportunity to identify regional strengths and weaknesses, develop timely targeted policy interventions, improve policy evaluation instruments, and grant allocation formulas design.
