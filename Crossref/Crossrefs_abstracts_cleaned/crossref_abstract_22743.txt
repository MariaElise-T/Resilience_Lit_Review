ABSTRACT  Objective: To analyze the resilience of people with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Method: Cross-sectional study carried out with 235 people with diabetes using a form shared on social media with sociodemographic and clinical data and the Connor-Davidson resilience scale validated for the Brazilian context. Scale scores were compared with sociodemographic and clinical data using Studentâ€™s t-test, analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney.  Results: The mean score on the resilience scale was 63.58+14.5. The highest resilience scores were evidenced in men, people with higher income, higher education, users of oral antidiabetics, who had healthy diet and who performed physical activity and follow-up with the health team.  Conclusion: Mean resilience was lower than the score shown in the literature and groups with higher scores had better health behaviors.
