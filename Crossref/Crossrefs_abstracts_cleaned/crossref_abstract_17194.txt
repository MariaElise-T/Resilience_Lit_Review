Background Throughout and following the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, there is an urgent need to focus on organizational support strategies aimed at improving the resilience of nurses. Purpose This research aims to examine the relationship between the nursesâ€™ perceived organizational support and their resilience levels, and to reveal the characteristics that make a significant difference. Methods The data of this descriptive and cross-sectional study were collected from 722 nurses in February 2021 using the web-based survey method. The study followed the STROBE guideline. The data collection tools included the Introductory Information Form, the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support, and the Psychological Resilience Scale. Results Nurses were concluded to have perceived a moderate level of organizational support and their psychological resilience were found to be higher than average. A positive relationship was determined between the organizational support perceived by nurses and their psychological resilience. The gender, position/title of nurses, their work experience in COVID-19 treatment services, and having been infected with the COVID-19 virus were found to affect their perception of organizational support and resilience. Conclusion Organizational support perceived by nurses significantly affects their resilience. Resilience programs should, in particular, prioritize permanent clinical nurses who are in the risk group in terms of resilience, female nurses, nurses who had been infected with the COVID 19 virus, and nurses who have been assigned to COVID-19 treatment wards.
