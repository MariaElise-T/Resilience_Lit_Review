This study examined relationships among coaching success, servant leadership, team cohesion, athlete resilience and social behaviors utilizing responses from over 300 collegiate athletes. Hornâ€™s (2008) model of coaching effectiveness served as the basis from which variables were operationalized and concurrently measured. Bivariate correlation analysis identified significant correlations among servant leadership and coaching success, cohesion and coaching success, cohesion and servant leadership, resilience and coaching success, and resilience and servant leadership, with most relationships moderate to weak. Canonical correlations were used to examine the data in greater depth and significant canonical variants revealed both expected and unexpected relationships. Multivariate analysis of variance results identified a significant main effect and seven significant follow-up analysis of variance tests. Athlete resilience, coach servant leadership and task-based team cohesion all varied significantly across the three levels of coaching success. Results of this study can be used by coaches, athletic administrators and coach educators for coach development.
