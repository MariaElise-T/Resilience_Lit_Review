(1) Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated disorder that affects the Central Nervous System and is the most common cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults. The study aimed to assess the levels of stress, resilience, well-being, sleep quality, and fatigue in Israeli people with MS (PwMS), and to examine the associations between these factors and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. These factors had never before been studied in conjunction in PwMS, nor had they been systematically addressed in Israel, the unique geopolitical situation of which may pose unique challenges. (2) Methods: This was a survey-based, cross-sectional study conducted through an Internet platform. (3) Results: Israeli PwMS who participated in the study were experiencing relatively high levels of stress and low resilience, poor sleep quality, and severe fatigue. The analysis revealed significant associations between resilience and stress, well-being, and anxiety, as well as stress and well-being, resilience, sleep quality, fatigue, and Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). (4) Conclusions: the Israeli PwMS who participated in the study were experiencing higher levels of stress, lower resilience and worse sleep quality than PwMS in other countries, as compared to results previously reported in literature. The findings of this study ought to serve as a call to action for the MS care providers in Israel and warrant further research into the possible causes of the phenomenon and strategies to address it.
