Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is a disease of human system in which body‟s normal defense system breaks down. Immune –activation has emerged as a critical factor distinguishing pathogenic immunodeficiency virus infections – such as HIV infection. The level of social support given to an individual during a health crisis has been documented to have a profound impact on a person‟s physical and psychological well-being. The capacity to cope and feel competent is referred to as resilience. Psychological resilience refers to an individual‟s capacity to withstand stressors and manifest psychological dysfunction, such as mental illness or persistent negative mood. This study examines the effect of hardiness dimensions of commitment, challenge and control as resilience factors and social support on immune-activation among persons with symptomatic HIV disease and AIDS. The study has been conducted at ART Centre Department of Medicine, S.S. Hospital Banaras Hindu University Varanasi. Total samples of 40 HIV positive people in the age range of 21 to 55 years have been taken for the study. Dispositional Resilience (Hardiness) Scale is a self- report scale that is designed to measures three major component of hardiness (control, commitment and challenge) constructed by Bartone, P.T.(1989) and Multidimensional scale of social support constructed by Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet and Farlay (1988) were administered on the sample. The finding indicated that HIV positive people having high hardiness, gain more social support and their Immune-activation has been found also in increased level.
