Purpose
Resiliency is essential for achieving the necessary level of performance and ensuring the survival of a new business during difficult times. However, neither this characteristic nor its antecedents have been exhaustively studied. Using a configuration approach, this study aims to analyze the neuropsychological and business-related characteristics of entrepreneurs that may explain their resilience during the business development process.


Design/methodology/approach
Using the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the authors investigated distinct characteristics of Costa Rican agro-entrepreneurs with high levels of entrepreneurial resilience. The fsQCA methodology identifies combinations of causal measures that result in the outcome.


Findings
From the mixture of configurations, the authors found four combinations of individual’s characteristics that explain the profile of a resilient agro-entrepreneur.


Originality/value
This work contributes to the literature on agricultural entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial resilience. This study identifies four distinct combinations of entrepreneurs’ characteristics that produce entrepreneurial resilience in the agricultural industry. Moreover, it incorporates individuals’ business-related attributes into examining characteristics combinations that affect resilience. Also, this research offers agro-entrepreneurs’ stakeholders, valuable insights to develop more resilient entrepreneurs.
