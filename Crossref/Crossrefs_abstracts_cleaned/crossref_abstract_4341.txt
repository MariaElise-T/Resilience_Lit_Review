This paper utilizes anonymous qualitative survey commentary from seventy-three faculty to explore how perceptions of teaching undergraduate researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic reflect the practice of resilient pedagogy. By examining faculty motivations, experiences in times of disruption, and resiliency beyond the pandemic, this paper contributes to and extends the existing scholarship on resilience and resilient pedagogy in higher education.
