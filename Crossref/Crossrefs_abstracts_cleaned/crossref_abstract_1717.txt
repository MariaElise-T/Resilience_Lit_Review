Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) is one of the IP-based technologies that have been proposed to replace SONET/SDH in metropolitan area networks because it is well-adapted to handle diverse tra±c, including multimedia traffic, found in present-day networks. Additionally, the RPR network is used efficiently with nodes transmitting simultaneously as long as the paths of the packets do not overlap. However, when bridging RPR networks, packets are flooded on the bridged RPR network if the packet destination is on a remote network other than the source network. As a result, the network is used inefficiently, decreasing the available bandwidth for other traffic. In this paper, we propose enhanced topology discovery protocol and enhanced spanning tree protocol to prevent the flooding of packets on the bridged RPR network. Simulations were performed in order to evaluate the proposed solutions. The results show that the flooding of packets is successfully prevented and that the network is used more e±ciently as compared to the RPR
