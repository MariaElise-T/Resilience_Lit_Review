Lambeaux writen by Charles Juliet is the result of a trauma in his early infancy. A month after his birth, he is separated from his mother interned in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide tentative. His biological father entrusts him to a family who will love him and raise him like their own. When he becomes an adult he decides to write his biological motherâ€™s biography with his imagination because he had not enough information about her life and his autobiography bind to his adoptive mother. Writing becomes his resilience. Two people help him to achieve his goal: his adoptive mother and his French teacher who become resilience tutors. To improve his writing, the author reads French writers looking for words he can use in his own work. Lambeaux is finally the re-creation of the biological mother and her son as a writer.
