The concept of resilience tends, latterly, to become extremely popular in the fi eld of regional science, reverberating, to a great extent, the feeling of insecurity and uncertainty that prevails in regional economies many of which have become (extremely) vulnerable to the effects of internationalization and integration. Such a feeling is consolidated in the light of the on-going economic – and environmental – crisis. Resilience is a malleable concept: it is perceived in a different way by different people. The present study attempts to review and decompose the notion of resilience as it is perceived in the fi eld of regional science.
