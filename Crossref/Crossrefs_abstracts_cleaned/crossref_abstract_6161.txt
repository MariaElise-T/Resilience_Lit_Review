 This speech details my lived experience and coping strategies of a psychologist and academic diagnosed with a brain tumor. As an educator and researcher studying well-being and resilience, I summarize my experience of living through adversity and draws on the research that helped me do so. I specifically reflect on the literature of gratitude and well-being to take oppose the “fight” narrative presented at the forefront of the diagnosis. This speech script offers insight into this lived experience and calls for written speech to be utilized as a method of inquiry. Insights for healthcare practitioners and providers in navigating patient experience are discussed.
