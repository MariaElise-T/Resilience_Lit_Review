IntroductionLaw enforcement involves exposure to threatening situations and traumatic events that place police officers at risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes. Resilience support, among other elements of training, may help mitigate these risks, yet little is known about which aspects of resilience support help officers achieve better health and quality of life outcomes.Methods and analysisThis review will consider all literature that examines the links between resilience support, physical/mental health and quality of life outcomes for police officers in five Anglosphere nations: Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. This review will include all literature (including those that show null or negative links) involving any public policing agency that has a formal rank structure and includes a localized, uniformed emergency response function. Resilience support may include, but is not limited to: tools, policies, models, frameworks, programmes and organizational features that seek to promote positive, physical/mental health and quality of life outcomes at three levels of resilience: (1) readiness and preparedness, (2) response and adaptation, (3) recovery and adjustment. Peer reviewed and grey literature examining resilience support since 2000 that focuses on police officers are eligible for inclusion. Databases/sources to be searched will include: PsycINFO, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Public Affair Index, Campbell Collaboration, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Business Source Complete, Scopus and Google. Retrieval of full-text, English-language studies (and other literature), data extraction, data synthesis and data mapping will be performed independently by two reviewers, following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval is not required for this scoping review, and the literature search will start in November 2020 or upon acceptance of this protocol. The findings of the scoping review will be available [April 2021] and will be published in a peer reviewed journal.
