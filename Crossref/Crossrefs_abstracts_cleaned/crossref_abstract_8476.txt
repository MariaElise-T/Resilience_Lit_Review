Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to highlight and present the funding opportunities for Romania through the National Recovery and Resilience Programme, in order to make it more efficient to access and implement these forms of support. In this regard, the main research method is based on literature review in order to identify funding opportunities for more efficient implementation of support forms. At the same time, quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be used to assess the current level of funding through these programmes and mechanisms and to compare it with the needs, as well as with other European funding.
