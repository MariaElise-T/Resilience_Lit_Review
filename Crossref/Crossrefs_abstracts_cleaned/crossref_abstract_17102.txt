As one of the important parameters used in the analysis and design of subgrade, resilient modulus is directly related to the safety, economic and life time of subgrade structure. In this paper, the characteristics of resilient modulus of improved red clay at different additive content were studied through conducting laboratory repeated load tri-axial tests. The influence of stress state, moisture content, compactness, additive types, and content on resilient modulus were analyzed. In addition, the regression analysis of resilient modulus, was carried out referencing three existing prediction models. The results showed that the Andrei model can better fit the resilient modulus of red clay and have a higher determination coefficient. However, the Andrei model and other existing prediction models, reflect only the influence of stress state on resilient modulus, without considering the influence of moisture content, compactness and additive content. Therefore, based on the Andrei model, a comprehensive prediction model, which can reflect the influence of compactness, moisture content, additive content, and stress state on resilient modulus was introduced. Good agreement between the regression results and the measured ones demonstrated the integrative ability of the introduced model.
