Addressing the second priority of the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) for strengthening disaster risk governance, this paper considers coastal regions from a Socio-Ecological System (SES) perspective. It identifies the drivers of risk and critical linkages between various key components of coastal SESs that can potentially influence the resilience of coastal regions. The study considers that, in a coastal area, where the system is complex with numerous stakeholders, any decision taken in the form of developmental policy or as an adaptive practice is critical for system changes, thereby making risk anticipation and its management difficult. To further conduct a detailed investigation of this subject, seven settlements along the coastal Andhra Pradesh (India) region were methodically selected. Herein, focus group discussions were conducted to prepare fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), which were further analyzed through the mental modeler online platform. By analyzing the structural metrics of the FCM, saltwater intrusion was identified as a significant system component. Furthermore, the study also analyzed the effects of change on the characteristics of selected SES components regarding the effectiveness of existing governance strategies and, conversely, the impact of implementing governance strategies on the identified critical components of SES. By critically examining the various scenarios thus generated, the research identifies various components, generating vulnerabilities in human systems. The derived results were cross-validated through community consultation, and the temporal variations in the state of system components were mapped. The study is expected to provide considerable input to policymakers for enhancing decision-making in coastal regions from an SES perspective.
