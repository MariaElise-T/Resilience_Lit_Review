Evidence-based research has highlighted the need for exploring factors that support the mental health of men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS (MSMLWH), and environmental influences that promote their resilience to HIV/AIDS. This exploratory study utilized a community-based participatory research approach to investigate barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS, specifically among racial and ethnic minority, middle-aged and older MSMLWH, a population that continues to be significantly impacted by HIV/AIDS today. This collaborative, qualitative study recruited participants who identified as racial or ethnic minority MSMLWH, were aged 40 or older, and resided in Ontario, Canada. Participants (n = 24) discussed in their interviews barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS, which they recognized from their lived experiences. Utilizing thematic analysis, themes related to barriers and facilitators to promoting resilience to HIV/AIDS were identified. Themes related to identified barriers included: (1) language proficiency, (2) racism, (3) pernicious norms in North American gay culture, and (4) HIV stigma. Themes related to identified facilitators included: (1) compartmentalization, (2) perseverance, and (3) community-based health and social services. This article discusses the implications of the studyâ€™s findings, particularly on how they may influence the development of future services for racial and ethnic minority, middle-aged and older MSMLWH.
