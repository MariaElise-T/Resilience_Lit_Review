Abstract
The requisite role of HER3 in HER2-amplified cancers is beyond what would be expected as a dimerization partner or effector substrate and it exhibits a substantial degree of resiliency that mitigates the effects of HER2-inhibitor therapies. To better understand the roots of this resiliency, we conducted an in-depth chemical-genetic interrogation of the signaling network downstream of HER3. A unique attribute of these tumors is the deregulation of TORC2. The upstream signals that ordinarily maintain TORC2 signaling are lost in these tumors, and instead TORC2 is driven by Akt. We find that in these cancers HER3 functions as a buffering arm of an Akt–TORC2 feed-forward loop that functions as a self-perpetuating module. This network topology alters the role of HER3 from a conditionally engaged ligand-driven upstream physiologic signaling input to an essential component of a concentric signaling throughput highly competent at preservation of homeostasis. The competence of this signaling topology is evident in its response to perturbation at any of its nodes. Thus, a critical pathophysiologic event in the evolution of HER2-amplified cancers is the loss of the input signals that normally drive TORC2 signaling, repositioning it under Akt dependency, and fundamentally altering the role of HER3. This reprogramming of the downstream network topology is a key aspect in the pathogenesis of HER2-amplified cancers and constitutes a formidable barrier in the targeted therapy of these cancers.
