Abstract. The study illustrates a university research project of “Digital Documentation’s Ontology”, to be activated with other universities, of an Platform (P) – Building Information Modeling (BIM) articulated on a Contaminated Hybrid Representation (diversification of graphic models); the latter, able to foresee categories of Multi-Representations that interact with each other for to favour several representations, adapted to a different information density in the digital multi-scale production, is intended as platform (grid of data and information at different scales, semantic structure from web content, data and information storage database, archive, model and form of knowledge and ontological representation shared) of: inclusive digital ecosystem development; digital regenerative synergies of representation with adaptable and resilient content in hybrid or semi-hybrid Cloud environments; phenomenological reading of the changing complexity of environmental reality; hub solution of knowledge and simulcast description of information of Cultural Heritage (CH); multimedia itineraries to enhance participatory and attractive processes for the community; factor of cohesion and sociality, an engine of local development. The methodology of P-BIM/CHR is articulated on the following ontologies: Interpretative and Codification, Morphology, Lexicon, Syntax, Metamorphosis, Metadata in the participatory system, Regeneration, Interaction and Sharing. From the point of view the results and conclusion the study allowed to highlight: a) Digital Regenerative synergies of representation; b) Smart CH Model for an interconnection of systems and services within a complex set of relationships.
