We provide an overview of the UK Penn Resilience Programme (UKPRP), a school-based well-being programme for children and young people piloted in the UK in 2007 and still in use today. The programme aims to build emotional resilience and promote accurate thinking, adaptive coping skills and social problem-solving. A formal evaluation of the pilot, funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, found significant improvements in secondary school pupilsâ€™ depression symptom scores, attendance at school and academic attainment. Smaller-scale evaluations of the subsequent implementation found positive impacts on teaching staff and primary school pupils. We describe the theoretical basis for UKPRP, how it was initially piloted in the UK, and how it is currently used, as well as providing a summary of the research evidence on its impact.
