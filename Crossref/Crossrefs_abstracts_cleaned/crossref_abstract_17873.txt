The impact of the current global pandemic on households’ economy in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. Undoubtedly, households’ resilience is threatened by the global pandemic that has ravaged the means of survival of people in both urban and rural areas. The onset of the lockdown that affected all individuals put setback on economic activities and this impacted negatively on the income of households. The already dwindling economy of households, especially those in rural areas become hampered thereby enhancing vulnerability. The poor becomes poorer because there is no back up that the poor could easily fall on. Also, the capacity to recover and adapt become impaired. The emergence of COVID 19 has implication for food security sustainability among households. This study employed the use of secondary sources to examine the vulnerability of households to the global pandemic and the ramifications of the effect of COVID 19 on households’ economy in the rural and urban areas of Nigeria. Containment strategies (such as innovative information system delivery, interest free loan especially to entrepreneurs, sensitization and promotion of home gardening particularly in urban, among others) that could stimulate households’ resilience or foster quick economic recovery in urban and rural Nigeria in the bid to ensure food security and livelihood sustainability were suggested.
