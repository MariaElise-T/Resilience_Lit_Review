 Nursing is a stressful occupation, and consequently, nurses are at risk for work-related burnout. This is highly problematic, as numerous negative consequences are associated with burnout. Most notably, burnout may result in nurses leaving the profession, thereby exacerbating the nursing shortage. The purpose of the present study was to advance the understanding of burnout in the nursing profession. Specifically, three types of work engagement (i.e., vigor, dedication, and absorption) and resiliency were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between work-related stress and burnout. Nurses and nursing students were recruited through a college and a state nursing association, and participants ( N =  76) completed a series of online surveys. Mediation models were assessed using multiple regression analyses and the bootstrapping method of testing indirect effects. Results indicated that vigor, dedication, absorption, and resiliency partially mediated the relationship between work-related stress and burnout, although the exact pattern of results varied depending on the specific type of burnout (Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment). These results could be useful in helping to prevent burnout in the nursing profession and should be taken into consideration when designing employee training and support programs.
