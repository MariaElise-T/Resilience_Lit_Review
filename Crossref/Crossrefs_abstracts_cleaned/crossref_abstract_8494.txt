The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large volume of disparate, dynamic and geographically distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. With astonishing technological innovations and convergence, there have been major changes in peoples daily activities and social interaction. The socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city, however, is subjected to the same challenges as a conventional city, such as environmental damages, hazard impacts, access to services and resources, due to continuous population and economic growth. Therefore, it is imperative to improve our understanding of Resilient and Intelligent Cities in order to leverage technologies and artificial intelligence to tackle the challenges cities face, which range from climate change, public health, traffic congestion, economic growth, to digital divide, social equity, political movements, and cultural conflicts, among others.
