Speech perception is remarkably resilient to signal perturbation. For example, Saberi and Perrott [Nature, 398, 760 (1999)] found that sentences in which successive segments as long as 130 ms have been temporally reversed are relatively intelligible. They suggested that ultra-low-frequency modulation envelopes (3â€“8 Hz) are critical to intelligibility. We tested whether information transmitted, not physical units (e.g., ms, Hz), better explains performance. Listeners heard a large cohort of synthesized, seven-syllable sentences at three different speaking rates (2.5, 5.0, 10 syllables/second) with time-reversed segments of multiple durations (20, 40, 80, 160 ms). Intelligibility decreased as duration of time-reversed segments increased, decreasing more slowly for slower (longer) sentences. When intelligibility is plotted to reflect proportion of message (not time) that was time reversed, data for all three rates collapse onto a single curve. To estimate potential information across time, we used spectral coherence to quantify the degree to which successive portions of the signal are similar to, or can be predicted from, a given spectral slice with no prior expectations such as knowledge of speech or language. Spectral coherence alone accounts substantially for performance. Information transmission, not physical measures of time or frequency, is more useful for understanding perception of speech.
