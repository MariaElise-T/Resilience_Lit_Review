IntroductionThe study aimed to compare factors influencing social adaptation of children from families at risk of social exclusion versus their peers with higher socioeconomic status. The analysis applied to coping strategies in difficult social situations as well as intrapersonal and interpersonal attitudes, and attitudes towards the world.Material and methodsThe study involved 169 children (girls n = 85, boys n = 84) aged 13-14 years. Children were included in the criterion group based on a statutory minimum subsistence level applicable for a given year in Poland.ResultsChildren with higher levels of resilience scored high in cognitive-intellectual and physical spheres as well as in personality, pro-social, socio-moral and support spheres and the sense of efficacy. Factors such as socioeconomic status and family structure were found to differentiate children in terms of coping mechanisms and attitudes towards themselves, other people and the world.ConclusionsThe study revealed that the child’s psychological resilience is of particular importance for social adaptation.
