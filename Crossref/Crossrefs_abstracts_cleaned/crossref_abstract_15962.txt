The primary frontline healthcare providers who have frequent contact with COVID-19 patients are nurses. Many nurses have been infected with COVID-19 and have experienced severe emotional exhaustion and burnout. It is essential to assess nurses’ psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to analyze the factors associated with burnout, resilience, and empowerment among Indonesian COVID-19 nurse survivors. In this cross-sectional study, 182 COVID-19 survivor nurses participated from September to November 2022 with convenience sampling. An online survey using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Psychological Empowerment Scale (PES) were used to collect data. The data were analyzed using descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses. The majority of the nurses were aged between 30–45 years (61.6%), and females (67.4%) experienced burnout. Higher resilience was found among nurses contracting COVID-19 (83.1%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the absence of psychological impact (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.21–0.93) is significantly related to higher burnout experience. In addition, workplace, especially in hospital (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 1.09–17.09) was associated with resilience, and a gap time after receiving negative COVID-19 result (OR = 3.90, 95% CI = 1.27–12.03) was correlated with psychological empowerment, in our results 4–6 month after had a negative result was at higher risk. To maintain a positive psychological aspect for COVID-19 nurse survivors, it needs to implement psychological support in the workplace and ensure an appropriate workload of nurse professionals.
