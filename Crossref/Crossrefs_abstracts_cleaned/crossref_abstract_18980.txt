 Introduction: The purpose of the research was to examine the relationship between Hispanic nursing students’ trauma experiences and the influence on resilience and learning outcomes. Methods: The study used quantitative, correlational methods to analyze the data. The survey tool included the Adverse Childhood Experience International Questionnaire, a resilience scale, and results from a standardized academic exam. Data Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and multivariate correlation analysis. Results: The results provide evidence of a negative relationship between trauma levels and resilience. As students’ trauma scores increased their level of resilience decreased. No observed significant relationship between the Hispanic nursing student’s lived trauma and learning outcomes was noted. Conclusion: This study will help in understanding the stressors that might affect students and help educators to create environments within the classroom that will allow students to overcome these stressors. Evidence identified that Hispanic nursing students experienced multiple traumatic childhood events. Through the study of traumatic experiences in nursing students, we garner insights into the prevalence of adverse experiences in this population. Additionally, given projections of a nursing shortage, evidence that lends insights to ensure Hispanic nursing student success will ultimately benefit nursing and patient care.
