 Besides the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) itself, the indirect and unprecedented effects of mitigation strategies including shelter-in-place orders and social distancing combined with the widespread COVID “infodemic” disseminated by media interacted synergistically to worsen already compromised mental health outcomes of Latino people living with HIV (PLWH). This funded project directly addresses the sources of health disparity in Miami Dade County: mental health and misinformation by developing a culturally tailored resilience and media literacy intervention for Latinos living with HIV. Extant research on resilience strategies and media literacy skills have documented their effectiveness in assisting individuals make realistic appraisals and informed decisions that could benefit their health outcomes and improve health-related challenges. We utilized a community-based approach by collaborating with two local community partners (Open Arms and Borinquen) and conducting 27 qualitative interviews with Latino PLWH, infectious disease providers, and community health workers who directly informed content of the Latino Unidos microgame intervention. This article describes the formative research process guiding the Latinos Unidos microgame intervention—a three-module gamified intervention. Study outcomes provide the foundation for media and educational strategies that increase adherence to health guidance and enhance mental health responses to adversity as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
