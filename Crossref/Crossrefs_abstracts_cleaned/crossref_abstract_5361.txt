 This study uses a narrative approach to explore the experiences of adults in the oldest stage of old age after they suffered a hip fracture. The focus was on participants’ perceptions and descriptions of the traumatic event, the recovery process, and the impact of the fracture on their lives. The study had a longitudinal design and included interviews with 10 participants (mean age 89) who had suffered hip fractures. Up to three semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of the participants (a total of 27 interviews) over a 3-month period. The first interviews were at the hospital, the second at municipal rehabilitation facilities, and the third at the participants’ homes. The material was analysed by means of narrative analysis. The results show how the incident affected the participants’ active and meaningful lives and how they seemed to mobilise their resources and motivation to train and recover to be able to come back home and resume the life they had before the hip fracture. The study provides nuances in the understanding of how a hip fracture can impact lives in old age. The stories emphasise the resources and capacity for resilience elderly people can possess and the importance of listening to the individual life stories, situation, personal goals, and needs when planning services for elderly people recovering from a hip fracture.
