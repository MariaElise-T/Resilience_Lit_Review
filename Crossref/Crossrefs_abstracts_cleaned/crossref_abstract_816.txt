Out-of-Field Teaching (OFT) has become one of the common concerns of different educational institutions in the global arena. Its prevalence worldwide has become a major issue because of its impact on the quality of education and the efficacy of teachers. Due to the shortage of specialized teachers in the field, school heads opted to hire out-of-field teachers to teach English subjects which creates a detrimental effect on professional growth, teachersâ€™ performance, and the well-being of teachers. Thus, this qualitative phenomenological paper explored the lived experiences of out-of-field teachers teaching English in public schools. The data were gathered from the six (6) participants who were chosen using a purposeful sampling technique and determined using the following inclusion criteria: non-English major, public secondary school teacher, and have at least two (2) years of experience in teaching English. The data were collected utilizing the in-depth unstructured interview. Employing a thematic analysis, the findings revealed the challenges encountered by the participants, and how they were able to endure and embrace all of them. Moreover, the findings highlighted the adaptability and resiliency of the participants as essential factors in overcoming the demands of the phenomenon. Thus, the findings imply how the lived experiences of the participants molded them to become a better version of themselves.
