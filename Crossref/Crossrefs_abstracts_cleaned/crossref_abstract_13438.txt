This study examined the role of resilience in the lives of cyberbullying perpetrators and their victims. Turkish adolescents (n = 444; 245 girls, 55.2%, and 199 boys, 44.8%) 15–19 years of age (mean age of 16.58 years, SD = 0.789) were recruited from different high schools. The participants completed the Cyberbullying Scale (Arıcak, Kınay, & Tanrıkulu, 2012), the Cybervictimisation Scale (Arıcak, Tanrıkulu, & Kınay, 2012), and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (Arslan, 2015). The data were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and simple regression. The Pearson correlations revealed that there were negative and significant correlations between cyberbullying perpetration and resilience (r = −.146, p < .01). There were negative and significant correlations between cybervictimisation and resilience (r = −0.203, p < 0.01). Simple regression also revealed that resilience was a significant individual predictor for both cyberbullying perpetration (β = −0.146, t = −3.094, p < .001) and cyber victimisation (β = −0.203, t = −4.357, p < .001).
