 Although the Self-Evaluation of Resilience (SEOR) scale is a promising tool for assessing resilience in healthcare, its psychometric structure has not yet been confirmed. This study aimed to assess and validate the four-factor psychometric structure of the SEOR. Between September 2020 and January 2021, cross-sectional data were collected from randomly selected healthcare workers, managers, and administrators from a predefined network of 70 healthcare facilities in 12 Italian regions. The sample size was based on a Monte Carlo simulation using estimates from the SEOR developmental study. Two confirmatory factor models (first-order and second-order) were predefined. The responders ( n = 199, response rate, 81%) were healthcare workers ( n = 99; 49.7%), managers ( n = 86; 43.2%), and administrators ( n = 14; 7%). The two confirmatory factor models each showed a good fit in explaining sample statistics, corroborating the capacity of the scale to provide a total score of resilience and sub-scores for organizational resilience, network-based resilience, skill-based resilience, and individual-based resilience. The Molenaar-Sijtsma coefficients (internal consistency) ranged between 0.889 and 0.927. The SEOR enables managers and policy-makers to comprehensively screen resilience in healthcare from an epidemiological perspective.
