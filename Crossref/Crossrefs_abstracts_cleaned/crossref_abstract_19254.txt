China’s economic development has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage, which promotes the sustainable economic development of the Yangtze River (YR) and also improves the response capacity of the YR basin’s resilience system to floods. Flood resilience (FR) is not only just the achievement of high-quality economic development (HQED) but also the key to mitigating flood damage (FD). Therefore, based on panel data from 2000 to 2019 from provincial administrative regions (PARs) in the Yangtze River basin (YRb), the entropy weight method and the quantitative regression analysis method were used to empirically investigate the impact of HQED and FR on FD in the YRb. The empirical analysis results show the following. (i) HQED has an inverted U-shaped effect on FD in the YRb, meaning that HQED will reach a certain point and reduce flood losses. (ii) The HQED model, which has been pushed forward, will significantly improve the level of FR. Various mediating effect test methods revealed that FR has a significant negative mediating effect on the process of HQED to mitigate FD. Taken together, this reveals the importance of insisting on implementing an HQED model to mitigate FD in the YRb, gradually deriving an FR that is adapted to floods and has a high self-organizing and self-restoring capacity through high-quality development.
