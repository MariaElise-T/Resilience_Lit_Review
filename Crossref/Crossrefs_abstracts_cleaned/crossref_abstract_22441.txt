Current study aimed to explore the role of resilience in relationship between death anxiety and dissociative symptoms among bereaved early adults. Correlation research design was applied. Sample consisted (n =250) participants with age ranging between 18-30 years (Mean =21.39; SD =2.52). Sample included two categories (n =150) bereaved with having equal proportion of men (n =75) and women (n =75), who have experienced the death of one or both of the parents during the two years and control sample consisted of (n=100) non-bereaved, male (n =50) and female (n =50). English version of Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety (ASDA), Severity of Dissociative Symptoms Adult, Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-B) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were administered to the participants. The results depicted positive correlation between death anxiety and dissociative symptoms, whereas death anxiety was inversely correlated resilience. Multiple regression analysis revealed that death anxiety was a significant predictor of dissociative symptoms. It was also indicated from the result that the bereaved adults experienced more dissociative symptoms and were less resilient as compared to non-bereaved adults. However bereaved women tended to be more resilient as compared to bereaved men. The finding of the study might provide directions in designing interventions for the bereaved to improve resilience through the use of various strategies.
