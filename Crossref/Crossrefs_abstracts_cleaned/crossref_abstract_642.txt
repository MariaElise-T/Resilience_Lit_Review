This practice note examines how climate change is threatening coffee-growing regions in Costa Rica, specifically the Coto Brus region. By 2050, absent adaptation measures, experts project that climate change will reduce the global areas suitable for growing coffee by about 50% (Bunn et al. 2015). The case study outlines key findings from this region, including main challenges and existing factors that present opportunities to enhance climate resilience, and recommends actions that key sectoral actors can take to improve the sector’s climate resilience and long-term sustainability.  Based on a literature review, interviews, a workshop and field visits with coffee farmers, government ministries, funders, and other stakeholders, this case study identified six key recommendations to increase the short-, medium-, and long-term climate resilience of the coffee sector. These are: promote promising adaptation options identified by stakeholders such as diversifying incomes of farmers and replanting farms with climate-resilient coffee varieties, with regular technical follow-up; establish baselines and monitor the impacts of adaptation measures; map out when and where coffee may no longer be viable in the coming decades, and how to support those farmers who may need to shift away from coffee; develop farmer-tailored business education; and expand peer-to-peer learning between farmers.  Despite the case study’s local focus, the lessons and experiences shared in this paper are relevant for other coffee-growing regions and countries ̶ Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Vietnam, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Uganda, and others ̶ where coffee producers are facing the effects of climate change, and hope that it will serve as a tool and inspiration for accelerating adaptation action.
