Abstract
Data mining in psychological experiments is to discover the relationship between other data and psychological data, so as to discover the psychological state of the subjects. Based on the psychological assessment data of students from Jiangsu Vocational College of Agriculture and Forestry during 2017-2019, we applied the association rules in big data processing to calculate the scores of personality, resilience and rigidity of investment behavior of the subjects. The following conclusions are drawn through analysis of promotion degree and correlation degree between values of each attribute. Firstly, pruning lift is of great significance to understand the associated relationship among personality, resilience and investment behavior rigidity. Secondly, the more openness individuals in the Big Five personality, the stronger the investment behavior rigidity. The stronger the neuroticism, the weaker the investment behavior rigidity. The stronger the extroversion, the stronger the investment behavior rigidity. Thirdly, psychological resilience as a mediator affects the impact of openness and neuroticism on the rigidity of investment behavior.
