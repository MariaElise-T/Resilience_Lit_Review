Strengthening urban resilience is one of the main goals of urban mitigation. This document explains the concept of urban mitigation and urban resilience and demonstrates spatial relevance of hazard and vulnerability. From three levels, including urban scale, urban spatial structure and urban open space, spatial design methods for urban mitigation to strength urban resilience, namely resistance, adaptability and transformation are proposed based on characteristics of different phases of disaster process.
