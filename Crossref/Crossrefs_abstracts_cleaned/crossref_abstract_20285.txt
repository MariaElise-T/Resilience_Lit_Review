Due to their geographical condition and worldwide environmental protection policies, the Galapagos Islands must opt for implementing clean energy infrastructure considering natural hazard effects that can directly affect the resilience of community residents. Santa Cruz Island is part of this archipelago, with rich biodiversity in flora and unique fauna. This study proposes identifying earthquake and tsunami risk assessment components on the island, such as the infrastructure vulnerability of Puerto Ayora, the central city of Santa Cruz Island. The FEMA P-154 and FEMA P-646 methodologies are used to classify buildings for technically installing microgrids based on photovoltaic generation systems. For this purpose, maps and data from state entities are used in combination with catalogs from development and land use planning, Software for Geoprocesses and virtual tours, and cadastral information provided by the Decentralized Autonomous Government (GAD) of Santa Cruz to develop techniques that offer a risk index to identify buildings that could sustain seismic and tsunamic loads. The study exposes alarming results that would prevent the installation of photovoltaic generation systems on the buildings’ roofs. Consequently, a more detailed field study is recommended to contrast the reported analysis to implement mitigation strategies accordingly. Finally, geoprocesseced maps are presented, in addition to general installing recommendations for the photovoltaic system’s infrastructure.
