 With the increase in the number of patients and activity of hospitals, the issue of hospital waste management (HWM) is becoming more and more challenging and worrying. In addition to financial losses, there will be irreparable damage to the ecosystem and environment which will create many problems for people (because the job of some people in the area is livestock and agriculture and they have a lot to do with their surroundings). It also doubles the need to pay attention to the issue of sustainable development (simultaneous attention to social, economic and environmental dimensions) in waste management. Moreover, the climatic and geographical conditions and lack of proper waste management in this area lead to major problems. Therefore, in this research, by developing a novel multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model, HWM is addressed in the hospitals of Sari, Iran. The aim is to design an HWM network considering sustainability, resiliency and uncertainty. In order to deal with uncertainty, a robust fuzzy programming approach is employed, and then an improved goal programming technique and Lp-metric method is proposed to solve the model. It was revealed that goal programming outperforms the Lp-metric method in terms of all objectives. Furthermore, the obtained results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology to design an efficient sustainable HWM network.
