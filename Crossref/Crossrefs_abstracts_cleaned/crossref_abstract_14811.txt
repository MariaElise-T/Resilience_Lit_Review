In addition to the conventional laboratory tests of input materials and construction mixtures, the technically correct design of pavement structure involves more frequent functional tests of the input materials and mixtures. Our study summarizes findings from a long-term monitoring of pavement on selected road sections with lower traffic intensity. The research involved the comparison of resilient moduli as a design parameter of unbound pavement base layers’ unbound granular materials (UGMs), determined in a laboratory by a test device for a cyclical triaxial test and in situ by impact load test using a falling weight deflectometer (FWD). In particular, the resilient moduli determined in the laboratory by a cyclic triaxial test (Mr,CTT) were compared with the real values of resilient moduli measured by FWD (Mr,FWD). A new, unique, and innovative FWD device was used to determine the Mr,FWD of the UGMs. The innovation lay in the dual-axis deflection measurement—measurement performed not just in the axis parallel to the road, but also in the axis in the transversal direction. It was found that, especially on roads with lower traffic load, such dual-axis (spatial) determination of Mr,FWD moduli was of great importance because it often allowed the identification of local pavement sections with low bearing capacities, especially at the edges, which have a significantly lower value of Mr,FWD.
