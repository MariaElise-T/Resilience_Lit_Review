AbstractThis article reviews the contributions of the Oregon Resiliency Project, an effort to enhance positive social–emotional development of children and youth through social and emotional learning (SEL). The project was launched in 2001 as a collaborative effort between faculty and graduate student researchers at the University of Oregon. The primary aims have included training, outreach, and research in school‐based mental health promotion. One of the major contributions has been the development of the Strong Kids programs, SEL curricula designed to be used by educators and mental health personnel at the pre‐K through Grade 12 level as a brief and low‐cost way to promote SEL. The Strong Kids programs and the process of developing and refining them are described. The yield of several feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness studies are overviewed, as are the lessons learned in conducting this line of work. Additional efforts of the project are discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
