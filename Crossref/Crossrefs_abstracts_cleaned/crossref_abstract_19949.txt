 Burnout and resiliency are significant challenges among health care workers. Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has shown to improve patient-level outcomes; however, AAT research involving hospital staff is limited. Our novel Medical Dog (“MD”) Office Hours Program aimed to provide support to pediatric hospital staff and explore the program’s impact on burnout. Participant surveys described work role and years of experience, well-being, and emotional/physical descriptions and symptoms. Of 149 participants, 85% endorsed baseline distress/burnout; nearly half had at-risk Well-Being Index scores. Compared with baseline, postintervention participants endorsed significantly fewer negative (more positive) emotions; greater feelings of comfort and energy; and decreased tiredness and pain ( P < .0001). Readiness to return to work scores were high (M = 78.1, SD = 18.4). Our Medical Dog (“MD”) Office Hours Program resulted in improvements in emotional descriptions and physical symptoms among pediatric health care staff. Leveraging AAT among health care staff may help mitigate burnout and increase resiliency.
