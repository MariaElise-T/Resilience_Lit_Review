The researchers used the Yaro Yameneâ€™s method to select a sample size of 225 persons. It was concluded in this paper that SMEs should develop resilience drive in their business approaches. The study found that due to dearth of resources and internal capabilities, there is need for SMEs to leverage on the services of management consultants. The p-value shows a 0.001 and 0.002 outputs, which reflects the significant contributions management consultants can make to the development of resilience in SMEs in turbulent times.
