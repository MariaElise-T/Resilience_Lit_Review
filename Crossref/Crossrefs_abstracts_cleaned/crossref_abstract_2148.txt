Abstract
The Covid-19 disaster changed as well as limited students’ learning space in carrying out learning activities at school. The face-to-face learning process was suspended and transformed into an online system. This education emergency demands rapid changes that must be made by all components of education, especially teachers. The enactment of the regulation on limiting the students’ learning activities required teachers as educational facilitators to be ready and alert in changing the educational pattern. This study described the readiness of teachers and the resilience of teacher strategies in carrying out learning during the pandemic in accordance with teacher competency standards in Law Number 14 of 2005. The research data was collected through observation, questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis was performed using descriptive analysis and questionnaire data scoring. The results showed that according to the four teacher competencies, i.e. pedagogic, personality, social, and professional competences, only personality competency was in the good category range, while the other three components according to the average score are in the moderate category range. Therefore, some improvements on the the mitigation and resilience of teachers' strategies when facing emergency disaster are needed.
