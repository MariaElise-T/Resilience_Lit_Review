 Nurses can benefit from strategies that build resilience to counterbalance trauma exposures. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and adverse community environments are common; nurses frequently encounter trauma victims and hear trauma narratives in most care settings. Having skills to manage the triggers present in health-care environments is essential. Contemplative practices can help to meet these needs. Breathing exercises can be used as needed throughout the work day; gratitude practices are simple but powerful; and visual journaling can help nurses process experiences. These practices are easy to implement and can profoundly affect health outcomes for nurses.
