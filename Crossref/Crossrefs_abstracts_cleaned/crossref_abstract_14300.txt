This paper contains transdisciplinary reflections from both scientists and local NGO (nongovernmental organisation) managers on the international small island tourism destination of Gili Trawangan, Indonesia. These viewpoints centre on the impacts of, as well as the short‐ and long‐term adaptation strategies and sustainability opportunities associated with, two disasters that occurred in rapid succession: the earthquakes that struck Lombok in 2018; and the COVID‐19 pandemic that began in 2020. A brief review of the governance challenges facing Gili Trawangan sets up the analysis of the findings and the presentation of new empirical insights into how the island's communities have dealt with two unique disaster scenarios over the past three years. The paper draws on a community resilience framework premised on social capital and collective action theories to position the island's ability to transition towards sustainable tourism in the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic. It concludes by laying out sustainability opportunities going forward.
