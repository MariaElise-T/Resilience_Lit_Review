Abstract
This study attempts to understand the climatic resilience of two forest types of central India—that is, Tectona grandis (Teak) forest of Satpura Tiger Reserve and Shorea robusta (Sal) forest of Kanha Tiger Reserve—using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extracted from MODIS, and climate variable data sets at highest spatial and temporal scales. Teak and Sal forests within the core area of the selected tiger reserves represent the least anthropogenic disturbances, and therefore, the observed changes in NDVI and EVI over the past 16 years could be analyzed in the context of climate change. The correlation analysis between climatic variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, and total annual rainfall) and forest response indicators (NDVI/EVI) at seasonal and annual scales revealed that Teak and Sal forests are more sensitive to change in past temperature as compared with rainfall. Also, the changes in NDVI and EVI of Sal forest are correlated more to minimum temperature, and that of Teak forest to maximum temperature. The analysis of sapling girth class of Sal and Teak further revealed that Sal as compared with Teak is more affected because of the changing climate variables of the recent past. The findings of the study will help manage forests more efficiently in the context of changing climate.
