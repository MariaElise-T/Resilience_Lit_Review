 Objectives: The Trauma Resilience Scale (TRS), assessing protective factors associated with positive adaptation following violence, was tested in three waves of data collection. Empirical and theoretical literature shaped subscale and item formation emphasizing resilience following physical abuse, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and/or a serious threat or injury to life. Methods: Content validation experts helped refine items. The three-factor model, including problem solving, relationships, and optimism, was tested (n = 270). A four-factor model adding spirituality was also tested (n = 307). Results: Both models demonstrated strong reliability, validity, and factor analyses results. However, the four-factor model was best supported by the data. Conclusions: Both global scales and individual factor subscales are supported for clinical and research administrations.
