A pipe segment system has been used to estimate its inherent resilience properties for the variation of mass flow rate, inlet temperature and inlet pressure. Superheated steam is taken as the process fluid. The magnitude of the resilience decreases from 927.8 kJ/m3s to 43 kJ/m3s and 31.5 kJ/m3s for variation of mass flow rate, inlet pressure and inlet temperature respectively. In this work, a novel methodology has been described for quantification of inherent system resilience and resilience magnitude has been found to be highest (927.8 kJ/m3s) in case of variation of mass flow rate through the pipe segment system. A useful correlation T = Ta(1-e-nL)+Tse-nL has been formulated for estimation of process fluid temperature, T at any pipe length, L.
