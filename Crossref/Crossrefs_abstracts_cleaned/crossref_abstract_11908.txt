AbstractNomadTown a resilience hub based on learning for emergency prevention, positive impact creation, and adaptation is presented. The educative background of the sub-culture found there are outlined. A thick description of the educational milieu NomadTown is situated in is given. A contextualization of this milieu is provided with a Foucauldian awareness of the dispositif (apparatus). Whether the social ecology of associations, this resilience hub is becoming embedded in, is a suitable way to make the great transition needed to deal with climate change; and how organizational learning, manifesting as network learning, is taking place are considered. Such functioning connections are embodying the networked village concept of Nahrada’s Global Village Hypothesis. I conclude that working through connected networks, in NomadTown’s educational milieu, is an effective way to make change for resilience in our human survival situation when faced with climate change. However, NomadTown needs better connections to industry and government.
