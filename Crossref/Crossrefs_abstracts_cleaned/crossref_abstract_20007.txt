Teachers are perceived as one of the most important members of our society, however it can be a highly demanding profession. The goal of this study is to serve as a basis into improving the life satisfaction of those in such an important profession, at same time, to determine the relationship between self-reflection, resilience, and life satisfaction in a descriptive correlational study. Active teaching professionals (n=150) in some cities of Metro Manila were gathered, and made to answer the Satisfaction With Life Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Results were tallied, then analyzed, resulting in very high levels of self-reflection (u = 4.45), high levels of resilience (u = 3.31), and also very high levels of life satisfaction (u = 5.18). In terms of correlation, positive correlations were found in both the relationship of self-reflection and resilience (r = 0.242), as well as the relationship of self-reflection and life satisfaction (r = 0.346). However, no correlation was found in resilience and life satisfaction (r = 0.086).
