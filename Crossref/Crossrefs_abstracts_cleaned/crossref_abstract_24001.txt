IntroductionJob rotation is a work organisation strategy used to reduce work-related exposures and musculoskeletal complaints, yet evidence for the efficacy of the approach is weak. Mismatch between job rotation and company needs, lack of full implementation, lack of exposure variation in included tasks and failure to assess variation may underlie inconclusive research findings to date. The study aims to develop a job rotation with company stakeholders, perform a process evaluation of the implementation, and determine the extent to which the intervention improves the physical and psychosocial work environment, indicators of health, gender and social equality among workers and production quality and resilience.Methods and analysisApproximately 60 production workers at a Swedish commercial laundromat will be recruited. Physical and psychosocial work environment conditions, health, productivity and gender and social equality will be assessed pre and post intervention, using surveys, accelerometers, heart rate, electromyography and focus groups. A task-based exposure matrix will be constructed, and exposure variation estimated at the level of the individual worker pre and post intervention. An implementation process evaluation will be conducted. Job rotation efficacy will be assessed in terms of improvement in work environment conditions, health, gender and social inequality, and production quality and resilience. This study will provide novel information on the effects of the job rotation on physical and psychosocial work environment conditions, production quality and rate, health and gender and social inequality among blue-collar workers in a highly multicultural workplace.Ethics and disseminationThe study received approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (reference number 2019-00228). The results of the project will be shared directly with the employees, managers and union representatives from the participating company, other relevant labour market stakeholders and with researchers at national and international conferences and via scientific publication.Trial registration numberThe study is preregistered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zmdc8/).
