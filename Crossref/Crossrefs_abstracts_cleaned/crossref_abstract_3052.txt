Climate resiliency is known as a mitigating factor that helped vegetable farmers survive during the occurrence of natural disasters such as droughts, typhoons, and pest infestations, among others. The Philippines is a tropical country located in the Pacific typhoon belt, making it more vulnerable to natural disasters, specifically from typhoons. One of the salient and effective ways for Filipino farmers to survive is to strengthen their adaptive capacity through government programs and policies that will prepare them during natural calamities to make them less vulnerable to climate change effects and to sustain their productivity and income. This study aims to identify the adaptive capacity of vegetable farmers of Liliw, Laguna. This study examined the factors that affect farmers' adaptive capacity, such as farming experiences, government support, membership in agricultural organizations, and adaptive farming training.  This study used Delphi Technique to gather information from a group of vegetable farmers, agriculture experts, and officers from the Municipal Agriculture and Fishery Council (MAFC), DOST-PCAARRD, and UPLB. The factors that affect the adaptive capacity in relation to the productivity and income of farmers are discussed as well. Using ranking, equal weights, and variable weights techniques and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), three policy alternatives were assessed: (1) establishment of a centralized trading post, (2) improving accessibility and affordability of vegetable seeds, and (3) establishment of a registered farmers’ cooperative. Based on the results of the previously mentioned techniques and CBA, the policy recommendation is the establishment of a registered farmers’ cooperative.
