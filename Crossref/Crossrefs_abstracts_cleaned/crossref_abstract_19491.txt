AbstractThe establishment of prediction model for abrasion properties of vulcanizates, based on their simple physio‐mechanical properties, is a hot research field in tribology. The hardness (H), resilience (R), and dynamic fatigue fracture parameters (m) of rubber vulcanizates were combined together in this article, named as hardness–resilience product (HmR), and its relationships with the abrasion loss for various vulcanizates [natural rubber (NR), styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR), butadiene rubber (BR), and their blends] was investigated by using Akron and DIN abrader. The results showed that, for NR/SBR blends with different SBR content, compared with log(H4R), the abrasion loss had much better linear relationship with log(HmR) for both Akron and DIN abrasion. This good linear relationship, for both Akron and DIN abrasion, also appeared in the SBR/BR blends with different BR content. Furthermore, for both blending systems (NR/SBR and SBR/BR), when all the data above were put together, the abrasion loss also had good linear relationships with its log(HmR) no matter for Akron or DIN abrasion, which indicated that this linear relationship had some universality. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
