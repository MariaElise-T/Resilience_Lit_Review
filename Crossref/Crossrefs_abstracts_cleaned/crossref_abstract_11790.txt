Mental health problems have important implications on various aspects of adolescents' lives including their ability to engage in education, engage in constructive family relationships, and make friends and develop independence. Therefore, detection, treatment and support are fundamental parts of the services to be provided to the adolescent population. The aim of this community service activity is to organize activities that can be used as an effort to improve mental health in teenagers through the Calming Corner Therapy program. The calming corner therapy activity was carried out for 4 weeks, where for 4 weeks there was one meeting a week for 60-80 minutes. Calming Corner Therapy provides a guidance process for various interventions that can be applied independently by teenagers and jointly explore various approaches to find the right combination and solution for teenagers who experience mental health problems. The calculation results show that of the 50 teenagers who took part in the calming corner therapy community service activity in an effort to increase mental resilience in teenagers, 86% had positive resilience and 14% had negative resilience. Calming Corner Therapy is one of the activities that can help students improve the mental resilience of teenagers. Therefore, community service activities in schools need to be developed sustainably.
