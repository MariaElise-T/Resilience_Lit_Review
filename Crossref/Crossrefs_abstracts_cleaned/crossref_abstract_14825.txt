In wireless networks 6LOWPAN with the low power wireless devices has limited processing capabilities. In this network, the malicious node attacks at the network layer due to its nature of self configuration and dynamic network formation. It increased number of packet dropping attacks in network layer like Black Hole attacks and Worm Hole Attacks may cause the undesired operations in the time of routing the packet transfer. It degrades the performance of the legitimate users in the network. This work proposes an Efficient Network Discovery Storage Based Resilient Packet-Forwarding Scheme for the mitigation of malicious black hole and wormhole attacked nodes in 6Lowpan Sensor Networks. It also cooperates to manage the storage and prevent packet drop of sensor nodes present in the 6lowpan network.
