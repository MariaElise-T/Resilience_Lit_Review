Measuring resiliency of smart grid systems is one of the vital topics towards maintaining a reliable and efficient operation under attacks. This paper introduces a set of factors that are utilized for resiliency quantification of microgrid (MG) systems. The level of resilience (LoR) measure is determined by examining the voltage sag percentage, the level of performance reduction (LoPR) as measured by percentage of reduction of load served, recovery time (RT), which is the time system takes to detect and recover from an attack/fault, and the time to reach Power Balance state (Tb) during the islanded mode. As an illustrative example, a comparison based on the resiliency level is presented for two topologies of MGs under an attack scenario.
