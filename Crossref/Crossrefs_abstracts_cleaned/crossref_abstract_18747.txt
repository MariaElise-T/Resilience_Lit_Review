PurposeThis study aims to discover clothing consumption shifts and explore the effect of consumer resilience in changing clothing consumption patterns or establishing new clothing consumption routines after experiencing disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA two-phase multi-method approach was employed. The first phase of qualitative inquiry was conducted to identify clothing consumption shifts using a content mining approach on a text data sample of 17,195 tweets posted from 1 January to 30 September 2020. The second phase of the quantitative study was conducted to explore consumer resilience's effect on clothing consumption shifts based on a collected national sample of 418 respondents through an online survey.FindingsThis study identified clothing consumption changes including value shifts, style shifts and spending shifts. It was also found that resilient consumers care about a company's ethical practices and value the quality instead of the number of items in their wardrobe. Consumers spend more time wearing comfortable clothing and are used to the working-from-home lifestyle.Originality/valueThis study explored approaches to making use of social media data for a better understanding of consumers' clothing behaviour. Also, this study attempted to explore and understand clothing consumption practices during and post the Covid-19 global pandemic, focusing on identifying shifts that might last longer for fashion businesses to explore growth opportunities.
