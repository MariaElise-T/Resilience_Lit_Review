Abstract
This paper presents the effects of using reclaimed asphalt pavements (RAP) materials in asphalt mixture as an alternative solution to overcome the cost of construction and rehabilitation works as well as assessing the resilient modulus characteristic of control and modified mixtures respectively. To achieve this aim, four series of mix portions with 4%, 5%, 6% and 7% Advera® were blended into asphalt binder. Then the modified binder were added into mixture with four series of the mixture replacement with 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% RAP. Resilient modulus test was performed at different mixing temperature (135 °C and 125 °C) and test temperature (25 °C and 40 °C) respectively. Consequently the quadratic model for resilient modulus was established. The optimum of Advera® content was found to be 5%. At 5% Advera content, the resilient modulus of the modified RAP mixture was significantly improved.
