AbstractNatural selection drives the acquisition of organismal resilience traits to protect against adverse environments. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary mechanism for the acquisition of novel traits, including metazoan acquisitions in immunity, metabolic, and reproduction function via interdomain HGT (iHGT) from bacteria. Here, we report that the nematode gene rml‐3 has been acquired by iHGT from bacteria and that it enables exoskeleton resilience and protection against environmental toxins in Caenorhabditis elegans. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that diverse nematode RML‐3 proteins form a single monophyletic clade most similar to bacterial enzymes that biosynthesize L‐rhamnose, a cell‐wall polysaccharide component. C. elegans rml‐3 is highly expressed during larval development and upregulated in developing seam cells upon heat stress and during the stress‐resistant dauer stage. rml‐3 deficiency impairs cuticle integrity, barrier functions, and nematode stress resilience, phenotypes that can be rescued by exogenous L‐rhamnose. We propose that interdomain HGT of an ancient bacterial rml‐3 homolog has enabled L‐rhamnose biosynthesis in nematodes, facilitating cuticle integrity and organismal resilience to environmental stressors during evolution. These findings highlight a remarkable contribution of iHGT on metazoan evolution conferred by the domestication of a bacterial gene.
