The proposal describes a community hub; a site located within the suburban and urban built environment, made up of an arrangement of community-run buildings and facilities. Modern sustainable technologies and building typologies will be promoted and community interaction encouraged. Multiple functions will work in unison, with all members of the surrounding community interfacing with it. Through participation, collaboration and creative contribution, the Resilient Hub will demonstrate in a tangible, real-time way the connection between energy, water, food production, food preparation, food consumption, compost and energy use. The knowledge and practices gained will proliferate in community membersâ€™ daily practices and help to accelerate the uptake of sustainable technology, building construction and use. Involving the community at the design stage will further integrate the relevance of these sustainable methods. All these aspects combine to challenge us to think in a more integrated way about our future neighbourhoods and how all aspects of them are part of an interconnected system.
