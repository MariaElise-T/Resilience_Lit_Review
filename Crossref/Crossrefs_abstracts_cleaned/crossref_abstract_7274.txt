Abstract
Due to structure form of particles and the characteristics of loess, such as high strength and incomplete consolidation, in order to research the influence of structure on compression and resilience characteristics of loess, the compression resilience test for undisturbed soil and remoulded soil and compression resilience recompression test for undisturbed soil is carried out under five kinds of different water content. The results show that: the structure has great influence on the compression and resilience characteristics of loess, especially after or before the structure damage. And the structured yield stress is bigger, resilience characteristics is more and more strong. Moreover, when pre-consolidation pressure is ascertained, the structure must be considered. The research of compression and resilience characteristics of loess lays a foundation for proposing a new method of ascertaining pre-consolidation pressure.
