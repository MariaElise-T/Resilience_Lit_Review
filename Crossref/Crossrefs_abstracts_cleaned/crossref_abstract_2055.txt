A method of measuring the audiofrequency mechanical impedance of resilient materials, such as rubber and felt, while under static load is described. The experimental arrangement consists of an electromagnetic driver made of a magnetic loudspeaker pot and a rigid voice coil which is supported from both above and below, by two disks made of the sample material. The motion of the coil is determined by an electrostatic variable capacity vibration detector patterned on the Van Zelst condenser microphone circuit. The ratio of the input to output voltage is measured both in magnitude and phase. To determine the mechanical impedance, it is required to make voltage and phase measurements as a function of the mass of the moving system. Results obtained on several materials using this technique and also a resonance technique will be given.
