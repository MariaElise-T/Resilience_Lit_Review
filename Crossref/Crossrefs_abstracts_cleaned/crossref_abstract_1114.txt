PurposeThe purpose of the current literature reviews to contribute to the study of organisational resilience. The study intends to understand the role of dynamic capability flow in creating more resilient business communities. The study tries to relate to how continuous learning enables business communities to plan for, respond to and bounce back from disasters.Design/methodology/approachA structured literature review of 38 empirical studies indicates organisational resilience and highlights the dynamic attributes of organisational resilience and the importance of knowledge interactions and information sharing.FindingsContinuous learning results in complex dynamic capability manifested through research and innovations, technological implementations, social learnings and community knowledge sharing. This clearly emphasises the role of dynamic capabilities in fostering disaster resilience in organisations and business communities.Research limitations/implicationsResearch limitations on continuous learning can be cited as to incorporate case study methods related to organisational experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic while also reviewing digital knowledge transfer strategies and influencing factors.Practical implicationsThe study for fostering resilience in the business ecosystem needs to be embedded in the continuous learning process, and it also includes knowledge sharing and collaboration, both externally and internally, for the business community.Social implicationsSocial implications for this study relate to the seamless flow of the knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing process. The dynamic process of organisational and the business community resilience is a key outcome of this knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer process.Originality/valueA conceptual framework was developed from the review, emphasising how dynamic capabilities through continuous learning enhance business community resilience.
