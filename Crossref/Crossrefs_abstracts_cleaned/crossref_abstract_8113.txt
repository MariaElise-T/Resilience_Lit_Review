The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster afflicting the entire world, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to study resilience. In this study, the relationship between resilience and anxiety was examined in healthcare workers at the Central Laboratory of Padjadjaran University in Indonesia. Two questionnaires were used, namely the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) questionnaires. The objective of the study was to determine the correlation between resilience and anxiety in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was a cross sectional study with descriptive methods and data were collected in July 2021. Univariate analyses described the distribution and percentage of each variable, while bivariate analyses explained the correlation relationship using Pearson’s correlation. 47 respondents filled out the questionnaire and 34% reported having severe anxiety. The mean score of the respondents’ resilience was 68.32 ± 12.31. The Pearson’s correlation test showed a significant relationship between anxiety and resilience (p < 0.013). Resilience is associated with better mental health and can provide a protective effect against anxiety and depression. Resilience can be supported through experience, learning, and formal training.
