Purpose: This study aimed to assess exposure to traumatic events, knowledge and attitudes concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the level of resilience among nurses and paramedics working in emergency departments. Methods: Data were collected from May 22 to June 12, 2022, using a self-administered survey questionnaire. The participants comprised 135 nurses and 80 paramedics working in emergency departments. The collected data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, a t-test, and an analysis of variance with Scheffé’s test. Results: Compared with emergency room nurses, paramedics were more positive about the government’s spending on job opportunities for people with PTSD. There were no significant differences in attitude regarding government strategies and people with PTSD between nurses and paramedics. Paramedics had higher scores on the effective treatment for PTSD, while emergency room nurses showed higher scores on effective psychotherapy. General knowledge of PTSD differed according to sex (t=-2.33, <i>p</i>=.021) and education level (F=3.21, <i>p</i>=.042). Resilience scores differed significantly according to sex (t=2.02, <i>p</i>=.045), education level (F=4.10, <i>p</i>=.018), self-reported economic state (F=10.34, <i>p</i><.001), and self-reported health (F=11.57, <i>p</i><.001). Conclusion: The findings support that emergency department nurses and paramedics are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health and indicate that intervention programs should be developed to enhance resilience in emergency department professionals.
