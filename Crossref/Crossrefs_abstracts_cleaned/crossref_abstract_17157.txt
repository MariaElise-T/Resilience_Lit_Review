Abstract

Objective: Family plays an important role in taking care of children with intellectual disabilities (IDs). Resilience supports coping strategies for caregivers with their children caring. However, factors influencing the resilience of caregivers with ID in Thailand are yet to be identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the predictors of resilience in caregivers of children with moderate to severe ID.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was implemented in caregivers of children with ID aged 18 years and older who had children diagnosed with ID aged 6–18 years and classified as moderate to severe ID. Descriptive statistic and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis.

Results: The study sample consisted of 85 caregivers who took care of their children older than 5 years (95.30%). Depression, social support, cognitive function, and stigma could predict the resilience (F [4, 80] = 26.79, P < 0.001) and explain the variability of resilience by 57.3%.

Conclusions: Caregivers have to take care of their children for a long period, which could develop a burden to the caregivers. The resilience and influencing factors should be monitored and managed by developing a campaign to promote caregivers’ health and well-being.
