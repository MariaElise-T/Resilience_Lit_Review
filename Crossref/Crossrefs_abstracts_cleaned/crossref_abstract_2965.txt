The paper uses bibliometric methods to explore the production of knowledge in the field of climate change from 1991â€“2019. Using the Web of Science database, we demonstrate the growth of publications in the field, including papers in mitigation, adaptation and resilience. Using VOSviewer software, we show the connections between these subfields and the journals in which they are published. The analysis displays clusters of publications in different subfields and minimal convergence of research in STEM fields and the social sciences. We suggest that this lack of convergence may reflect a relative shortage of interdisciplinary research which may in turn have negative outcomes in terms of research and policy.
