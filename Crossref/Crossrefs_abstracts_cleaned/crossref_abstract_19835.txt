Research regarding family adaption and resilience in children with chronic health conditions has resulted in the development of a number of theoretical models and data‚Äêdriven psychosocial interventions in the field of pediatric psychology, some of which may not be well known in the field of family science. These models incorporate family systems theory and multiple resiliency factors within their framework to better describe the complex process of adaptation and subsequent adjustment outcomes. In this article, three contemporary resilience models within pediatric psychology are briefly reviewed and discussed. The development of a psychosocial intervention targeting uncertainty management for caregivers of children with cancer and the preliminary results are also presented as an exemplar of how such models may utilized to build interventions. Finally, the implications of the authors' findings and future research directions involving psychosocial interventions for families of children with chronic health conditions are discussed.
