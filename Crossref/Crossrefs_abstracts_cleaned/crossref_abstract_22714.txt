Student internship model of the Resilience Academy is designed to work with the local organisations to conduct geospatial data collection campaigns based on the use of various open-source data and tools combined with community mapping and digital online working. Simultaneously, students’ exposure to practical training during the internship provides them with relevant applied geospatial skills, which increase their future employment opportunities and participation in informed decision-making.
