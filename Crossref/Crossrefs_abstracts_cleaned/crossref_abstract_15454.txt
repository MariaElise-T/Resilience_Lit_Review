AbstractWe address the interrelatedness of resilience across levels by proposing a series of cross窶人evel effects between individual and team resilience. First, we present a homologous model of resilience including four core components that transcend levels of analysis: (1) the occurrence of adversity, (2) the capacity for resilience (3) the enactment of resilience, and (4) the demonstration of resilience. Second, building on a multilevel perspective and existing theory (e.g., conservation of resources and role theory), we present five foundational principles for understanding cross窶人evel resilience effects: (1) resilience components are interrelated across levels; (2) resilience capacity resources are finite and subject to depletion; (3) resources can be derived from and applied to individual or team levels; (4) effectively enacting resilience requires alignment between resources and situational demands; and (5) resilience processes can conflict across levels. Finally, we present a series of propositions that elucidate potential cross窶人evel effects between components of individual and team resilience, including those with positive, null, and negative consequences. This work advances the resilience literature by offering an integrated, cross窶人evel perspective concerning the ways in which individual and team resilience are likely interrelated.
