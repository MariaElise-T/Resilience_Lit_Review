"The complexity of the urban environment causes a continuous change in the different variables of vulnerability: social, economic and environmental protection, energy, health, water, traffic, climate and security- in connection with sustainable development. Multi-hazard and multi-risk assessment for urban areas, in the context of territorial planning policies, is a priority for increasing the resilience of local communities. Vulnerability, as a factor in risk analysis, can influence the likelihood of negative consequences for man, the environment, and infrastructure. A detailed analysis of the vulnerability indicators in the area of industrial hazard sources can improve the correctness of the decisions in the territorial planning process. The paper presents the analysis of the influence of vulnerability, through the presented factors, in the technological risk assessment of major industrial accidents involving hazardous substances. "
