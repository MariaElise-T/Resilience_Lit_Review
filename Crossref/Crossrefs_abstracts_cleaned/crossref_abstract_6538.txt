This paper aims to compare the structuralist and phenomenological approaches to psychosocial risk and propose an integration of those two perspectives. The first section defines the concepts of risk, vulnerability, protection, and resilience from a structuralist perspective. The second section describes the concepts of experience of vulnerability and experience of resilience from a phenomenological perspective. The last section proposes a comprehensive model of intervention for at-risk families.
