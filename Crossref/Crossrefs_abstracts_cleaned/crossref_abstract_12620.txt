 Introduction Increased resilience has been consistently linked to improved mental and physical health outcomes. Because individuals with HIV have a longer life expectancy than ever before, it is imperative to identify mechanisms to promote resilience in this population. Physical activity has significant potential to strengthen resilience and improve overall well-being in individuals with HIV. The goal of this study was to investigate whether increased physical activity is positively associated with increased individual-level psychosocial resilience, and whether this association varied by HIV status.   Methods Data for this analysis were obtained from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longitudinal observational cohort study following men living with and without HIV in the United States. Specifically, cross-sectional data collected between October 2016 and March 2017 from 1118 MACS participants enrolled in the Understanding Patterns of Healthy Aging Among Men Who Have Sex With Men sub-study were used. Odds ratios were determined using logistic regression to examine the association of physical activity with psychosocial resilience (measured using the 14-item Resilience Scale).   Results Among all MACS participants enrolled in the sub-study, both sufficient physical activity and health-enhancing physical activity were positively associated with high resiliency (odds ratio, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.36-3.56] and odds ratio, 3.72 [95% CI, 2.30-6.03], respectively). Among the participants with HIV, only health-enhancing physical activity was positively associated with high resiliency (odds ratio, 3.07 [95% CI, 1.54-6.14]).   Conclusions At the level of individual patient care, physical activity has significant potential to improve health outcomes and strengthen resilience in individuals living with HIV.
