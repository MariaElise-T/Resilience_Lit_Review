ObjectivesRecent surveys have paid insufficient attention to the psychological status of medical residents, but medical residents, as a special group of medical workers, need to be focused on. This study aimed to investigate medical residents' levels of social support, psychological resilience, and coping style, and explore the mediating role of psychological resilience, which can ultimately provide a new theoretical basis for improving medical residents' psychological status and quality of work and life.MethodsA total of 577 medical residents from China were investigated by an online questionnaire, using convenience sampling. Associations between social support, psychological resilience, and coping styles were assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. The mediating effect of psychological resilience was tested using SPSS Process.ResultsPositive correlations between social support, psychological resilience and coping style were found (r = 0.474, P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.473, P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.353, P &lt; 0.001). The mediating effect of psychological resilience in the relationship between social support and coping style was significant (95% CI: 0.168, 0.384), and accounted for 25.84%.ConclusionAttention should be paid to the psychological status of medical residents, and social support and psychological flexibility can be used to increase the enthusiasm for their coping style and promote their mental health.
