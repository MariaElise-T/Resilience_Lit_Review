(1) Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative for higher education institutions to understand the socio-psychological issues of international students, a potentially vulnerable population on campuses, to assist them in pursuing their academic path while maintaining their psychological well-being. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of academic burnout among international university students in Taiwan during the new normal and to explore the protective role of academic resilience. (2) Methods: Three hundred and eighty-three international university students in Taiwan were recruited and surveyed via the online self-administered questionnaire during the Fall semester of the 2022â€“2023 academic year. The data of sociodemographic characteristics, academic burnout, and academic resilience were collected and analyzed. (3) Results: The overall prevalence of high academic burnout was 12.01%. The majority of participants perceived significant depression and anxiety (detrimental factors) but moderate to high perception of academics and relationships (protective factors). There were significant relationships between resilience components and burnout symptoms. (4) Conclusions: Resilience may help to reduce burnout among international university students during the post-COVID-19 new normal, thereby protecting their mental health.
