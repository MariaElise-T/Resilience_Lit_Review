AbstractInterdependent critical infrastructures are governed by several sectors working together to maintain social, economic, and environmental well‐being. Although many models focus on a centralized view for networks for the restoration planning of these networks, rarely is there only one decision maker for the infrastructure networks. In the decentralized decision‐making paradigm, individual decision makers need to decide how to prioritize areas of the network and eventually improve the aggregated infrastructure systems resilience. There is a dearth of quantitative studies analyzing resource allocation decisions considering both decentralized and cooperative aspects. This paper aims to propose a coalitional game theory approach to address decentralized resource allocation for interdependent water distribution and road networks. In particular, combining coalitional game theory with weighted graphs creates an order of repair for each node in the coalitions. Subsequently, the decision makers can pass the information on to the master problem, reducing the complexity of the resource allocation problem for the interdependent networks. The proposed approach is applied to water distribution and transportation networks in the City of Tampa, Florida. We compare the decentralized solutions to centralized solutions in different scenarios to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for the city‐scale networks. The results indicated the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of computational time and solution quality.
