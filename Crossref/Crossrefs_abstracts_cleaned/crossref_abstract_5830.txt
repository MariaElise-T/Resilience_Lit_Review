Abstract
Incorporating the theory of resilience into land remediation is an inevitable requirement of the development of the times. This paper explores the combination and application of resilience theory in land remediation projects through literature analysis and logical reasoning, and proposes the planning and design of land remediation. Relying on the theory of resilience, we should explore the theory of resilience and the direction of land rectification under the development of the times.
