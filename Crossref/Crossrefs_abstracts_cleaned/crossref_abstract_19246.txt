Abstract
Building family resilience could be done by improving the quality of the family through group activities in the community environment. One of group activities in Minang society is called batobo. Batobo is one of activities of farmer groups in society that may have an impact on family resilience in, such as, economic, social and psychological aspects. This study aimed at seeing cultural values of batobo in building family's social resilience. A qualitative approach with descriptive phenomenology was used as a research methodology. Data were collected through group interviews to 2 batobo groups and in-depth interviews to 3 community leaders selected through purposive sampling technique. Furthermore, the data were analyzed qualitatively using Nvivo 10.0 software. The results showed that batobo cultural values obtained in building family's social resilience were; (i) social independence, (ii) strengthening contributions to the family, (iii) equality of life, and (iv) having open communication. The results of this study illustrated that the culture of batobo in Minang society could be used as an alternative to build family social resilience in the midst of society that had been starting to live individually.
