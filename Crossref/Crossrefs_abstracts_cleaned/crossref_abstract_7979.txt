AimThe aim of this study was to identify the effects of daily stress and resilience on successful ageing among community‐dwelling older adults.BackgroundAgeing can be a positive experience if there is good adaptation to ageing processes. Positive ageing needs to be a basis of nursing care, health promotion and education within community settings.MethodsData were collected in March and April of 2014 from 262 older adults living in Seoul and Jeju, South Korea. We used a four‐part survey consisting of demographic data, daily stress, resilience and successful ageing scales, in total 91 items. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t‐test, one‐way ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to identify the influence of variables on successful ageing.FindingsSuccessful ageing had a significant negative correlation with daily stress and a positive correlation with resilience. Daily stress had a negative correlation with resilience. Findings of hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that resilience and subjective economic status had an effect on successful ageing. Furthermore, these variables accounted for 41.6% of the variance in successful ageing.LimitationsData were collected in only two cities of Korea based on convenience sampling.ConclusionThe findings of the study suggest that daily stress and resilience have a statistically significant relationship with successful ageing. Furthermore, resilience is an important influential factor and a much‐needed personal characteristic for one's successful ageing.Implications for nursing and health policiesNurses can advocate joining with health and social policy makers to implement policies on healthy ageing, including evaluation of stress, education programmes and implementation of self‐help groups to enhance resilience in older people.
