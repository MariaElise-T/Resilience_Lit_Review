 In a multi-institutional National Science Foundation artificial intelligence grant application, we generated ideas for an institute that can leverage intelligent agents for cybersecurity. My own role, as co-principal investigator, concerned communication involving risk, safety, ethics, and inclusion (broadly diversity, equity, inclusion, and accountability, or DEIA) based on my resilience scholarship and prior National Science Foundation funding in ethical development, ethical design, and professional formation of engineers. This essay does not present the grant itself (that is being revised for resubmission), but outlines some considerations with regard to risk, resilience, and ethics in artificial intelligence.
