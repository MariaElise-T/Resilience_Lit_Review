 The proposed model in this article seeks to extend the job search literature by considering resiliency as a predictor of job search behavior and reemployment outcomes. In addition, because past research in this area has not expressly considered job search skills, they are included in this model as an additional predictor along with their interaction with resiliency. The importance of resiliency for job seekers is discussed with particular emphasis on young adults, minorities, and relocating spouses/partners. Because resiliency is a state-like variable, suggestions are offered to promote the development of resiliency in job seekers. It is hoped that the theoretical framework proposed in this article and the specific recommendations for resiliency development can positively affect job seekers pursuing reemployment.
