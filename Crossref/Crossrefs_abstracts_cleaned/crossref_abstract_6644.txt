Research on learning style models advocate that students are more likely to achieve learning goals by matching teaching styles with learning styles. This paper investigates students’ learning styles by the Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ) as it conveys the opportunity to build resiliency among students.  The nature of resiliency has also been explored using multiple measurements. The paper’s investigation includes a short scale of measuring resiliency used by post-compulsory researchers. Students learning styles were examined in terms of ethnicity and gender and their relationship with course types and resilience. A research study in London asked thirty students (15 males and 15 females) to complete the LSQ and measurement of resilience items.  The results showed that students’ learning style was not related to ethnicity, gender, qualification type, or resilience. These findings support some research. The research implies that triangulation of measurements is necessary with a larger number of participants across types of courses and locations. Furthermore, students’ resilience needs to be defined in terms of wellbeing, gender, and ethnicity across the U.K.
