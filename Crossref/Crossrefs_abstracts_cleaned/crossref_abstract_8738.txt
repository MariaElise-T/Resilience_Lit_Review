Based on the theoretical model of resilience devised by Guajardo (2011), this study aims to understand the adverse contexts and resilient responses of Brazilian women during the pregnancy-puerperium period when living in Portugal.  Analyzing the interviews allowed us to understand the participants’ resilient movements. These movements were related to two categories: Self-interaction and Social skills. It was possible to verify a process of negotiating with themselves, with people closest to them, and/or with strangers. Thus developing alternatives and possibilities of overcoming the several challenges presented by a process of pregnancy and puerperium in another country. The construction and maintenance of bonds in the form of a support network were referenced by the women as an aspect that enabled self-efficiency, autonomy, and, consequently, resilient responses. Therefore, it was observed that these Brazilian women living in Portugal access resources to overcome the pregnancy-puerperium moment experienced within a migratory context.
