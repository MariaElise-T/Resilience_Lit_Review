 Objective: The study examines psychological well-being and self-concept in college students diagnosed with ADHD. Method: We surveyed 17 undergraduate college students with ADHD and 19 undergraduate controls concerning academic and emotional support received from family and friends. All students completed the Connor’s Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II), Connor’s Adult Rating Scale (CAARS), Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS:2) and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB). Results: Between group differences were significant for the CAARS and CPT-II, but not total self-concept (TSC) or global PWB. The strongest predictors for TSC were e nvironmental mastery (PWB) for the ADHD group and positive relations with others (PWB) for the controls. Students with ADHD reported significantly higher paternal support than controls who reported significantly greater support from friends. Conclusion: College students with a diagnosis of ADHD may represent an especially resilient group. Future studies should investigate competencies of students with ADHD who have achieved success against the odds.
