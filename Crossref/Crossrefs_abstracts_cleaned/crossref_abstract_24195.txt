Abstract
Resilience is an important indicator for measuring regional sustainable development capacity. The construction of a suitable evaluation indicator system is the premise of evaluating regional sustainable development. In this study, taking the Jiansanjiang Administration of Heilongjiang Province in China as an example, a preliminary selection library of the evaluation indicator system for the resilience of a regional agricultural soilâ€“water resource composite system covering seven subsystems and 59 indicators was established. Selection criteria such as the Dale indicator criteria, subjective and objective combination weighting and principal component analysis were introduced to construct an optimization model for the resilience evaluation indicator system for the ASWRS. First, 14 indicators that were incomplete or incapable were removed. Then, the Dale indicator selection criteria were used to ensure that 14 indicators were selected. The binary fuzzy comparison method and criteria importance through interference correlation method were used to calculate the combination weight. Finally, an indicator system optimization model was established. The indicator system was optimized from 59 to 35 indicators, and the completeness of the indicator system reached 85.75%. The proposed method had obvious advantages in terms of indicator identification and elimination, and it may truly achieve the goal of indicator optimization.
