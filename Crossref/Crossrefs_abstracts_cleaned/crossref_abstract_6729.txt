This keynote address will focus on the potential to reduce the increasing gap between rich and poor countries. This critical gap only can be bridged if we systematically replace the expensive and reactive international disaster post-hoc operations by systematic, long-term, proactive efforts to increase the local capacity to master everyday accidents and emergencies as well as empower the local preparedness for major events such as natural and technological events. If we really wish to strengthen local preparedness and competencies in remote communities in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC, “the South”), we must systematically share knowledge and skills through scientifically proven training programs aimed at such impoverished, still densely populated regions in the South. Such local training represents a sustainable, long-term action to build emergency medical capacity into the local population and the health workers, as opposed to only relying on expensive foreign relief that arrive too late, is cost ineffective, and most often responds to spectacular disasters. Building local competence also strengthens local resilience (Table 1).
