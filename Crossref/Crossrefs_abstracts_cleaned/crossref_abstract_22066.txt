Areca catechu L. is a commercially important palm tree widely cultured in tropical and subtropical areas. Its growth and production are severely hindered by the increasing threat of drought. In the present study, we investigated the physiological responses of areca seedlings to drought stress. The results showed that prolonged drought-induced yellowing on the overall area of most leaves significantly altered the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, including maximum chemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), photochemical efficiency of PSII (Y(II)), photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (qP) and non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (NPQ). On the 10th day of drought treatment, the contents of proline in the areca leaves and roots increased, respectively, by 12.2 times and 8.4 times compared to normal watering. The trigonelline levels in the leaves rose from 695.35 µg/g to 1125.21 µg/g under 10 days of water shortage, while no significant changes were detected in the content of trigonelline in the roots. We determined the gene encoding areca trigonelline synthase (AcTS) by conducting a bioinformatic search of the areca genome database. Sequence analysis revealed that AcTS is highly homologous to the trigonelline synthases in Coffea arabica (CaTS 1 and CaTS 2) and all possess a conserved S-adenosyl- L-methionine binding motif. The overexpression of AcTS in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that AcTS is responsible for the generation of trigonelline in transgenic Arabidopsis, which in turn improves the drought resilience of transgenic Arabidopsis. This finding enriches our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism of the response of areca to water shortage and provides a foundation for improving the drought tolerance of areca seedlings.
