Resilience can be changed and modified over time, it is affected by many different situations
and difficulties that a person overcomes during life. Resilience is a newer concept, which should
be applied to the patient from the beginning of life with cancer. Clinicians should invest more
time and effort in creating interventions that enable patients to foster their resilience.
The term resilience or the ability to recover refers to the process of overcoming adverse events,
including stress, trauma and illness. Considering the ability to recover as a personality trait
imposes the assumption that the ability to recover represents a constellation of personal
characteristics that enable individuals to adapt to different circumstances they encounter.
Resilience as a complex phenomenon changes over time and circumstances. Understanding
resilience as a complex, multidimensional and dynamic process is very important for
understanding therapeutic mechanisms and healing mechanisms. Psychological factors are the
most important factors that contribute to the development of resilience. It is necessary to work
on the development of psychosocial interventions that will target the psychological resilience
of cancer patients. Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in women. In women
with breast cancer who manage to develop the ability to resist and accept life's crisis, greater
resilience and personal growth is created, thereby reducing the negative impact associated with
the disease. The aim of this work is to explain the relationship between resilience and breast
cancer.
