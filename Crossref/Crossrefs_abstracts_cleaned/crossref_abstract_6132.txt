The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of social support and social connectedness between hope and resilience in adolescents. A total of 413 high school students (57.1% girls; M= 17.31, SD= 1.61) participated in the study. Participants completed the Childrenâ€™s Hope Scale (CHS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Brief Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (BPSSQ), and Social Connectedness Scale (SCS). The results showed that there was a positive significant correlation between social support, resilience, social connectedness, and hope. In addition, according to the gender variable, it is seen that the resilience and hope scores of the boys are significantly higher than the girls. On the other hand, no significant difference was found in social connectedness and social support in terms of gender. The results mediation analysis showed that hope significantly and positively predicted social connectedness, social support, and resilience. Also, social connectedness positively and significantly predicted social support, and social support was a significant predictor of resilience. Most importantly, social support and social connectedness acted as mediating roles in the relationship between hope and resilience. These results suggest that social connectedness and social support are two important sources in developing resilience. This has important implications for research and practice.
