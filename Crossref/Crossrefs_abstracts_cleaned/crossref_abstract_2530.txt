This paper explores how strength-based approaches and restorative practices can foster resilience from patriarchal masculinities in Latin American adolescent boys. Gender violence from the perspective of critical theory will be described. The need for community engagement and critical pedagogy approaches are explored in the context of Latin America. A case study will be developed and analyzed about a specific experience with an allboys Costa Rican high school where efforts for a restorative initiative were unsuccessful. Implications for practitioners are developed through the description of intervention models from both resilience focused approaches and restorative practices.
