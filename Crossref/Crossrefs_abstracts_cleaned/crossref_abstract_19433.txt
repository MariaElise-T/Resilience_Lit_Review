Multi-hazard evaluations are fundamental inputs for disaster risk management plans and the implementation of resilient urban environments, adapted to extreme natural events. Risk assessments from natural hazards have been typically restricted to the analysis of single hazards or focused on the vulnerability of specific targets, which might result in an underestimation of the risk level. This study presents a practical and effective methodology applied to two Chilean coastal cities to characterize risk in data-poor regions, which integrates multi-hazard and multi-vulnerability analyses through physically-based models and easily accessible data. A matrix approach was used to cross the degree of exposure to floods, landslides, tsunamis, and earthquakes hazards, and two dimensions of vulnerability (physical, socio-economical). This information is used to provide the guidelines to lead the development of resilience thinking and disaster risk management in Chile years after the major and destructive 2010 Mw8.8 earthquake.
