IntroductionSemi-natural dry grasslands are among the species-richest and most diverse habitats in Europe especially in the Mediterranean Basin. They evolved with long-term severe environmental constraints, either biotic (e.g., grazing or mowing) or abiotic (e.g., dryness or oligotrophy). Their recovery after sever anthropogenic disturbance, such as cultivation is often very slow and incomplete. A deeper understanding of the processes driving the recovery would be of great benefit to better restore or conserve these grasslands. We used the filter model as a framework to assess the relative importance of dispersion, abiotic and biotic filters as drivers of this recovery.MethodsWe studied the medium-term dynamics of 37 Mediterranean dry grassland plant communities after an episode of cultivation in the plain of La Crau (Southern France) by two census: after 25 years of abandonment, and revisited 10 years later (35 years of abandonment). Our aims were to characterize the temporal medium-term dynamics of these communities, to measure their taxonomic resilience and to identify the drivers. We performed structural equation modeling to measure the importance of the various drivers, with cover of remnant dry grasslands surrounding each studied community as a proxy for the dispersion filter, soil pH and phosphorus content as proxies for the abiotic filter and cover of the most dominant species as a proxy for the biotic filter.Results and DiscussionOur results show that former arable field vegetation do not recover after more than 40 years. The three filters drive the recovery of dry grassland vegetation: former arable fields that have lower phosphorus content (abiotic filter) have a lower cover of dominant species (biotic filter), a higher species richness and a higher similarity with remnant dry grassland plant communities, especially if the former arable fields are surrounded by remnant dry grasslands (dispersion filter).
