The article presents the data of neuropsychological research in the framework of a comprehensive study of the resilience of the youth population (secondary school graduates) of the region of ecological trouble – Zabajkal‘skij kraj. The authors consider resilience as a systemic characteristic of the system ‘man–life environment’. The model of resilience including psychophysiological, psychological and personal levels is offered. Standardized psychometric and neuropsychological methods are used to evaluate level’s indicators. School graduates residing in ecologically unfavorable territories identified drift of psychophysiological level in the direction of lower standards and regulatory intensity indicators of psychological and personal levels ofresilience. Using a neuropsychological approach with the aim of finding mechanisms to a reduction of the indicators of the psycho-physiological level of resilience allowed us to determine the presence of signs of deficiency of certain brain areas (posterior frontal and parietal). It was established that with the increase of degree of the ecology trouble territories of research, there is a reliable increase of mistakes ofaccomplishment by test subjects who live on them, the neuropsychological tests investigating visually spatial functions, and also functions of the serial organization of mental activity. Though there is the presence of correlations between indicators of different levels of resilience, but the rating and the explanation by virtue of their disparate data is difficult. The search for correlates, in this case, can be more aimed at proving the possibility of the existence of the proposed model of resilience, its consistency and productivity of the instruments that are used for its study.
