The purpose of this study was to measure the career resilience of youth with a migrant background by the types of migration and to provide basic data for the career education of migrant youth. For this, the researchers recruited 58 teachers and experts that have experience in teaching non-migrant students and migrant students and conducted questionnaires to derive results. The results are as follows: First, the level of component factors and sub-variables of career resilience were significantly lower in the order of non-migrant youth, native-born youth with a migrant background, and immigrant youth. Second, the differences were most pronounced between youth with a migrant background and youth without a migrant background. Also, differences were found between native-born youth with a migrant background and youth without a migrant background. The study results suggest that in future career education, there is a need for an approach that considers the differences in characteristics between youth without a migrant background and youth with a migrant background as well as the differences in characteristics among various types of migrant background youth.
