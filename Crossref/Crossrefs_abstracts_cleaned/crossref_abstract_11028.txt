A pandemic breaks out and spreads to the geographies and regions of the entire world. Increased infections force governments to bring in lockdowns locking almost every activity. The restrictions are put on the movement of humans and goods. Supply lines are badly affected. The demands are not met due to disrupted supply chains at the beginning of such a breakout. And, consumer demand gets badly affected as we move through uncertain times while fighting and overcoming such unfortunate times. This paper examines the relevance of business resilience and management outlooks for ensuring sustainable business models coupled with community-oriented service models.
