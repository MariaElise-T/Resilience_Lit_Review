Abstract
The encounter of oocyte and sperm is the key event initiating embryonic development in mammals. Crucial functions of this existential interaction are determined by proteolytic enzymes, such as acrosin, carried in the sperm head acrosome, and ovastacin, stored in the oocyte cortical granules. Ovastacin is released upon fertilisation to cleave the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte. This limited proteolysis hardens the oocyte envelope, and thereby provides a definitive block against polyspermy and protects the developing embryo. On the other hand, acrosin, the renowned and most abundant acrosomal protease, has been thought to enable sperm to penetrate the oocyte envelope. Depending on the species, proteolytic cleavage of the zona pellucida by acrosin is either essential or conducive for fertilisation. However, the specific target cleavage sites and the resulting physiological consequences of this proteolysis remained obscure. Here, we treated native mouse zonae pellucidae with active acrosin and identified two cleavage sites in zona pellucida protein 1 (ZP1), five in ZP2 and one in ZP3 by mass spectrometry. Several of these sites are highly conserved in mammals. Remarkably, limited proteolysis by acrosin leads to zona pellucida remodelling rather than degradation. Thus, acrosin affects both sperm binding and mechanical resilience of the zona pellucida, as assessed by microscopy and nanoindentation measurements, respectively. Furthermore, we ascertained potential regulatory effects of acrosin, via activation of latent pro-ovastacin and inactivation of fetuin-B, a tight binding inhibitor of ovastacin. These results offer novel insights into the complex proteolytic network modifying the extracellular matrix of the mouse oocyte, which might apply also to other species.
