AbstractAs climate change increases abiotic stresses like drought and heat, evaluating barley performance under such conditions is critical for maintaining productivity. To assess how barley performs under normal conditions, drought, and heat stress, 29 different varieties were examined, considering agronomic, physiological, and disease-related characteristics. The research was conducted in five environments: two normal environments in 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, two drought stress environments in 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, and one heat stress environment in 2021/2022. The results demonstrated that genotype and environment significantly influenced all traits (p < 0.05), except canopy temperature, while genotype x environment interaction significantly influenced most traits, except total chlorophyll content and canopy temperature. Heat and drought stress environments often resulted in reduced performance for traits like plant height, spike length, grains per spike, and 100-grain weight compared to normal conditions. Based on individual traits, genotypes 07UT-44, 06WA-77, 08AB-09, and 07N6-57 exhibited the highest grain yield (4.1, 3.6, 3.6, and 3.6 t/ha, respectively). Also, these genotypes demonstrated enhanced stability in diverse drought and heat stress conditions, as assessed by the mean performance vs. stability index (Weighted Average of Absolute Scores, WAASB). The multi-trait stability index (MTSI) identified 07UT-44, 07UT-55, 07UT-71, and 08AB-09 as the most stable genotypes in terms of the performance of all traits. The imported lines demonstrated superior performance and stability, highlighting their potential as valuable genetic resources for developing climate-resilient barley.
