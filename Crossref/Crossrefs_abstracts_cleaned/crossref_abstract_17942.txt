AbstractAfter the increasing climate change and fast urbanization adverse effects on pluvial floods, in addition to the freshwater resourcesâ€™ shortage risk, transversal urban solutions need to be tackled. This paper focuses on how the evolutionary urban resilience practices (along with the nature-based solutions and climate change adaptation) work as an integrated approach to enhance multifunctionality levels of sustainable urban planning and design. This integration eventually leads to more pluvial flood-resilient cities and more sustainable urban water resources simultaneously. After thoroughly analyzing related literature and best practices using descriptional, comparative, and statistical approaches, a proposed risk reduction framework that facilitates the resilience operationalizing process was formulated. The proposed framework introduces a design equation that measures the relationship between sustainability and urban resilience sectors. In addition to that, prioritized strategies for enhancing flood resilience and urban wastewater management within the Egyptian local scale were ranked for future applications.
