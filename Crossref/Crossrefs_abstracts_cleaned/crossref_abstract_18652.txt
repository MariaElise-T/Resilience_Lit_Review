AbstractPurposeThis study aimed to determine posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience and understand the relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience in frontline nurses.MethodsThis study was conducted on 263 nurses working at the pandemic clinics of a hospital of a healthcare group in Istanbul and a public hospital in Bursa between June 20 and September 01, 2020. Data were collected online to avoid the risk of infection using the personal information form, the Connor–Davidson resilience scale and the posttraumatic growth inventory.FindingsThere is a significant relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychological resilience in frontline nurses. Nurses with a master's degree have higher psychological resilience than those with a bachelor's degree. Also, those who are reported that they receive organizational support from the nursing services management have higher psychological resilience and posttraumatic growth scores. Participants who worked for the hospital in Istanbul, those who stayed at hotels, and those who had no communication problems with the healthcare team had statistically significant higher posttraumatic scores and subscale scores than others. Also, those who do not think that they can protect themselves from the virus enough have lower posttraumatic growth than those who think so.ConclusionsPsychological resilience was positively correlated with posttraumatic growth and its subscales.Implications for nursing practiceFuture studies should follow up on frontline nurses to determine the long‐term impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on psychological resilience and posttraumatic growth.
