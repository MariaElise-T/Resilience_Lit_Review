IntroductionSince the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus, healthcare workers found themselves on the front lines of an unprecedented battle. Being characterized by adversity, this experience represents a fertile ground for the study of resilience.ObjectivesOur study aims to clarify the phenomenon of resilience through its influence on perceived stress level and its connection with coping strategies.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted involving 254 healthcare professionals in the region of Sousse during the pandemic. In addition to socio-demographic and professional characteristics, Resilience, perceived stress, and coping strategies were assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the PSS10 scale, and the Brief Cope questionnaire, respectively.ResultsThe overall mean [±standard deviation (SD)] age of the participants was 32.9 ± 8.76 years with a sex ratio (M / F) of 0.51. The assessment of resilience among participants revealed a mean score of 64.99 ± 14.72. The majority of participants evinced a score> 50 (82.68%) and 39.76% had a score >70. Our results revealed that, on the one hand, problem-focused coping strategies were positive predictors of resilience (p<10-3), accounting for 3.6% of its variance. On the other hand, coping strategies (problem-focused strategies and avoidance strategies) are also an integral part of the process by which resilience significantly influences the level of perceived stress (mediating factor).ConclusionsDespite its complexity, the relationship between resilience and coping strategies is undeniable and it is a part of an important line of intervention opening the way to better identifications and care.DisclosureNo significant relationships.
