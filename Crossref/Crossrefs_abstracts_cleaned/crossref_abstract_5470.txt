AbstractInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) is vital for the operation of modern power systems, giving rise to Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (CPESs). ICT enables the grid services (GSs) needed for monitoring and controlling the physical parameters of the power system, especially for remedying the impact of disturbances. But the ICT integration makes the overall system more complex, leading to new and unforeseen disturbances. This motivates the need for a resilient system design capable of absorbing and recovering from such disturbances. The current state of the art lacks a comprehensive resilience assessment of ICT-enabled GSs in CPESs. To address this, a novel method and metrics to assess the resilience of GSs in CPESs are presented in this paper. An operational state model of a GS, with three states, i.e., normal, limited and failed, is used to capture its performance, which is essential for quantifying its resilience. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations are performed with the model to capture the behaviour of ICT components to compute the operational state trajectory of the GSs. Metrics are then derived to quantify the resilience and its constituting phases. The method is demonstrated using two ICT system designs for the CIGRE MV benchmark grid, considering the state estimation as an exemplary GS. The simulation results show that the proposed method can capture the differences between ICT system designs with regard to resilience metrics. The contribution can, therefore, be used to analyse, compare and potentially improve the resilience of ICT system designs for CPES.
