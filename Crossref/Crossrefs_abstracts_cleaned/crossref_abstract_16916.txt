This study is aimed to provide an approach for measuring the resilience of office buildings against flood in Malaysia. Three states were chosen namely Kelantan, Pahang, and Johor as they had been badly affected by the major flood in 2014. From the three states, nine worst-hit districts had been identified, which are Kota Bharu, Pasir Mas, Kuala Krai in Kelantan, Kuantan, Temerloh, and Pekan in Pahang, along with Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, and Mersing in Johor. The Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Industrial and Commercial Building is adapted to construct the scorecard. The essential elements were examined with regards to the office buildings within the scope of flood in Malaysia. This study used Survey questionnaire as a method in constructing the scorecard which was distributed among the managers or person in charge of the office buildings management within the study areas. The results from the survey questionnaire reflected the significance of every component in the essentials, thus relevant to be included in the final scorecard.
