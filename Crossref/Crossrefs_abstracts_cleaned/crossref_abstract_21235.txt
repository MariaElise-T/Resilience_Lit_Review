AbstractCommunicating about hardships with close others can be challenging, leading to avoidance of hardship‐related topics. Although typically considered relationally damaging, topic avoidance could serve as a beneficial or neutral strategy when paired with relationally affirming communication. The current research investigates if the resilience communication processes outlined in the communication theory of resilience mitigate the negative relational effects of topic avoidance. Hypotheses are tested in two different contexts: sibling communication during parental caregiving (N = 207) and spousal communication in the first months of the COVID‐19 pandemic (N = 598). The processes of crafting normalcy, communication networks, and productive action were beneficial across contexts. When participants reported higher engagement in these processes, topic avoidance was not significantly related to relationship satisfaction. At lower engagement levels, topic avoidance was negatively related to relationship satisfaction. Nuance between contexts existed. For example, humor moderated the effect of sibling caregiving topic avoidance but not spousal COVID‐19 topic avoidance.
