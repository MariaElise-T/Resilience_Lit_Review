This study explored the relationship between COVID-19 impacts and resilience in emerging adulthood during the final two months of the pandemic. It aimed to examine whether mental health symptoms moderated this relationship. In total, 205 university students completed an online questionnaire survey. Regression analysis was used to examine the prediction of resilience by pandemic-related impacts, and moderation analysis was used to explore the potential moderating effect of mental health on the relationship between impacts and resilience. The findings failed to confirm the hypothesis that total COVID-19 impacts would predict resilience. Rather, resource-type impacts predicted resilience [B = 0.17, p < 0.5]. Significant partial correlations found among resource, financial, and psychological impacts may go some way toward clarifying connections between impacts and resilience [for resource-type impact with financial-type impact, r = 0.48, p < 0.01; for resource-type impact with psychological impact, r = 0.22, p < 0.01]. The results confirmed the hypothesis that mental health symptoms would moderate the relationship between pandemic impacts and resilience [for the overall model, R = 0.41, ΔR2 = 0.16, MSE = 0.76, F (4, 200) = 10.19, p < 0.001; for the interaction between total COVID impacts and resilience, ΔR2 = 0.017, F (1, 200) = 3.98, p < 0.05]. Thus, emerging adult students with low or moderate levels of symptomatology were more resilient, independently of the level of pandemic-related stressors they faced. Those experiencing higher levels of mental health symptoms, in tandem with high levels of pandemic-related impacts, exhibited increasingly higher resilience levels [b = 0.17, 95% CI [0.02, 0.32], t = 2.26, p = 0.025]. These youths may be better equipped to handle severe stress and adversity thanks to skills and resources they possess and are experienced in using. The implications of these findings for each group of young people are discussed for their usefulness in directing future research and interventions to foster resilience during current and future crises and health pandemics.
