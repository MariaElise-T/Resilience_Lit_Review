Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the factors influencing nursing work performance among clinical nurses in the hospital.Methods: This descriptive correlational study collected data from 122 clinical nurses who were working in three tertiary referral hospitals in Busan. The data were collected, using self-reported questionnaires, from September 2 to October 14, 2019. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple regression using SPSS/WIN 25.0 program.Results: Nursing work performance was significantly associated with resilience, innovation oriented culture, relationship oriented culture, and hierarchy oriented culture. The factors significantly influencing nursing work performance of the participants included relationship oriented culture (<i>β</i>=.27, <i>p</i>=.015), hierarchy oriented culture (<i>β</i>=.25, <i>p</i>=.003), resilience (<i>β</i>=.19, <i>p</i>=.035), and total clinical career (<i>β</i>=.18, <i>p</i>=.030), which explained 27.3% of nursing work performance (F=8.59, <i>p</i><.001).Conclusion: The results indicate that there is a need to improve communication skills among multidisciplinary team members and to harmonize hierarchical and relational cultures in order to enhance nursing work performance. In addition, this study suggests developing interventions for enhancing the resilience of clinical nurses.
