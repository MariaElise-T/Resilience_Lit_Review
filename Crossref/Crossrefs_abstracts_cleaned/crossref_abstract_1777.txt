AbstractExtensive literature focuses on grief and loss and individual levels of resiliency, while less research has been done on cultural resiliency. This phenomenological study examined the lived experiences of using cultural resiliency to cope with traumatic loss in 2020. Compounded grief experiences and effects, emotional impacts, learned resiliency, cultural protective factors, and therapy experiences emerged as themes from these narratives. Implications for the field are provided to expand our thinking about ways to decolonize counseling.
