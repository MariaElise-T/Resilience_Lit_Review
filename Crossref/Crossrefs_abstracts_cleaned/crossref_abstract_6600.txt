 Three general types of coping (problem-focused coping, social support-seeking, and meaning-focused coping) in the transition from adolescence to early adulthood are examined. Specifically, we investigated age differences, their interdependence, and their adaptive function in respect to academic work-related stress (resilience). The present study examined these issues in a cross-sectional assessment (1,608 pupils and students between 14 and 30 years). Problem-focused coping and seeking social support were positively correlated with age. Age-moderated analyses showed pronounced associations between problem-focused coping and support-seeking in adolescence, but stronger associations between problem- and meaning-focused coping in young adulthood. Seeking social support and meaning-focused coping moderated the negative correlation between subjective stress and well-being. Age differences and the adaptive role of coping are discussed within a developmental framework.
