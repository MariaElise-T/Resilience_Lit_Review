 
This paper explores the urban population's walking behaviour and mobility pattern within a walkable environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the selected neighbourhood in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Data was collected through an online questionnaire survey. The key findings revealed that the pandemic limits pedestrian movement and changes their travelling methods due to the Malaysian government’s Movement Control Order (MCO). As a result, walking and public transportation usage have declined due to the fear of proximity in public areas. Hence, further recommendations are required to ensure walking sustainability for daily routines whilst promoting resilient and healthy cities.
