AbstractResilience has been reported to attenuate psychological burden and promote mental health. Military personnel constitute a population with a high psychological burden and poor sleep quality and are thus at a high risk of depression. This study is aim to examine the mechanism underlying the effects of resilience on perceived stress, sleep quality, and depression among Taiwanese army military personnel. A cross‐sectional survey was conducted between May 2020 and February 2021. Participants comprised 1505 voluntary army military service personnel aged 20 years or older; they completed self‐reported questionnaires measuring their perceived stress, resilience, sleep quality, and depression. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that the association between resilience and depression was partially mediated by perceived stress and sleep quality. Perceived stress is a significant mediator on the association between resilience and depression. A high level of sleep disturbance was observed in this population and results found that sleep quality showed a slight partial mediation effect on the association between resilience and depression. Resilience can alleviate the effects of stress, which in turn alleviates depression among military personnel. Promoting resilience‐enhancing education and mitigating environmental barriers to sleep is essential for reducing depressive symptoms among military personnel.
