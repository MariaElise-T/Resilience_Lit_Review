Modern enterprises operate in a highly turbulent economy. This is due to the acceleration of economic processes, reduction of economic cycles, globalisation of the economy, customisation of final products and other features of modern development. Under these conditions, management mechanisms and methods must respond to the changing environment, increase the resilience of economic entities and ensure the successful overcoming of crises, if they have already occurred. Enterprises themselves do not conduct such an analysis or conduct it very rarely. Therefore, the development of mechanisms and methods for determining financial and economic security have been and remain relevant. Their formulation and algorithmisation form the basis for the design and implementation of systems for the monitoring and early detection of crises. The object of the study is the Borovychka municipal enterprise in terms of its long-term assessment. The calculations and financial data presented in the paper are based on the financial reports of the Borovychka ME for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The author wrote a Master's thesis on the basis of this company and using its real data. The authorâ€™s calculations are available upon request. Financial data is available separately and upon request from Borovychka ME.
