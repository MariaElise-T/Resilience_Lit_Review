Background: Higher levels of resiliency and hardiness are associated with greater life satisfaction. However, there is limited information on the mediating role of married people responses to stressful life situations. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine the mediating role of stress-coping strategies in the association of resiliency and hardiness with the life satisfaction of married people. Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the statistical population included all married students of the Islamic Azad University of Rasht City (north of Iran) in the 2018-2019 academic year. They were selected using a purposive sampling method. A total of 282 students were selected as a sample. To measure the variables, Billings and Moosâ€™s coping responses inventory, the satisfaction with life scale, the Connor-Davidson resilience scale, and Ahvaz hardiness inventory were used. SPSS AMOS software, 24 full version was used for data processing. Results: According to the results of path analysis, resiliency has a significant effect on life satisfaction only through problem-focused and cognitive reappraisal-based coping responses (P<0.01) and it can explain 11% of the variance. Also, the indirect effect of hardiness on life satisfaction was not significant and this variable was deleted from the path, and the modified model was re-fitted. Conclusion: In dealing with stressful situations in life, the resilient actions of people who use problem-focused and cognitive reappraisal-based strategies lead to life satisfaction with more confidence.
