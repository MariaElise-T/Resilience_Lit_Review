 In developmental science, resilience refers to children and youthsâ€™ ability to recover and pursue positive development in the face of stress related to adversity. Extant research has documented protective factors and ecological contexts that mitigate the impact of adversity and thereby promote resilience. One intriguing aspect of resilience is that individuals also develop strength in response to early adversity. However, very little theoretical guidance exists on the developmental mechanisms and contexts through which early adversity may lead to strengthening effects that confer the process of resilience. The strengthening mechanism in the context of specific circumscribed environmental stress is a process known in the field of toxicology as hormesis. It is proposed here that the study of resilience in developmental and psychological sciences can benefit from shifting more attention to the hormesis model. The hormesis model is reviewed and discussed as a promising perspective on mechanisms, developmental timing, and context through which adversity strengthens or impedes resilience.
