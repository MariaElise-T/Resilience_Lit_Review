COVID-19 has changed the information landscape. The results were the wide spread of information of all kinds and from all sources, leading to increased information disorder (i.e. disinformation, misinformation practices). This study aimed to explore the practices of academic libraries during times of crisis from the staff perception in four public universities in Jordan to correct the information disorder and hence create information resilience among community members. Exploring these practices helps shed light on the librariesâ€™ contribution to creating information resilience practices and hence an information-resilient community. An interview was used to collect deep insights from 26 library staff working in the Information Division at the four academic libraries. The results were mainly directed towards the importance of increasing community awareness and providing access to quality information sources. It also affirmed the importance of information skills to help individuals locate the right and accurate information. It was affirmed that developing and promoting information literacy programmes was the main pillar to countering information disorder and establishing information resilience. The findings will provide insights for other academic libraries on the best practices to create a information resilient community.
