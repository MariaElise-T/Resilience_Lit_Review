Countless studies have shown that there is a connection between anxiety felt during exams and school performance. We as individuals are exposed to failure in the moment of an exam and for those who are not familiar with the context, the opportunity to fail is more probable to happen.  The goals of this study are: to identify the relation between exam anxiety and scholar resilience based on gender of the subject and the class he is a part of.  The sample of the study was formed of 96 students from IV grade. There are 57 boys and 38 girls with ages between 9 and 11. The students are from primary school number 8 and primary school number 4 from Suceava, Romania. With the mention that for all the students, we have the parents acceptance that stands for their children's to be a part of the research with the mention of their children's information to remain confidential. Research tools used for the study are: the scale to test exams anxiety- scale made by Douglas & Benson and the questionnaire of resilience-(Oshio et al., 2003/2015).  The research showed that there is a connection between exams anxiety and resilience based on gender of subject and that the level of resilience is different for all of the 4 classes that took part in the study, the biggest value belonging to the first class.  The future directions for the study could be about the influence of the teachers on the level of anxiety during exams and their influence on developing resilience in students.
