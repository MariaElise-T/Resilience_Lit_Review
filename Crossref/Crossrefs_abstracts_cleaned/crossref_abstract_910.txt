The impact of climate change is more and more often taken into account in urban development strategies and concerns mainly reducing threats and protection against the effects of extreme phenomena. Stress factors that are mainly related to civilization changes (economic and technological progress) and environmental changes (nature, resources, and climate) test a city's ability to remain functional in spite of crises. With this in mind, it is necessary to review the development strategies of contemporary cities identify the main course of action aimed at increasing the resistance to threats at the global, regional and local level, identify instruments that help in the planning of adaptations, and assess the scope of such plans.
In Poland, the idea of developing healthy and resilient cities is not as popular as in other countries. The first adaptation strategies generally focus on the risks related to extreme weather events. It is expected that subsequent plans will gradually extend the scope of adaptation, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic made us realize that crisis management is insufficient and that the city's resilience should be developed. This paper explores the idea of Healthy Cities and other contemporary concepts of urban spatial development in the context of climate change. The author puts forward a thesis about the influence of the climate agenda on the transformation of the idea of Healthy Cities into the concept of Resilient Cities. The work includes an analysis of the development strategies of European cities, with particular emphasis on the largest cities in Poland, regarding the adaptation of the urban environment to the existing and projected climate hazards. The research goal is to evaluate the strategies for city development adopted by cities in their strategic documents as well as to assess the scale of climate change and its impact on the spatial development policy.
