Abstract:  This study examines the components of resilience in adolescents (aged 11–15 years; n= 816) who were referred to the child welfare system for maltreatment. Data from a national probability study of children and families in the child welfare system showed that adolescents faced a number of risk factors like maltreatment, poverty, and exposure to violence in the community. Social competence, academic achievement, and a sense of relatedness to caregiver were fit in a structural equation model as components of latent resilience. Social competence and the quality of relationship with a caregiver were strongly linked to latent resilience.
