Unexpected worldwide disruptions brought various challenges to supply chain management thus manipulating the research direction towards resilience. Since the supplier is one of the important supply chain elements, the challenges can be overcome through resilient supplier selection. Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem where several criteria are involved. In this study, GRA-BWM-TOPSIS was proposed to evaluate resilient suppliers. Seven resilience criteria which were Quality, Lead Time, Cost, Flexibility, Visibility, Responsiveness and Financial Stability have been proposed and five experts were selected to provide judgments for the selection process. By using the proposed method, the criteria importance levels were obtained using GRA and the criteria weights were computed using BWM, together with a consistency test. TOPSIS was applied to evaluate the suppliersâ€™ performances. Through a case study in a food manufacturing company, 10 suppliers were evaluated and ranked. A validation process was carried out and the managerial implications were provided to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. GRA-BWM-TOPSIS is suitable for resilient supplier selection when there are uncertainties and incomplete data.
