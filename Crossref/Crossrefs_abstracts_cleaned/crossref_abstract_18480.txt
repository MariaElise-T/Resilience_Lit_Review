Background The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the resilience of health care systems worldwide. In this regard, one group of people whose physical and mental health has been affected has been family caregivers of people with dementia. Objective This study aims to identify the variables that predict a high degree of well-being in family caregivers of people with dementia during this period of mandatory lockdown. Methods A total of 310 respondents participated in an online survey (266 women and 44 men) from various regions in Spain, aged between 20 and 73 years old (M = 46.45; SD = 15.97), and all were family members. Results The results showed that there were notable differences in all the protective variables, together with a significant strong positive relationship between well-being and resilience ( r = 0.92; p < 0.01) and with coping strategies ( r = 0.85; p < 0.01), and there were also some significant negative relationships between well-being and difficulties in emotional regulation (ρ = −.78; p < 0.01). The most predictive variables of a higher level of well-being included the type of dementia (β = 1.19; CI (95%) = 1.01-1.29; p< 0.01), living in a large house (β = 0.97; CI (95%) =. 23-0.98; p < 0.01), social support as a coping strategy (β = 1.27; CI (95%) = 1.21-1.29; p < 0.01) and mainly resilience (β = 1.34; CI (95%) = 1.30-1.37; p < 0.01). Discussion We discuss the importance of promoting higher levels of resilience through the development of protective psychosocial variables in caregivers of people with dementia exposed to situations of mandatory social isolation as a modulator of the psychosocial well-being of these family caregivers.
