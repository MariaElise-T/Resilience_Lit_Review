The Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale is a commonly used measure of resilience. However, while resilience is considered multidimensional, the specific dimensions embedded within this scale remain equivocal. The aim of this article was to contribute to this debate by analyzing responses from a large sample obtained within a mental health setting. Baseline data from 672 consecutive referrals to a publicly funded outpatient service for adults with anxiety and depression were subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Outcome data from 349 of these participants who had completed treatment were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis. Both analytical strategies suggested that two dimensions were evident (Adaptability and Tenacity), although comparisons of Adaptability and Tenacity across sociodemographic, diagnostic, psychological distress, and functional impairment variables provided little support for their discriminability. The practical utility to mental health nurses of subcomponents of resilience remains clinically persuasive yet empirically elusive with current instrumentation.
