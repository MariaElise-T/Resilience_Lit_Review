The study focused on the research and development of ICT for disaster preparedness and response with respect to two categories, namely, the delivery of alert messages to a wider group of residents and providing quick relief communications in affected areas. In the former category, the development focused on two targets, one involving the delivery of alert messages to indoor residents with a V-Low broadcasting service and the other involving the delivery of an alert message to individuals with disabilities and difficulties in understanding Japanese. In the latter category, a portable ICT unit was developed for rapid relief communications and mesh network technology enabling robust information sharing among base stations in the affected area was developed. Furthermore, a related development focused on a resilient information management system to collect information in areas that do not have access to the Internet. Furthermore, device relay technology was developed to expand access network cover areas. After the development of individual technology, activities for the societal implementation of the development results were conducted through field experiments and disaster drills in which the developed technologies were integrated and utilized.
