Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate predictors of emotional labor and resilience on clinical competence in nursing students. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was distributed to 120 nursing students. Structured questionnaires addressing emotional labor, resilience, and clinical competence were employed. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and regression were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 116 surveys were analyzed. Satisfaction of clinical practice and major showed statistically significant differences in clinical competence (F=6.59, p=.002; F=11.32, p<.001, respectively). Clinical competence was positively associated with resilience (r=.67, p<.001). Regression analyses showed that satisfaction of clinical practice and major, and resilience were statistically significant in predicting clinical competence with the explanatory power of 46.4% (F=20.91, p<.001). Conclusion: The results showed that resilience was the critical predictor of clinical competence in nursing students. It is therefore necessary to develop resilience programs to help improve clinical competence in nursing students.
