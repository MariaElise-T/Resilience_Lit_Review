AbstractBackgroundIn this study, we investigate how socio‐demographic characteristics (age, gender and education) and informal care relationship characteristics (e.g., time spent on care, number of informal caregivers, professional care) are linked with informal care burden during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In addition, we expect this burden to differ by personality characteristics, degree of resilience, and—in this specific context—perceived the COVID‐19 threat.MethodWe used the fifth wave of a longitudinal study to identify 258 informal caregivers. These online survey data came from a five‐wave longitudinal study in Flanders, Belgium that ran from April 2020 to April 2021. Data were representative of the adult population by age and gender. Analyses include t‐tests, ANOVA, SEM and binomial logistic regression.ResultsWe found that the informal care burden was strongly linked with a socio‐economic gradient, time investment changes in care since the start of the pandemic, and whether there was more than one informal caregiver. Personality traits such as agreeableness and openness to experience, and the perceived threat of COVID‐19 were also related to care burden.ConclusionsDuring the pandemic, informal caregivers were put under extra considerable pressure: restrictive government measures sometimes led to the temporary suspension of some or all professional care for persons with care needs, which may have resulted in a growing psychosocial burden. We recommend that, in the future, the focus should be on supporting the mental wellbeing and social participation of caregivers along with measures to protect caregivers and their relatives from COVID‐19. Support structures for informal caregivers should be kept running during crises now and in the future, but it is also important to adopt a case‐by‐case basis to consider support for informal caregivers.
