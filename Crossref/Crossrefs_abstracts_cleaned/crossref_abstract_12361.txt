One of the productive economic growth sectors that serves as the foundation for Bengkulu Province's coastal development program is the development of fishermen's businesses through the home industry. The goal of this study was to investigate the features of the Ikan Asap home industry as well as to examine the resilience of fishermen in the Ikan Asap home industry in Bengkulu Province. The descriptive analysis method is used in the investigation. From the last 5 (years), precisely from 2018 to 2022, the innovation has been tested using the publish or perish application. Then VOSviewer is used to visualize bibliographies or data sets in order to identify themes that still have research opportunities. The study's findings indicate the peculiarities of the Ikan Asap home industry for fishermen, both boat owners and crew members. The primary element in the Ikan Asap industry is fresh fish, but fish that are not sold fresh are occasionally used as raw materials. The equipment used is still basic and privately owned. Because the level of marine Ikan Asap production is relatively low, namely an average of 10 kg per production, capital availability is an impediment, and Ikan Asap production is sold to the market and collectors. On the market, sell. The level of resilience of fishermen in the growth of home industries for the production aspect is 17.13 in the weak category, 16.75 in the weak category, and 6.44 on average for capital or credit institutions. Category is lacking. In the medium group, the average level of resilience in terms of market institutions is 7.88. Fishermen in extension institutions have a medium level of resilience, with an average of 7.66.
