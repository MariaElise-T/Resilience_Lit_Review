Efficiency and resilience are two essential challenges that require attention for high-quality development under the new normal. In this research, we measured tourism eco-efficiency using the Super-SBM model with undesirable output about data from 31 provinces in China from 2010 to 2019; economic resilience through the entropy weighted Topsis model; and finally, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of tourism eco-efficiency and economic resilience. The findings showed that, from 2010 to 2019, the 31 provincesâ€™ eco-efficiency values were low, with large and low variances in efficiency values among provinces with an uneven distribution. The economic resilience values of the 31 provinces were relatively low. Still, the economic resilience of each province had been relatively stable over the years, and the pattern of regional distribution of resilience values was generally consistent. The level of coupling coordination between tourism eco-efficiency and economic resilience was low in the 31 provinces, with low coordination type dominating, and the spatiotemporal patterns were the same. Its coupling coordination degree fluctuated and increased, but the increase was minor.
