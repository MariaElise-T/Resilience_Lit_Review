AbstractLittle work has focused on resilience amongst older adults, and few factors have been identified that promote their resilience. Kalisch et al. suggest that socioenvironmental factors are distant influences. We argue, however, that community and societal influences are as important as individual ones. Further, an ecological framework explains why some older adults are resilient whilst others are not.
