PurposeThis study analyzes the role of supply chain ambidexterity (SC-Ambidexterity) in developing supply chain resilience (SC-Resilience). We describe SC-Ambidexterity as a simultaneous application of supply chain adaptability (SC-Adaptability) and supply chain alignment (SC-Alignment) capabilities. We also consider the role of supply chain agility (SC-Agility) in the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience. We further suggest that the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience may be stronger in case of higher market uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachBased on the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) of the firm, we develop a set of hypotheses that are tested through a survey of manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The hypothesized model is tested through structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThe results of this study show a positive effect of SC-Ambidexterity on SC-Resilience. SC-Agility positively mediates the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience. However, our results show that this relationship does not vary at different levels of environmental uncertainty.Originality/valueThis study provides the seminal operationalization of SC-Ambidexterity in the supply chain context. It further shows the importance of SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Agility in contributing toward SC-Resilience.
