Abstract

Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate psychological correlates of self-rated resilience, as assessed with the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD–RISC–10), in older adults. In particular, we were interested in the degree to which self-rated resilience might be a protective factor against cognitive decline.


Method
In total, 100 adults aged 60–90 years who had been referred because of subjective cognitive concerns completed self-report measures of resilience, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and satisfaction with life. They also completed a test of learning and memory. Ratings about daily functioning at home and in the community were obtained from both participants and proxy informants.


Results
Resilience ratings correlated strongly negatively with concurrent self-rated symptoms of anxiety and depression, and strongly positively with self-rated life satisfaction. However, only informant ratings of daily functioning correlated with actual participant performance on a test of learning and memory, with lower ratings being associated with worse test performance.


Conclusions
Self-rated resilience, as measured by the CD–RISC–10, is primarily related to subjective well-being and does not inform sufficiently about relative risk for cognitive dysfunction in older adults.
