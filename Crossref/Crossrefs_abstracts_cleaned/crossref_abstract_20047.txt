Abstract
Improving the thermal resilience of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) broadens their applicability as sensing devices and is necessary to ensure their operation under harsh environments. In this work, we are address the impact of temperature on the degradation of the magnetic reference in field sensor stacks based on MgO-MTJs. Our study starts by simple MnIr/CoFe bilayers to gather enough insights into the role of critical morphological and magnetic parameters and their impact in the temperature dependent behavior. The exchange bias coupling field (H
ex), coercive field (H
c), and blocking temperature (T
b) distribution are tuned, combining tailored growth conditions of the antiferromagnet and different buffer layer materials and stackings. This is achieved by a unique combination of ion beam deposition and magnetron sputtering, without vaccum break. Then, the work then extends beyond bilayers into more complex state-of-the-art MgO MTJ stacks as those employed in commercial sensing applications. We systematically address their characteristic fields, such as the width of the antiferromagnetic coupling plateau ΔH, and study their dependence on temperature. Although, [Ta/CuN] buffers showed higher key performance indications (e.g. H
ex) at room temperature in both bilayers and MTJs, [Ta/Ru] buffers showed an overall wider ΔH up to 200 °C, more suitable to push high temperature operations. This result highlights the importance of properly design a suitable buffer layer system and addressing the complete MTJ behavior as function of temperature, to deliver the best stacking design with highest resilience to high temperature environments.
