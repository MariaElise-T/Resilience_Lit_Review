AbstractDistributed energy resources (DERs) provide flexible load restoration strategies, which can effectively enhance the resilience of active distribution systems (ADSs). Whereas, the widespread DERs in ADSs complicates the supply‐demand relationship and make the system resilience difficult to access. Therefore, this paper proposes a simulation‐based resilience assessment algorithm of ADSs considering the microgrid formation based on grid‐edge DERs. Microgrid formation is used to depict the resilience gain of grid‐edge DERs on ADSs. Specifically, a resilience assessment framework for ADSs is firstly proposed, where the uncertainty of component state and supply‐demand is modelled based on probability statistics. Then the mixed integer linear programming is used to search for optimal load restoration strategies with microgrid formation. On this basis, a set of resilience indices are defined to quantitatively analyse the resilience of ADSs, and a resilience assessment algorithm with uncertainty scenario generation is proposed to obtain these indices. Furthermore, extensive numerical results based on a modified IEEE 123‐bus feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
