The focal article “How Much Do We Really Know About Employee Resilience?” by Britt, Shen, Sinclair, Grossman, and Klieger (2016) is an informative work concerning the paucity of resilience research in organizational science. This commentary serves two purposes: (a) to provide specific recommendations relevant to the aims of the focal article and (b) to present additional unexplored areas that would contribute to what we “really know about employee resilience.” First, I offer suggestions concerning two fundamental issues within resilience research mentioned by Britt et al.: the lack of conceptual clarity and the lack of agreement concerning the characterization of significant adversity. Second, I present three directions for future research: incorporating levels of analysis, developing resilience typologies, and deepening theoretical representations. This commentary complements the focal article by highlighting both specific recommendations and novel areas deserving of exploration.
