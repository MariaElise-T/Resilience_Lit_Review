AbstractAlthough APOE ɛ4 has been identified as the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease, there are some APOE ɛ4 carriers who do not go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease or cognitive impairment. This study aims to investigate factors contributing to this “resilience” separately by gender. Data were drawn from APOE ɛ4 positive participants who were aged 60 + at baseline in the Personality and Total Health Through Life (PATH) Study (N = 341, Women = 46.3%). Participants were categorised into “resilient” and “non-resilient” groups using Latent Class Analysis based on their cognitive impairment status and cognitive trajectory across 12 years. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk and protective factors that contributed to resilience stratified by gender. For APOE ɛ4 carriers who have not had a stroke, predictors of resilience were increased frequency of mild physical activity and being employed at baseline for men, and increased number of mental activities engaged in at baseline for women. The results provide insights into a novel way of classifying resilience among APOE ɛ4 carriers and risk and protective factors contributing to resilience separately for men and women.
