Aims: This paper aimed to examine preschool teachers' perception and understanding on the construct of “resilience” as well as the applied strategies for fostering preschoolers’ resilience at the classroom.
Study Design:  The study was conducted between January 2023 and May 2023 and a qualitative methodological approach was adopted.
Methodology: Data were collected through semi-structured, open questioned interviews with 16 preschool teachers (all women, age range 35- 56 years, with working experience from 5 to 20 years) working in public kindergarten at different regions of Greece territory.
Results: Thematic analysis was applied and the findings indicated that the majority of the participants perceived resilience as the ability to cope with adversity and bounce back, which is cultivated and didn’t constitute a character trait. In relation to the strategies used by preschool teachers to promote resilience they emphasized the significance of the closeness of their relationship with children and family, the enhancement of social- emotional knowledge and skills (self-regulation, maintaining friendly relationships), the development of a positive classroom climate and the adaptation of proactive teaching practices (student-oriented and group-cooperative approach).
Conclusion: Although preschool teachers seemed adequate enough to foster resilience in young children they expressed their desire for more training in this field, as well as the need for support from experts (e.g. school psychologists, educational support structures).
