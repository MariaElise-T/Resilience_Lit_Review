This study aims to examine the mediating effect of climate resilience on the relationship between socio-economic, social relationship, social environment, and sense of community with fishermen’s subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive feeling, and negative feeling). This quantitative study performed a multi-stage sampling and selected 400 fishermen as respondents. For analysis purpose, this study relied on Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The structural model concluded that socio-economic, social relationship, social environment, and sense of community explained 55.4% variance in resilience. The mediating analysis confirmed the resiliency mediating effect on all twelve hypothesized relationships. A number of recommendations related to extending the areas of the study, to focus specifically on the small-scale fishermen, and to consider the inclusion of several others’ additional mediating effects were highlighted.
