This article aims to analyze the moderating effect of supply chain configuration on the relationship between dynamic supply chain capabilities and resilience in the retail sector in Kenya. We used an ex-post facto research design. The study used a stratified random sampling technique to select a sample size of 324 respondents from a population of 3200 employees working in retail chains in Nairobi City County. Further, the study used questionnaires as primary data collection instruments. Data analysis was done using both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The study rejected the null hypothesis that supply chain configuration does not moderate the relationship between dynamic supply chain capabilities and resilience in the retail sector. From the analysed data, the moderating effect of SCC had a reducing impact on the relationship between dynamic SC capabilities and resilience in the retail industry. In this regard, the study makes some substantive recommendations; that retail chains should re-evaluate their suppliers upstream and engage in objective supplier base reduction and rationalization to reconfigure their retail chains.
