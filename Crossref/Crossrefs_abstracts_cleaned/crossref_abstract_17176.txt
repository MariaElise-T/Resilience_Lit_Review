Abstract

Objectives
Grit and resilience are related but separate concepts. Grit is a long-term commitment toward goals, and it impacts student success and academic achievement. Resilience is the ability of students to recover from stress. Both are important factors in nursing students.


Methods
This descriptive study included surveys measuring demographics, grit, and resilience among two cohorts of senior nursing students in their last semester and explored challenges and difficulties experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Results
The mean grit score for all students was 4.0 (0.52) and the mean resilience score was 3.63 (0.73). Directed content analysis of the ten open-ended survey questions revealed three themes: Impact on Education, Personal Impact, and Coping Mechanisms.


Conclusions
Grit and resilience are important factors that can contribute to success in nursing programs and as graduate nurses in the healthcare settings.
