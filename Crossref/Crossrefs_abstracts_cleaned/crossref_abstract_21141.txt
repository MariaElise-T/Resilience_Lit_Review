This study intended to test the relationship between resilience and well-being among young adults in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic. In light of the amount and sort of adaptations and adjustments brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic on various aspects of the life of the youth, coupled with the questionable social support they receive during the different phases of the pandemic (early on and most recently), enduring such chronic state of stress presented a much needed exploration into their psychological states and resources in order to map out the kind of support and ecosystem needed for the young generation to still be able to thrive in post-pandemic society 5.0. The study made use of correlational statistics to test the relationship between levels of resilience and well-being among young adults in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The participants (gathered via convenience sampling) were 36 young adults in the age range 18-25 years located in Jakarta during the pandemic. Correlational results found significant negative and moderate relationship between resilience and well-being of young adults in Jakarta, r=-0.425, p<.01. It was found that the higher the resilience, the lower the well-being of young adults in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
