The ‘big Boro rice harvest’ in 2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has created new optimism for a resilient rice system in Bangladesh. Boro rice (dry season rice) has appeared as the strategic crop in sustaining resilience in the national rice system and food security with a steady rise in production trend. However, the prospect of Boro rice has been challenged by a myriad of factors such as changing climate, hydrological regimes, value-chain and crop diversification. Any unexpected production loss of Boro rice might bring about a big setback in total food security. Therefore, holistic policy planning and research supports, strong value-chain, efficient procurement system and, farmer’s capacity development have been suggested to sustain the production trend of Boro rice in the year to come.
