AbstractReturn on investment (ROI) has long been accepted as a primary tool for decision‚Äêmaking for capital investments and even choices among competing operational budget lines. Applying ROI to investments intended to prevent or mitigate future risks and hazards can be very difficult, as benefits are typically arduous to define and calculate while risk probabilities can be very small. This paper uses examples from recent research concerning law enforcement, airport security, and airport resiliency to illustrate the feasibility of computing ROI and resiliency ROI (RROI) for such investments and to suggest methodology to approach these computations.
