 Using the conservation of resource perspective, this study empirically tested the moderating role of follower proactive personality between servant leadership and follower positive outcomes (psychological resilience and ownership). Previous literature remained confined to the theories that highlights the positive impact of servant leadership on the followers, ignoring the contingency perspective. The positive outcomes of servant leadership may not be categorized as a generic remedy for every employee working under a servant leader as each individual perceived resource gain may vary. Data of 348 responses gathered from the higher education institute faculty members working in Pakistanâ€™s public sector universities using a self-reported questionnaire. The results indicate that servant leadership along with follower proactive personality work as a key ingredient in developing positive follower resilience. This study also found that it is not servant leadership alone itself that is positive, but its influence on followers also affected by the proactive personality type of the followers.
