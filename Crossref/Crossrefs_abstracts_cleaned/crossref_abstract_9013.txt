The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a shift from traditional classroom instruction to online learning. Students who learn online, experience mental health issues because of these developments. To solve this issue, people must be resilient enough to modify their learning styles. The study aims to identify the nursing care delivery modalities that can improve students’ resilience during the online learning phase. Scoping review was employed in this study with the help of articles from the databases of CINAHL, PubMed, and ProQuest. The words ”resilience” and ”student OR undergraduate student” and ”pandemic covid-19 OR covid-19” were used in the English language. Full text, randomized control trial or quasi-experiment research designs, the use of the English language, student populations and samples, and publication dates within the last 10 years were the requirements for inclusion in this study (2013-2022). We found 10 articles discussing about nursing interventions to increase resilience in students who learning online. There are training interventions mindfulness interventions, and internet-based interventions. The three interventions can increase student resilience in online learning so that student achievement increases and can adapt to changes in learning methods. There are three types of nursing interventions to increase resilience during the Covid- 19 pandemic for students, namely training, mindfulness, and Internet-based intervention.
