Abstract:  Clinical evidence indicates the influence of viewing ultrasound on women's investment in health during pregnancy. Ongoing work on the effects of ultrasound consultation (UC) include: establishing a replicable UC and demonstrating validity of the UC by examining effects of UC on behavioral and physiological indicators of increased resilience in maternal health and pregnancy outcome. The study indicated that UC significantly increased maternal–fetal attachment, decreased maternal anxiety, and increased positive attitudes toward health during pregnancy. Ongoing research involves using UC in two protocols with pregnant women, for instance, those experiencing moderate‐to‐severe depression and those at risk for noncompliance in treatment for gestational diabetes.
