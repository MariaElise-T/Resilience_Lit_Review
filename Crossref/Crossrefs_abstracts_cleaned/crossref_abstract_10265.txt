Utilities are working to strengthen and evolve their electric grid operations to deliver power with higher reliability and safety, resulting in superior customer service. In addition to these traditional, yet still very relevant objectives, the concept of improving grid resiliency is one that electric grid operators, regulators and customers are increasingly interested in. There is a growing awareness and recognition that a more resilient electric system is essential for the modern and sustained economic prosperity of local communities and residents. Grid resilience has long been in the lexicon of utilities and their stakeholders. However, evolving legislative and regulatory mandates are increasing the urgency for focused solution planning and execution.
