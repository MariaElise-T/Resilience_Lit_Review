Objective
Burnout is a problem among physicians. Debriefing may be a tool to decrease burnout and increase resiliency in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) providers. The objective of this study was to determine rates of burnout and resiliency in PEM fellows and their experience with debriefing.


Methods
A validated survey was administered to PEM fellows during their first and then third years of fellowship. The survey included the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Index (MBI), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and debriefing experience. The percent of respondents with moderate to high burnout was determined by their scores in each of 3 MBI categories. Their resilience was determined by the BRS score. The effect of debriefing on resiliency scores was analyzed.


Results
There were 47 first-year respondents (of 148 first-year PEM fellows) and 34 third-year respondents (of 118 third-year PEM fellows). There were burnout scores in at least 1 MBI category in 80.9% of first years and 65% of third years. In first years, 42.6% showed burnout in personal accomplishment, 38.3% in depersonalization, and 55.3% in emotional exhaustion. By third year, they were 35.3%, 29.4%, and 52.9%, respectively. About 59% of first and third years had low resiliency scores. Fifty-five percent of first year respondents felt comfortable with debriefing compared with 67.6% of third years. The fellows' comfort and experience with debriefing did not significantly affect their BRS score.


Conclusions
This study shows that many first-year PEM fellows already have signs of burnout and low resiliency. However, by third year, there was improvement in burnout scores. Additional tools provided in fellowship may help prevent burnout in PEM fellows.
