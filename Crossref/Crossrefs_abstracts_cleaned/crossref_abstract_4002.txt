<p>Economic globalization has intensified economic volatility around the world, and the importance of economic resilience has become increasingly prominent in the face of rising uncertainty due to frequent domestic and foreign shocks. Based on provincial panel data in China from 2008-2019, a comprehensive indicator system is constructed to measure regional economic resilience (RER), and the impact of financial driver (FD) on RER is explored from staged, pathway and non-linear perspectives. The main findings are as follows. (1) Both national and regional levels of FD and RER show an upward trend, and the impact of FD on RER has an &ldquo;inverted-U&rdquo; shape: as the capacity of FD increases, its impact on regional economic resilience shifts from promoting to inhibiting. The RER has significant spatial agglomeration characteristic. (2) Interestingly, staged analysis shows FD can significantly promote RER only when it is in the &ldquo;recovery stage&rdquo;. (3) The pathway analysis of its effect on regional economic resilience shows the following characteristics: financial scale &gt; financial efficiency &gt; financial deepening. (4) From different regions, there are significant differences in the effect of FD on the promotion of regional economic resilience: central region &gt; western region &gt; eastern region. Finally, the corresponding suggestions were provided.</p>
