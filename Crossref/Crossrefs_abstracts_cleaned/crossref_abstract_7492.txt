Associate Editorâ€™s Note
This article is an adapted version of Dr. Jacqueline Zinn's Keith G. Provan Distinguished Scholar Award plenary to the Health Care Management Division of the Academy of Management in 2020. We are excited to share it with you because it is noteworthy among scholarly career award plenaries. Specifically, the article does two big things exceptionally well: (a) provides a compelling and informative retrospective on a truly exceptional scholarly career renowned for work that consistently and deeply engages with practice, practitioners, and emerging, urgent problems in a conceptually and empirically rigorous manner and (b) inventively connects her research to the health care, managerial, and organizational challenges posed by the pandemic (and pandemics from prior eras) to provide a forward looking research agenda on organizational resilience and well-being that offers ready-made conceptual development and empirical work for the next generation.
