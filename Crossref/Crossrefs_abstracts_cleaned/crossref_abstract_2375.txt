Worldwide energy shortages and the green energy revolution have triggered an increase in the penetration of standalone microgrids. However, they have limited generation capacity and are wasteful when excess generated energy is curtailed. This presents an opportunity for the coordinated operation of multiple prosumer microgrids that absorb this waste to enhance their resiliency and reliability. This paper proposes a reliable prosumer model with an inbuilt energy management system (EMS) simulator that considers the mentioned deficiencies for constructing resilient interconnected prosumer microgrids. The EMS simulator operates in a real-time dynamic environment to coordinate the prosumer components and performs flexible switching for (1) prioritizing critical load by shedding the non-critical load and (2) meeting load demand locally or from other interconnected prosumers. The EMS simulator maintains energy balance by setting limits for the battery energy storage system (BESS) to preserve energy during low generation and performs real-time monitoring. The novelty of this model lies in its simplicity and flexibility, which allows interconnected prosumer microgrids to operate in cooperation without the need for communication. The proposed model is evaluated in a post-disaster off-grid scenario using a single-phase average value model that considers reasonable computation time. The simulation results of the proposed system indicate the preservation of stored energy while maintaining critical resources beyond three days of poor weather conditions.
