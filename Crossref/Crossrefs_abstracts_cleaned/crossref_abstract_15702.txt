Abstract
This study applies the BRIC – Baseline Resilience Indicator for Communities – as a case study to the city of Porto Alegre. The purpose of quantifying resilience is to allow the identification of the constraints of that city considering its 17 participatory budgeting regions to increase resilience over time. Utilizing five TOC focusing steps is suggested so that the identified constraints may be exploited and “broken” effectively. At the end, three significant constraints were identified, which lead to the conclusion that there is room for improvement in the city and in the adequacy of the tool regarding the proposed case, enabling further research opportunities.
