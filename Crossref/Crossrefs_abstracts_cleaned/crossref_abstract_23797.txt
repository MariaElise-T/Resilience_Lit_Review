The current shortage of nurses is an important global issue. Most male nurses leave nursing within four years of starting their nursing career. It is crucial to understand the influencing factors on newly graduated male nurses staying in nursing. Previous studies on intentions to stay as nurses were seldom based on theory and failed to consider the differences between genders. Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, this study tested the model that social support, resilience, and nursing professional commitment influence the intention to stay and the mediating effect of nursing professional commitment in the above relationship. This cross-sectional study adopted purposive and snowball sampling methods. Data were collected using online questionnaire, and 272 newly graduated male nurses completed it. The hypothetical model had a good fit with the data. Nursing professional commitment had a complete mediating effect between social support and intention to stay and between resilience and intention to stay. Nursing professional commitment was highly positively correlated to intention to stay. It is suggested that future research and practice should enhance male nursesâ€™ professional commitment to increase their intention to stay. The findings can serve as reference for developing newly graduated male nurse retention programs.
