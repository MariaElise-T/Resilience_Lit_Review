In this article we revisit the concept of resilience and what it means for midwifery. We are aware that the idea of ‘resilience’ is receiving increasingly negative coverage within the midwifery community. However, how resilience is defined and understood seems to have shifted significantly from its original meaning. We consider why that shift might have happened and explore what resilience is and what it isn’t. We argue that the original meaning of the concept still has a great deal to offer the profession as we navigate these challenging times.
