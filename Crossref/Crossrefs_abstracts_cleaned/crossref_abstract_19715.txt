The ontology of high-level resilience constructs in the context of building information protection systems at the organizational level is studied. The principles of interaction between these constructs and the elements of an organization’s structure and its assets, which are integral components of the resilience-building framework, are described in detail. The process of identi¬fying an organization’s critical functions and the associated risks as a foundation for constructing its resilience is highlighted. It is posited that in organizational configurations where a single entity encompasses multiple subdivisions or interconnected organizations, the resilience of the entire system cannot simply be viewed as the aggregate resilience of its constituent parts.
