Resilience is an important issue in urban development, and community resilience (CR) is the most typical representative in building urban resilience, which has become the forefront of international resilience research. This paper presents a bibliometric and visual analysis of community resilience research collected from the WoS Core Collection database over the past two decades. H-index, citation frequency, centrality and starting year were adopted to analyze the research objects by bibliometric tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Gephi. The national and institutional characteristics of macro-geographical distribution and the characteristics of disciplines, journals, authors, and author cooperation of micro-knowledge network distribution were revealed. Finally, the potential research directions of community resilience in the future were discussed. The results show that there are three stages in community resilience research. Seven intellectual bases constitute the research background for community resilience, including social capital mechanism, the evolution of resilience knowledge, earthquake resistance and disaster mitigation, substance abuse, resilient development in rural communities, resilience-building in the least-developed countries, and emergency preparedness. Our analysis shows that the hottest community resilience research topics are the concept of resilience, climate resilience, the social capital mechanism, macro-environment and disaster-reduction policies, and an evaluation index system for community resilience.
