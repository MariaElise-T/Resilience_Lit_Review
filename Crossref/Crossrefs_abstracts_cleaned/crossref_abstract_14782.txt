The resilience of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is its joint capability to resist possible threat, adapt to disruptive events, and restore its intended performance under a specific time period. The quantitative assessment of the UAV swarm resilience requires a thorough understanding of its missions. In this paper, a mission-oriented framework is proposed to implement the resilience evaluation for the UAV swarm. Guided by the framework, the resilience evaluation for the UAV swarm performing joint reconnaissance mission is studied. A UAV swarm model is developed for joint reconnaissance mission based on complex networks and agent-based models. The following aspects of the UAV swarm are considered in the proposed model, namely, the mission orientation, UAV attributes, swarm topology, UAV cooperative strategy, UAV information exchange and fusion strategy, potential threats, recovery strategies, etc. Then, a novel performance metric is proposed to measure the mission capability of the UAV swarm performing joint reconnaissance mission. Results from the simulations show that, compared with existing studies, the proposed approach can provide more realistic and objective resilience evaluation for the mission-oriented UAV swarm. The above works can be used to support the decision making and the optimal design of the UAV swarm, given different missions.
