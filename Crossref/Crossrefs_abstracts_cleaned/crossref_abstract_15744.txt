AbstractIn recent years, the increased frequency of natural hazards has led to more disruptions in power grids, potentially causing severe infrastructural damages and cascading failures. Therefore, it is important that the power system resilience be improved by implementing new technology and utilizing optimization methods. This paper proposes a data‐driven spatial distributionally robust optimization (DS‐DRO) model to provide an optimal plan to install and dispatch distributed energy resources (DERs) against the uncertain impact of natural hazards such as typhoons. We adopt an accurate spatial model to evaluate the failure probability with regard to system components based on wind speed. We construct a moment‐based ambiguity set of the failure distribution based on historical typhoon data. A two‐stage DS‐DRO model is then formulated to obtain an optimal resilience enhancement strategy. We employ the combination of dual reformulation and a column‐and‐constraints generation algorithm, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a modified IEEE 13‐node reliability test system projected in the Hong Kong region.
