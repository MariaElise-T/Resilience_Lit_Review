AbstractResilience often addresses preparedness of systems and social units to internal or/and external hazards, and the subsequent recovery. Preparedness is primarily associated with the designed, as‐built, pre‐disaster phase of a system, whereas recovery deals with the post‐disruption response. As the damage of a system and the service disruption are associated with inherent properties of its components, in addition to the magnitude of the hazard, recovery is additionally influenced by external factors, such as the state of the access infrastructure. This study demonstrates a simulation approach to quantify a metric of resilience, in this case the integral loss of function or service. A case study on the impact of floods on a natural gas network is presented, considering the geospatial location of the network, the areas with and without service, the required times for travel to the damage locations, and inspection/repair. The results underscore how the priorities selected for recovery can lead to strikingly different outcomes in terms of the resilience measure.
