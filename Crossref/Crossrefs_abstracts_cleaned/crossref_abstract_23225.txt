AbstractPositive feedback is key to producing alternative stable states and largely determines ecological resilience in response to external perturbations. Understanding the positive feedback mechanisms in macrophyte‐dominated lakes is crucial for resilience‐based management and restoration. Based on the field investigation of submerged macrophyte communities in 35 lakes in China, we found that morphological complexity (MC) and morphological plasticity (MP) are correlated with the stoichiometric homeostasis of phosphorus (HP) and are related to ecosystem structure, functioning, and stability. We also found that the positive feedback strength of lakes dominated by macrophytes is biomass‐ and diversity‐dependent. Eutrophication can decrease the community biomass by decreasing community MC, MP, and HP and the species diversity through low‐light availability, ultimately decreasing the positive feedback strength and resilience of clear water states. We argue that functional traits and species diversity should be considered to build more resilient ecosystems in future changing environment scenarios.
