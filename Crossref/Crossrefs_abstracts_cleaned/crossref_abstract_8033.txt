AbstractCyclones are a poorly described disturbance in tropical lakes, with the potential to alter ecosystems and compromise the services they provide. In November 2020, Hurricanes Eta and Iota made landfall near the Nicaragua-Honduras border, inundating the region with a large amount of late-season precipitation. To understand the impact of these storms on Lake Yojoa, Honduras, we compared 2020 and 2021 conditions using continuous (every 16 days) data collected from five pelagic locations. The storms resulted in increased Secchi depth and decreased algal abundance in December 2020, and January and February 2021, and lower-than-average accumulation of hypolimnetic nutrients from the onset of stratification (April 2021) until mixus in November 2021. Despite the reduced hypolimnetic nutrient concentrations, epilimnetic nutrient concentrations returned to (and in some cases exceeded) pre-hurricane levels following annual water column turnover in 2021. This response suggests that Lake Yojoa’s trophic state had only an ephemeral response to the disturbance imposed by the two hurricanes, likely due to internal input of sediment derived nutrients. These aseasonal storms acted as a large-scale experiment that resulted in nutrient dilution and demonstrated the resilience of Lake Yojoa’s trophic state to temporary nutrient reductions.
