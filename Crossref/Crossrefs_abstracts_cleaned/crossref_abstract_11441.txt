This paper examines and reports on the efficacy of work-based personal resilience training in a provincial police force in the north of UK. Taking a contextual view, data is modelled from an ASSET survey (n = 350) that provides evidence of the manifestations and consequences of providing such input, in comparison with respondents who had no training and were in the same organisation. The findings support the use of such training programmes (Hesketh et al., 2015) for improving employee well-being and resilience by addressing the sources of stress and educating the workforce in how to deal with these stressors. This research provides compelling evidence that resilient individuals are better equipped to deal with the stressful nature of both policing and an uncertain working environment. This paper posits that effective leadership, a working environment congruent with employee well-being, and investment in resilience programmes for the workforce enhance subsequent organisational performance and are a marker of good practice.
