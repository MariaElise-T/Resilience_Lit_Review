Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to suspension of pharmacy education in resource-limited settings, negatively impacting pharmaceutical workforce outputs.
Aims: To identify the elements of a COVID-19 resilient pharmacy education programme in Namibia and its grassroots impact on the pharmaceutical workforce and systems strengthening.
Methods: An evaluation of COVID-19 resilience of the Diploma in Pharmacy programme in Namibia. Data on elements for resilience and outcomes were collected; qualitative and quantitative data were analysed descriptively.
Results: The evaluation identified ten key elements for successful implementation of a COVID-19 resilient pharmacy education programme. The integration of quality improvement projects in the workplace strengthened pharmaceutical systems and workforce capacity in areas of rational medicine use and supply management of medicines.
Conclusions: Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted pharmacy education, this paper presents ten elements that, when implemented, may improve the resilience and minimise unforeseen academic interruptions during pandemics.
