The modern business world operates in the VUCA environment or reality; volatility and unpredictability are the only constants in it. It is challenging for entrepreneurs to predict the future, and the tested routines, proven habits, or the developed patterns of action no longer function properly, e.g., the logistic strategy of JIT does not fit the new rules of the business game and begins to be treated as a relic. From a business perspective, this new reality is profoundly changing how enterprises and supply chains operate, as well as how we approach supply chain resilience. As a result, we observe a picture of a highly volatile and unpredictable business environment in which vulnerable supply chains operate. The following research questions were asked in the paper: (1) What are the barriers to realizing the concept of Supply Chain Resilience in the reality of VUCA?; and (2) What can be the lead time for the Supply Chain Resilience in reality VUCA? The article presents the results of an expert study using the Delphi method. High-class experts from the scientific community were selected for the research. The results of the research allowed us to answer the research questions posed. Internal barriers to realizing a resilient supply chain in reality VUCA are listed. Based on the indications of experts, three scenarios have also been developed that relate to the speed of the expected lead time of a resilient supply chain, in fact, VUCA. Further research directions on the resilience of supply chains have also been marked out.
