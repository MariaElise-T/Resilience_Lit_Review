In recent years, family resilience has come to be seen as more of a process than an outcome. This process involves different family members who receive training during the course of family prevention programs. The Family Competence Program is a Spanish cultural adaptation of the Strengthening Families Program, which uses a Family Strengths and Resilience Scale. With this scale of 11 items, encompassing aspects such as communication, cohesion and family organization or parental skills, changes in family resilience were measured before and after the application of the program. The results point to positive changes. Potential links with family vulnerability were also tested, but the results of the study do not suggest any association between resilience and family vulnerability.
