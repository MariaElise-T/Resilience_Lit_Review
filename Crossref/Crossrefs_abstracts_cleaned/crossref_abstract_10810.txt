The compression-resilience performance of new metal-to-metal contact (MMC) gasket at different temperatures was studied by compression-resilience test, and the influences on sealing performance of gasket caused by internal pressure of medium and assembly stress were studied by sealing test. Then the influences on performance of gasket caused by internal pressure of medium, bolt pretightening force, and temperature were studied through finite element method of ANSYS. According to the results of test and numerical analysis, conclusions are as follows: The new MMC gasket has good high-temperature stability from results of tests at different temperatures. When the MMC occurs between flange and gasket, the contact stress of new MMC gasket is about 50â€‰MPa. When applying loads, the limiting ring of gasket is able to bear parts of bolt loads, and when reducing loads, its resilience can compensate loss of gasket stress. In this case, the stress on sealing surface of gasket remains stable so that the leakage rate can keep in a stable range. Because of its unique structure in design, the inner contact stress of new MMC gasket increases with the rise of internal pressure of medium so that in a certain range, the leakage rate changes gently, which shows that the gasket has a certain self-sealing ability. Besides, the new MMC gasket is able to adapt to high temperature and fluctuation of internal pressure of medium.
