Food waste reduction and security are the main concerns of agri-food supply chains, as more than thirty-three percent of global food production is wasted or lost due to mismanagement. The ongoing challenges, including resource scarcity, climate change, waste generation, etc., need immediate actions from stakeholders to develop resilient food supply chains. Previous studies explored food supply chains and their challenges, barriers, enablers, etc. Still, there needs to be more literature on the innovations in supply chains that can build resilient food chains to last long and compete in the post-pandemic scenario. Thus, studies are also required to explore supply chain innovations for the food sector. The current research employed a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) to assess the supply chain innovations that can develop resilient food supply chains. This study is a pioneer in using the SWARA application to evaluate supply chain innovation and identify the most preferred alternatives. The results from the SWARA show that ‘Business strategy innovations’ are the most significant innovations that can bring resiliency to the food supply chains, followed by ‘Technological innovations.’ The study provides insights for decision makers to understand the significant supply chain innovations to attain resilience in food chains and help the industry to survive and sustain in the long run.
