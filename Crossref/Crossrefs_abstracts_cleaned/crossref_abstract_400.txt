Background: Life satisfaction is a potentially important health-promoting factor for individuals with alcohol dependence. Addictions are often associated with a decrease in the quality of life due to multiple dysfunctions in the dimensions of health, family and work. Ego-resiliency is believed to be one of factors that contribute to life satisfaction and, consequently, motivation to undergo therapy and resume satisfactory social roles. Aim: The aim of the study was to identify relationships between resiliency and life satisfaction in alcohol-dependent individuals, as well as to assess the determinants of satisfaction in the context of resiliency components. Materials and methods: A total of 100 adults participated in the study: 60 alcoholdependent patients (Cloninger’s type II alcoholism) and 40 healthy controls. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) by Diener et al. was used to measure life satisfaction, and the Ego-Resiliency Scale, referred to as ER89-R12 (Block and Kremen), was used for resiliency. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient, multiple regression and Student’s t-test were used in the statistical analyses. Results: Ego-resiliency is positively correlated with life satisfaction (r = 0.333; p < 0.01). Optimal regulation (β = 0.452; p < 0.05), which is one of the components of resiliency, is particularly likely to have a beneficial effect on shaping like satisfaction in alcohol-dependent individuals. Conclusions: Ego-resiliency is positively correlated with life satisfaction. Increased ego-resiliency, optimal regulation in particular, is likely to translate into higher life satisfaction.
