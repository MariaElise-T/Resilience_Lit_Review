Autonomous cars recognize the surroundings through multiple sensors and make decisions to control the car in order to arrive at destination without driver's interventions. In such environment, if sensor data forgery occurs, it could lead to a big (critical) accident that could threaten the life of the driver. In the paper, a research on a way to get accurate driving information through sensor fusion algorithm that has resilience against data forgery and modulation will be discussed.
