 The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the concept of resilience and how it relates to the field of veterinary nursing. Resilience is defined as the ability of an individual to adjust to adversity, maintain equilibrium, retain a sense of control over their environment and continue to move on in a positive manner ( Jackson et al, 2007 ). Because of the challenges faced daily by veterinary nurses, including taking care of critically ill or dying patients, staff shortages, and emotional exhaustion, it is important to address the concept of resilience, at both an individual and organisational level, in order to maintain a healthy workforce.
