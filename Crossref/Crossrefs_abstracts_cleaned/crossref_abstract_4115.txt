Complex cyber-physical systems demand integrated solution approaches. The current work presents a multi-model approach for simulation-based digital twins as a formal and technological foundation for the analysis and improvement of resilient services. The given approach has several significant benefits including the possibility to conduct interactive simulations and experiments based on systems engineering principles, to share data across multiple data sources and storages, to manage operations in real-time, as well as to enable collaboration between the users in an integrated web platform. The proposal is illustrated on the use cases of secure telemedicine services and secure remote workplace.
