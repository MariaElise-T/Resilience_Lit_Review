Purpose:The purpose of this study was to review the evidence for addressing emotional resilience in the training of graduate students in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). As helping professionals, speech-language pathologists and audiologists face unique emotional challenges that can lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, and eventually possible career changes. At the same time, we also know that graduate students across the country, in all disciplines, are in the throes of a mental health crisis. Graduate students in CSD are, therefore, in need of targeted instruction on how to foster emotional resilience both to manage the stressors of graduate school and to ensure professional wellness and career longevity.Conclusions:While there is currently limited research evidence on how to effectively target emotional resilience for graduate students in CSD, existing research and guidance from studies in CSD and other helping professions can provide a framework to follow. The recent mental health challenges facing our nation, and graduate students more specifically, should be seen as both a call to action and an opportunity to elevate the depth of training provided beyond core knowledge and skills to include education on wellness, self-care, and emotional resilience to develop career-long habits.
