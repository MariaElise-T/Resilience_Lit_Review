This paper reviews the development, testing, and present day use of the venerable resilient furring channel, one of the most successful acoustical products invented. Billions of feet have been produced and ‘‘it’s still going.’’ Wall and floor/ceiling systems with resilient furring channels were, and still are, among the most practical techniques for improving the airborne and impact sound transmission characteristics of wood frame structures. Performance data on typical assemblies will be presented along with tips to maximize field performance.
