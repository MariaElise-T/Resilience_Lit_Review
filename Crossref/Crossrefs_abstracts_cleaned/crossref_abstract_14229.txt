 This article presents the validation of the Multidimensional Teachers’ Resilience Scale (MTRS) for Portuguese teachers and proposes a hierarchical model to represent teachers’ resilience. Participants were 334 Portuguese teachers from elementary to secondary school who responded to the MTRS and a global measure of teachers’ resilience. Confirmatory factor analysis provided acceptable fit for a 13-item solution distributed by four factors. Results support the hierarchical structure of teachers’ resilience. Descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, and correlation analysis between the MTRS global score and the global measure of teachers’ resilience suggest that the MTRS is a valid and reliable instrument to assess teachers’ resilience.
