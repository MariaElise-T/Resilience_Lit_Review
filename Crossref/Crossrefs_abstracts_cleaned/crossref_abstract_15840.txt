AbstractThe current study explored the influences of social stress and resilience on the relation between psychopathy‐linked personality characteristics (i.e., narcissism, dimensions of CU traits) and aggression with the expectation that social stress would exacerbate the relation, whereas resilience would mitigate it. In a sample of 154 at‐risk adolescents (ages 16–18; 84% male), contrary to expectations, high social stress attenuated the relations of narcissism and callousness with aggression. Self‐reported resilience attenuated the relation between callousness and aggression. The implications for understanding the role that these moderators might play in the association between adolescent psychopathic tendencies, particularly callousness, and aggression are discussed.
