If students do not have good resilience, it will be difficult to follow the learning  process  and  live  a  daily  life  that  is  felt  to  be  unsatisfactory. Resilience does not only refer to negative mental health, but also refers to how an individual is able to develop their potential and abilities optimally, as individuals who function both physically, emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of self compassion and grit on  student  resilience  during  a  pandemic.  The  method  used  is  descriptive quantitative. The  results  concluded  that  the  variables  of  grit  and  self-compassion affect  either  partially  or simultaneously  the  resilience  of students during Covid 19  pandemic.
