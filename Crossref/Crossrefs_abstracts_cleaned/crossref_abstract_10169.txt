Resilience of school going adolescent girls has always been influenced by healthy and nurturing family and school life. Research studies reveal how extrinsic protective factors at home and school become pivotal in healthy development of adolescent girls who are known to be sensitive to the social support system they live in. The present study was therefore conducted with the purpose to examine the role of home and school environment of school going adolescent girls in a semi-urban town of India. The study more specifically explores and identifies which protective factors are responsible for higher levels of resilience in this population. Standardized measures of resilience, home environment and school environment were administered to a sample of 130 school going girls in their adolescent phase. Correlations computed and regression analyses conducted revealed positive significant relationship between resilience and home and school protective factors.
