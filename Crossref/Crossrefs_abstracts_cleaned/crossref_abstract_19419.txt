ABSTRACT  Objectives: to analyze the validity of the Resilience at Work Scale (RAW Scale - Brazil), 25 and 20-item versions, based on its internal structure (dimensional and correlation), with professors and health workers from a public university in southern Brazil.  Methods: methodological study, developed in 2018, with 526 participants. For psychometric tests, the following were used: Confirmatory Factor Analysis; composite reliability, and convergent validity against the Engagement at work; Occupational self-efficacy; Overall resilience; General Health Questionnaire; and Social support at work scales.  Results: both versions had factor loadings > 0.30, adequate fit indices and satisfactory composite reliability. In both versions, strong and direct correlations with general Resilience and Self-efficacy were evidenced; moderate and direct with social Engagement and Support; and moderate and inverse with General Health.  Conclusions: the RAW Scale 25 and 20 - Brazil meets the validity requirements with potential for assessing resilience at work within the studied context.
