The dynamics of the systems present in the Amazon require a detailed view of the aspects involving human actions and their consequent interactions with the forest. The impacts caused by this relationship have been the subject of numerous studies aimed at understanding the responsiveness to these impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities of the environment subject to risk factors. The general goal of this paper is to conduct a theoretical and conceptual study on resilience in the face of socioenvironmental impacts in the Brazilian Western Amazon. The specific goals are to contextualize the concepts of situational resilience in the face of environmental impacts, to address the main definitions of environmental impacts in the Amazon, and analyze the approach in the face of the Amazon environmental heritage. Regarding the problem, the following question was proposed: how is resilience characterized in the face of social and environmental impacts? In order to answer this question, a theoretical-conceptual review based on the Contingency Theory was conducted to support the conclusions. In order to reach this goal, we sought the conceptualization of resilience in the face of environmental impacts, the search for the main definitions of environmental impacts in the Brazilian Amazon and some concepts about the Amazonian environmental heritage in a qualitative approach by collecting data through qualitative research for further analysis of the problem and literature review, in order to build knowledge for the theoretical foundation using the Contingency Theory, which springs from environmental conditions to actions that minimize the impacts of human action.
