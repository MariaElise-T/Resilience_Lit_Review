In the current scenario where urban areas are exposed to extreme climate phenomena, resilience of cities and buildings becomes fundamental. Thus, not only defensive, traditional actions, but also alternative solutions towards resilience need to be implemented. Amphibious and floating houses, still not investigated in literature, allow the building to adapt to water presence due to their specific construction and technical properties. Here, we consider such buildingsâ€™ typologies under the construction and thermal-energy performance lenses, by means of yearly dynamic energy simulations.
