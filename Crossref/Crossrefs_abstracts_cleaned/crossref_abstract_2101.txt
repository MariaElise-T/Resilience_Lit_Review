This work reports on the development of a simple model to explain the effects of adding resilient channels to a rigid double-leaf wall or floor system. The surface layers mounted on resilient channels are treated as a vibration isolator with a fundamental resonance frequency determined by the combination of the stiffness of the resilient channels and the stiffness of the air cavity along with the masses of the surface layers. The effective stiffness of various common forms of resilient channels is determined to be approximately equivalent to that of a 160-mm air cavity. The damping of constructions including resilient channels and cavities with sound-absorbing material is found to vary with cavity depth. The model does not attempt to explain high-frequency transmission through the resilient supports but does permit the optimization of the low-frequency performance of double-leaf constructions with resilient channels. It also demonstrates that the practical range of improvements is limited.
