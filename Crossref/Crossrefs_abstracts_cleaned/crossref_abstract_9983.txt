Modern society requires that structures exhibit greater levels of resilience, especially under earthquakes. The seismic resilience of buildings is thus gaining increased attention as a particular, beyond-code approach. Seismically retrofitted buildings behave satisfactorily under expected earthquake scenarios; however, this does not guarantee operativity after a seismic event. This study critically reviews several methods currently available in the literature that quantify the seismic resilience level of buildings from different perspectives. An existing reinforced concrete school building, retrofitted according to four distinct strategies, is first evaluated in terms of seismic resilience levels. The overview and critical analysis of available resilience assessment frameworks determine the most suitable parameters to measure the seismic resilience for buildings. Subsequently, this metric is incorporated as an additional decision variable into an integrated seismic and energy retrofitting set of strategies. A multicriteria decision-making analysis is performed to select the optimally combined seismic and energy retrofitting alternative under social, technical, environmental evaluation, and seismic resilience aspects. We show how resilience impacts the preference for integrated seismic and energy retrofitting strategies, especially when this metric is considered as an annualized expected value.
