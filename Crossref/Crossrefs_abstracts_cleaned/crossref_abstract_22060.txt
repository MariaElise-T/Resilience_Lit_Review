Objectives To synthesize interventions designed to enhance resilience in family caregivers (FCs). Methods Electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus, were searched using index and keyword methods for articles published before January 2020. The review process followed the PRISMA review guidelines. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results Six studies (seven articles) were included in this review. Quantitative evidence supports the benefits of psychoeducation, mindfulness-based intervention, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention but not expressive writing in improving in FCs’ resilience. Four of the six included studies were randomized controlled trials. All included studies only met 40% to 60% of the MMAT criteria, indicating low to moderate levels of study quality. Conclusion This review showed emerging evidence that psychoeducation, mindfulness-based intervention, and CBT-based intervention may improve caregiver resilience. However, it remains unclear which intervention and what dosage is the most effective in promoting FCs’ resilience. Due to the small number of relevant studies and a low-to-moderate level of overall study quality, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to strengthen the current limited evidence base for FC resilience interventions.
