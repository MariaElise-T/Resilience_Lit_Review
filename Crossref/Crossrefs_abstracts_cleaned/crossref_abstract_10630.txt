This study aims to analyze the role of urban resilience in residents’ subjective happiness in China. Results show that the overall urban resilience is a critical factor in improving residents’ subjective happiness, and each sub-class resilience index of cities in the ecological, social, infrastructure, and economic aspects shows positive and significant correlations with residents’ subjective happiness. Heterogeneous results show that the effect of urban resilience is greater for residents with higher education or living in cities with larger population size. The mechanism results show that four possible channels are confirmed. The rise of urban resilience raises residents’ subjective happiness through increasing residents’ income or consumption, improving their health status, and raising their social trust or social integration. The main conclusion drawn from the empirical analysis is that raising urban resilience is an effective strategy to strengthen residents’ subjective happiness.
