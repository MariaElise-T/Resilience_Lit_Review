The most important lesson Anita Barker gleaned from leading her athletics department through the changes and challenges brought on by the COVID‐19 crisis actually presented itself as a reinforcement of what she already knew. “College athletics teaches us invaluable life skills: the ability to respond quickly to adversity, the need to be prepared, resourcefulness, and resiliency. These qualities have never been more important than during this crisis,” said Barker, Director of Athletics at California State University, Chico, and a recipient of the 2018–19 Under Armour AD of the Year Awards for Division II.
