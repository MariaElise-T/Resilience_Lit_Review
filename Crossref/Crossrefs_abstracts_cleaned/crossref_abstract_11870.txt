Objective: The purpose of this study is to compile a synthesis of the application of leadership in building organizational resilience, especially when the organization faces a crisis or difficulty.
Design/Methods/Approach: The approach used is a literature review, with a systematic search from a database of scientific journals indexed by SCOPUS as an indexing organization for reputable research journals. Selected journals that match the theme will be reviewed and data synthesized.

Furthermore, this research also identified the stages of the process and their mechanisms. From the results of this study, there are several opportunities for future research.
Originality: This research generates a literature review on building organizational resilience with a leadership perspective and its synthesis model.
Practical/Policy implication (optional): This research provides a more comprehensive understanding of how resilience is fostered in organizations and best practices regarding the role of leaders in building organizational resilience.
