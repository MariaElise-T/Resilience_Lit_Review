The low resilience of students can be seen from their inability to face challenges and difficulties in the learning process. The lack of application of learning models that involve problem-solving results in students complaining when faced with difficult material and questions. As well as students refuse when given project-based assignments. This study aimed to examine the effect of the Project Based Learning (PjBL) learning model on students' resilience. The research method is quantitative with Quasi-Experimental Design by applying the PjBL learning model to the Experiment class and not applying the PjBL model to the control class. The study population consisted of 160 people, with a sample of 34 people for the experimental class and 36 for the control class. Collecting data with a non-test is a questionnaire, and the instrument is a questionnaire. The data analysis techniques are descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test). The results of testing the hypothesis showed a significant effect of the PjBL model on students' resilience. It was concluded that the PjBL model could improve the resilience of students.
