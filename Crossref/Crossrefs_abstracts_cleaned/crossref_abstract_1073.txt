The article focuses on the benefits and limits of volunteering of farmers and scientists for the transformation toward climate-resilient agriculture. Being one of the most affected countries by the consequences of climate change, the need for climate-resilient practices and technologies in the Philippines seems high. The risks and inefficiency of activism and legal means lead to the increased relevance of looking at the potential of volunteer involvement of civil society. Qualitative interviews with farmers, scientists, and employees of the MASIPAG network were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The main findings were that, despite mainly politically induced challenges, voluntary farmer-to-farmer training and farmer-scientist cooperation could be seen as essential means to foster innovations and practices relevant to climate change resilient agriculture.
