In the following pages the basic aspects of this term are going to be examined so that not only the significance of Resilience in our everyday lives, but also the factors that affect someone&rsquo;s ability to bounce back and keep making progress in many aspects of life can be understood despite the adversities that may interfere. The above mentioned are widely known as protective and risk factors depending on the way they affect somebody&rsquo;s life. Another aspect that is going to be briefly analyzed is the role of school and teacher in students&rsquo; resilience- how this role can help students maintain their psychosocial and learning progress.
