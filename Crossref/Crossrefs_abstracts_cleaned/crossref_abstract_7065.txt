Improving the resilience of enterprise safety production is one of the important ways to deal with the frequency of safety accidents. Based on the definition of enterprise safety production resilience, we fully consider the impacts of recovery resilience, self-organizing resilience, and learning resilience as the three dimensions of enterprise safety production resilience. We build a back propagation (BP) neural network model that analyzes the main factors of enterprise safety production resilience using the results of gray relational analysis as an input that can assess the resilience of enterprise safety production and provide a valuable reference for the improvement of an enterpriseâ€™s safety production level. The results show that the resilience of production safety obviously increased after the Chinese enterprises with low resilience (as predicted by the model) adopted the corresponding early warning methods. The gray relational degree analysis method can incorporate well the variables for the establishment of the BP neural network prediction model.
