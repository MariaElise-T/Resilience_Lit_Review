ABSTRACTIntroductionCross‐sectional studies offer inadequate understandings of adolescent resilience. Nevertheless, few longitudinal studies account for the resilience of school‐attending adolescents challenged by the structural disadvantages associated with South African township residence. This prompts two questions: (i) Do the same (or different) resilience‐enabling resources inform township‐dwelling, school‐attending adolescents' resilience accounts when they self‐explain their resilience at two distinct points in time? (ii) Which resilience‐enabling resources, if any, become significantly more (or less) salient over time and how do township‐dwelling, school‐attending adolescents explain the resilience‐enabling value of these resources?MethodsTo answer the aforementioned, we conducted a longitudinal qualitative study with 140, township‐dwelling, school‐attending, South African adolescents (62.1% girls; mean age: 13.8 years [Time 1]; 15.8 years [Time 2]). They completed a draw‐and‐write activity. This generated visual and narrative data that we analysed using multiple methods (content analyses, chi square tests of frequency counts, and thematic analysis).ResultsA comparison of school‐attending adolescents' accounts of their resilience at two points in time revealed the longevity of nine, generic resilience‐enabling resources. A comparison of how frequently adolescents reported these resources at Time 1 and 2 showed significant increases for education, faith‐based supports, and peer support. A comparison of adolescents' reasons for identifying these three resources showed that education promises an improved future, while all three facilitate respite from hardship and/or mastery over current challenges.ConclusionThe salience of education, faith‐based supports, and peer support can be explained using developmental, contextual and cultural perspectives. This explanation prompts pragmatic and cautionary lessons for resilience advocates.
