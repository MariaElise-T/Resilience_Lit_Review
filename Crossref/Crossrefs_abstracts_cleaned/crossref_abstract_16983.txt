The paper aims to revisit the business resilience concept in the specific case of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine firm resilience factors in ten European and Mediterranean countries. Through a cross-sectional study of a sample of 3,722 firms in all industries, we analyze how firms have survived the crisis. By constructing a multidimensional index identifying resilient companies, the paper contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature and defines a methodology that assesses a firmâ€™s resilience to promote a business strategy that encourages the growth process and develops new aptitudes to cope with future crises.
