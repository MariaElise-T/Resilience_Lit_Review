AbstractBackgroundPoor single mothers in Israel are stigmatized in public discourse as lazy and relying on the taxpayers' money yet are seldom given the opportunity to access higher education to achieve economic independence.ObjectivesThis work sought to find (a) the sources of empowerment and resilient self‐efficacy motivating poor single mothers to pursue a degree and (b) examine the transformative growth of mothers and children in the process of acquiring knowledge.Participants and settingsTwelve poor single mothers enrolled in the Katzir antipoverty program who were about to graduate.MethodsIn‐depth private interviews and content analysis examined the similarities among these women's experiences.ResultsMotivations to pursue a bachelor's degree included mothers' desire to prove to themselves that they could complete a degree and secure a better future for their children. Although initially overwhelmed, they developed resilient self‐efficacy as they passed their exams and surmounted financial and other crises related to their children's health and lack of childcare. Relationships with their children had improved, and by sharing their progress and achievements with their children, they had become a proud team, motivating each other to achieve.ConclusionGiven the centrality of children well‐being in mothers' motivation to study and complete a degree, children's needs for subsidized daycare and after‐school programs cannot be ignored.ImplicationsTwo‐generation programs that assist mothers to pursue a degree while providing daycare and after‐school programs for children must be implemented to offer fair opportunities for poor single mothers in Israel to complete a bachelor's degree.
