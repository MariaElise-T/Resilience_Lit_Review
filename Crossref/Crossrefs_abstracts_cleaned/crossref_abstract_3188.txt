AbstractThe COVID‐19 experience has sharpened debates about democracy's future worldwide. In reflecting on these debates, this paper does three things. First, it assesses how resilient democracy has been in the COVID‐19 emergency. Second, it examines the effect the pandemic has had on the pre‐existing trends in democratic politics. And third, it suggests ways in which the COVID‐19 crisis both requires and possibly opens the door to democratic rejuvenation.
