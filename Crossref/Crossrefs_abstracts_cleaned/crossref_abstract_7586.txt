Urban public space is now getting scarce and becoming an important element in the residential or housing environment. The existence of public space will meet the needs for social interaction, economic and cultural phenomena. Genteng Candirejo, which is one of the kampongs in Surabaya, has its uniqueness in the utilization of its public space by cultivating herbs and hydroponics in an open public space (alley/yard), developing the making of traditional snacks which are carried out together in closed public space (living room or hall). This study aims to examine the resilience of the residents in Genteng Candirejo on space (character and function of space) and activities carried out by the residents in public spaces in supporting the social, economic, and cultural community, with the challenges of limited public space. With the method of field observation and interviews, this study shows resilience to the shape, surface/appearance, and space (characteristic and function of the space) both in open and closed public spaces in Genteng Candirejo shown by the improvement of the environment quality, the creation of greening, the beauty of the surrounding environment which has a visual aesthetic value, and an increase in income for the community with the growth of small and medium enterprises (UKM). That is in line with the concept of green and clean launched by the Surabaya city government.
