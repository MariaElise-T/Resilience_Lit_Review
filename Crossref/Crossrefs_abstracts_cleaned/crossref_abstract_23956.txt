AbstractBackgroundIn Canada, heterosexual African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) men tend to suffer a disproportionate burden of HIV. Consequently, studies have examined the underlying contributors to this disparity through the nexus of behavioral and structural factors. While findings from these studies have been helpful, their use of deficit and risk models only furthers our knowledge of why ACB men are more vulnerable to HIV infection. Thus far, there is a dearth of knowledge on how heterosexual ACB men mobilize protective assets to promote their resilience against HIV infection.MethodsAs part of a larger Ontario-based project called weSpeak, this study examined how ACB men acquire protective assets to build their resilience to reduce their HIV vulnerability. We analyzed three focus group discussions (n = 17) and 13 in-depth interviews conducted with ACB men using NVivo and a mixed inductive-deductive thematic analyses approach.ResultsThe findings show that ACB men mostly relied on personal coping strategies, including sexual abstinence, to build resilience against HIV. Interpersonal resources such as family, friends, and religious communities also played an important role in constructing ACB men’s resilience. ACB men bemoaned their lack of access to essential institutional resources, such as health services, that are important in managing HIV adversity.ConclusionBased on these findings, there is an urgent need for HIV policy stakeholders, including service providers, to engage the ACB community in the design of intervention programs. Additionally, addressing the socioeconomic disadvantages faced by ACB communities will increase the capacity of ACB men to develop resilience against HIV.
