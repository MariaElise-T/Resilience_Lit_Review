ABSTRACT:
With about one-third of nurses having expressed an intention to leave the profession or change jobs in 2022, the effects of nursing job stress are evident. For nurses to continue to provide care in high stress, they must practice self-compassion and build resilience. The importance of resilience education and self-compassion for nurses and in nursing education is discussed from a Christian perspective, along with self-care strategies using the R.E.S.T. (Relationship, Exercise, Self-Compassion, Transformative Thinking) framework. Strategies for building resilience for both individuals and organizations are offered.
