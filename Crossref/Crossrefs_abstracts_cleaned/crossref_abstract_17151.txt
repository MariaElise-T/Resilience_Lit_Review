The global outbreak of COVID-19 has presented unparalleled difficulties for societies around the globe, necessitating the development of comprehensive programmes for recovery and the implementation of adaptive governance measures. The present study work explores the use of mathematical modelling as a means to comprehend the intricacies of social resilience in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focuses on the examination of recovery techniques and their implications for adaptive governance. It employs diverse mathematical methodologies to provide valuable insights into effectively traversing the intricate terrain of recovery. Utilising a multidisciplinary framework, the present study not only examines the quantitative dimensions of recovery, but also takes into account the complex socio-cultural, economic, and psychological variables that shape the trajectory towards resilience. Our objective is to get a full comprehension of the post-COVID healing process by combining mathematical models with qualitative observations. The examination of recovery pathways is enhanced by an assessment of possible policy solutions, emphasising the customization of adaptive governance to changing conditions. By using this comprehensive methodology, our aim is to provide policymakers with a resilient framework for formulating recovery plans that are both efficacious and flexible in response to the changing demands of societies as they traverse the unexplored terrain of the post-pandemic era.
