Research on resilience in the workplace is currently limited by at least two issues: an inconsistent documentation and choice of the stress-producing events and a singular construct of what constitutes resilience (Britt, Shen, Sinclair, Grossman, & Klieger, 2016). This commentary summarizes some recent experimental research that was possibly too new to have been included in the review and that offers some insights to both concerns. The research is predicated on a theoretical model that explains the role of resilience in either work-related or clinical outcomes and the temporal dynamics of work performance.
