The study discusses adaptation practices and the resilience of smallholder farmers to agriculture productivity. The study sampled 248 women smallholder farmers in the study communities. Purposive sampling techniques were used to gather data from women smallholder farmers. The findings indicate that drought, pest and disease infestation, reduced rainfall, and flooding were climate change occurrences that affect crop yields as farmers record low productive output. The findings also indicate that mixed cropping, mixed farming, integrated soil fertility management and forecasting were adaptation practices. Findings further show that livelihood diversification, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), dry season gardening and improved variety were also the major resilience strategies among women smallholder farmers. The study recommends that the Ministry of Food and Agriculture should prioritize a dry season gardening support scheme for women smallholder farmers to sustain their adaptative capacity to climate change; the Nabdam District Assembly should create an enabling environment for women smallholder farmers to effectively maximum livelihood diversification; and International Non- Governmental Organization (INGO) including Action Aid Ghana (AAG) should scale-up support to women smallholder farmers in their intervention programs focusing on dry season gardening.
