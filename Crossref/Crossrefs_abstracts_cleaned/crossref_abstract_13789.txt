PurposeThe purpose of this study is to discern the role of entrepreneurial leadership (EL) – a dynamic capability – in increasing supply chain performance (SCP), through building supply chain resilience (SCR). The study further suggests that the presence of supply chain orientation (SCO) within a firm will enhance the relationship between EL and SCR.Design/methodology/approachDynamic capabilities view is used to develop the hypotheses and a survey method is used to collect data from manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The hypothesized model is tested using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThe results in general confirm the hypothesized model. The findings suggest that SCR mediates the relationship between EL and SCP. The results also confirm that SCO moderates the relationship between EL and SCR.Originality/valueThis paper contributes by studying the pivotal role of EL in building SCR and sustaining a competitive advantage in an uncertain environment.
