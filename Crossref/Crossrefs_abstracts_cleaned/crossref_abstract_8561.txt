Abstract The study aims to refine the concept of resilient schools. It is based on a document and content analysis of 116 articles and 38 internal documents from Portuguese border schools. The focus on these schools brings attention to contextual factors, being useful to think on challenges of peripheral schools worldwide. Articles’ findings indicated the prevalence of an individualistic approach to resilience. Results of educational projects of border region schools highlighted local specificities, suggesting the relevance of an ecological approach to conceptualize resilient schools. This concept contributes to a situated understanding of a combination of factors that may improve schools’ organisation and dynamics particularly in challenging settings.
