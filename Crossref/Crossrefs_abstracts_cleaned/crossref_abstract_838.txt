PurposeThe purpose of this study was to address calls for and test efficacy of an app based, short term resilience intervention for individual benefit.Design/methodology/approachThree independent samples of participants were assessed to determine the efficacy of an employee focused resilience intervention.

Study 3 utilizes random assignment of groups (treatment and control) to determine invention results on resilience and individual psychological well-being.FindingsEvidence suggests employees in the experimental group reported higher levels of resilience and psychological well-being as a result of the intervention. Further, the authors found no significant changes in resilience or psychological well-being amongst employees in the control group suggesting the intervention induced the effect.Originality/valuePrevious research attempting resilience interventions have been long, cumbersome and expensive for organizations. Basing the authorsâ€™ method on previous research regarded as micro interventions, this intervention is individualized, flexible and very cost effective for organizational application.
