PurposeThis study aims to identify the enablers of supply chain resilience (SCR) through a literature review and expert panel input in the context of Pakistan and the post-pandemic era. This study also aims to categorize and rank the identified enablers using expert panel input.Design/methodology/approachA review of the extant literature was conducted to investigate and identify the factors that contribute to SCR. The relative ranking of the enablers was carried out by a group of industry and academic experts. The expert panel was convened to compare the main categories and each enabler in pairs and to score the enablers using triangular fuzzy numbers.FindingsThis study identified 16 critical SCR enablers. Using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), these enablers were divided into three groups and analyzed. The results show that financial enablers, technology enablers and then social enablers are prioritized when it comes to SCR in emerging markets. The robustness of the ranking of enablers is tested through sensitivity analysis.Practical implicationsThe results shall be helpful for policymakers and managers to understand the important enablers and also help allocate resources to important enablers. Managers will be able to formulate strategies to achieve SCR in an uncertain environment.Originality/valueThis is one of the first attempts to identify and rank the enablers of SCR in an emerging economy context.
