AbstractAn organisation's sustainability performance is influenced by its capabilities (skills, resources and competences) which in turn affects the performance of its entire supply chain. However, recent research has not sufficiently explored the convergence of dynamic capabilities, circular economy, resilience and Industry 4.0 concepts for manufacturing supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to identify how dynamic capabilities theory can enable circular and resilient supply chains. A qualitative research process was deployed in three stages: literature review, European project and nine expert interviews. Key investigative variables were used to identify capabilities used in manufacturing, and five research propositions were developed to address the gaps found in literature. The empirical data helped reveal challenges to circular economy implementation and validate the literature findings. The main contributions include a dynamic capabilities model, a causal relationship model and five research propositions for circular economy implementation.
