Abstract
This study examined whether different humor styles (adaptive vs. maladaptive) mediate the relationship between early maladaptive schemas (EMS) and current levels of resilience. Results from a sample of 511 college students indicated that individuals endorsing EMS were significantly more likely to engage in maladaptive humor and significantly less likely to engage in adaptive humor, both of which predicted decreased resilience. Interestingly, affiliative, self-enhancing, and aggressive humor styles each significantly partially mediated the relationship between EMS and resilience. The partial mediation suggests that lower levels of affiliative and self-enhancing humor and higher levels of aggressive humor may be mechanisms by which EMS influences resiliency. To the extent that clinical interventions can incorporate and explore oneâ€™s awareness of their usage of humor, individuals with maladaptive humor styles, particularly those endorsing EMS, may experience benefits from re-focusing on adaptive humor styles. This study highlights the clinical importance of assessing for and focusing on distinct humor styles when promoting overall wellness.
