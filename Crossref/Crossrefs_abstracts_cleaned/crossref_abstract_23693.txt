This study was conducted to verify the multi-mediating effect of intrinsic enlistment motivationand resilience in the relationship between soldiers’ military life stress and military lifeadjustment. To this end, a survey was conducted on 339 soldiers, and the structuralrelationships and mediating effects between variables were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 and AMOS21.0. The summary of the research results as follows. First, military life adjustment, intrinsicenlistment motivation, and resilience showed a significant positive correlation reciprocally, andall three variables showed a significant negative correlation with military life stress. Second, thevalidity of the measurement model was acqiured through confirmatory factor analysis, and thefitness of the research model was confirmed through structural equation model verification. Third, military life stress of soldiers’ negatively effect on their military life adjustment, and it wasfound that both intrinsic military motivation and resilience partially mediated this. Fourth, as aresult of analyzing the phantom variable, the mediating effect of resilience was relatively large. Along with the discussions of thoese results, limitations and guidances for follow-up studieswere presented.
