<p>A history of interaction between traditional social communities and the environment forms a relationship that can be understood by examining these interactions through the theory of complex systems. The process of interaction not only develops knowledge applicable to traditional agriculture or hunting and gathering but also promotes conservation practices. This paper examines the socio-ecological system established between the traditional inhabitants of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and its ecosystem. It establishes theoretical foundations through literature review of topics such as learning and knowledge development, resilience and conservation management of socioecological systems. Traditional indigenous communities of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta continually adapt and learn from their environment reinforcing their conservation customs. Further analysis of the social-environment relationship elicits a description of a robust traditional socio-ecological system. A system resilient to outside pressures and environmental change through active conservation.</p>
