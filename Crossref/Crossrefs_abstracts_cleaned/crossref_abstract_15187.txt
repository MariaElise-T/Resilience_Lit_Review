Background. In 2020 the global community faced a serious unexpected challenge  COVID-19. Fighting the aggressive spread of the coronavirus required rapid reconfiguration of the Russian healthcare system, while exposing its weak spots and pressure points. Critical evaluation of the Russian healthcare systems resilience to crises offers new perspectives on the most effective management and organizational solutions for resolving this crisis. Research objective. The main goal of this study is to make a significant long-term contribution to the Russian healthcare system by developing a set of recommendations for increasing the systems sustainability and resilience to crises. Methods. For this study, specialists developed a framework that includes a set of questions in the 1) domains of governance, 2) financing, 3) workforce, 4) medicines and technology and 5) service delivery, which align closely with the well-recognised WHO health system building blocks. In each domain, a series of targeted questions concerned both sustainability and resilience. Findings. The main areas of work for increasing the Russian healthcare systems sustainability and resilience to crises include: adapting the existing legislative framework to the current crisis, and to prepare it for similar crises in the future; increasing healthcare funding; improving the image of the medical profession; promoting healthcare digitalization; reducing the pressure on the inpatient and emergency care services by strengthening preventive and rehabilitative care services. Conclusion. The synthesis and analysis of materials relevant to understanding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Russian healthcare system, supplemented by expert assessments and examples drawn from practice, allowed the authors to compile a list of recommendations for ensuring the healthcare systems sustainability and resilience to future crises. This list offers potential for healthcare industry development.
