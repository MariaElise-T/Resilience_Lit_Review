Resilience practice is a place-based activity. This study incorporates the notion of “Transitional Progress” as an available scoping tool pin-pointing the human-habitat domain; the critical human resilience build-up can be identified by the site-specific and locally adapted practice as the residents’ perception and interaction within the local geographical character are examined. The assessment framework is proposed as a measurable process, followed by an adaptive cycle valuation performed for each of the scales at the different transitional stages. This resilience varies from the degree and time exposed to flood and the resident’s respective responses regarding people, community, and place; accordingly, the semi-structured interview documented respondents’ self-evaluation from the Peitou Plateau in Taipei. The study ascertained that in the face of climate risks: (1) adaptive measures aided and enhanced the information gathered for risk impact is based on the residents’ perception of the habitat and human domain (2) adaptive capacity assessment is an effective mean in understanding residents’ mitigation will and confidence, and (3) community ability to reflect on past actual time scenario. Most importantly, the assessment framework contributes to understanding local adaptation practice and contributes toward the sustainability of the urbanity.
