Abstract
There is a lack of empirical evidence on self-reported discrimination and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). Further, the mechanism linking the two constructs is not well understood. This study aimed to examine the relationship between self-reported discrimination and OHRQoL and investigate resilience as a mediator in such a relationship among foreign-born older Chinese Americans. Data came from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago collected between 2017 and 2019. The working sample included 3,054 foreign-born Chinese Americans (60+ years of age). Mediation analysis was conducted to examine the direct and indirect pathways towards OHRQoL. Self-reported discrimination was directly and indirectly associated with poorer OHRQoL. Resilience mediated the relationship between self-reported discrimination and OHRQoL. Specifically, individuals experienced discrimination reported weaker resilience, and subsequently, reported poorer OHRQoL. Findings illustrate the importance of studying self-reported discrimination in relation to OHRQoL and further identify resilience as an intermediary pathway to promote OHRQoL.
