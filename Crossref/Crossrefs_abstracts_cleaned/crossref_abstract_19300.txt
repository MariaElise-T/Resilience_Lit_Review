Abstract. Taking the lessons from the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) occurred in March 2011, the nuclear-reliant energy policy in Fukushima Prefecture has been transformed to other energy (fossil fuel, renewable energy) to make their energy system with better resilience toward the future disaster. As the increased concern on the Global Warming, Fukushima Prefecture made more efforts on the promotions of the renewable energy than the fossil fuel power. Nine years has passed since the GEJE, however, the spatial variation of the energy supply facilities is not clarified and the resilience of its energy system has not been evaluated. Therefore, this study focused on spatial analysis on these energy supply facilities before and after the GEJE and discussing the energy resilience in Fukushima Prefecture toward future disasters or climate events. This approach will be helpful for policy makers to spatiotemporally evaluate the sustainable development on the energy system.
