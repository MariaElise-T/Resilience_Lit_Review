IntroductionThe health and well-being of Aboriginal Australians is inextricably linked to culture and Country. Our study challenges deficit approaches to health inequities by seeking to examine how cultural connection, practice and resilience among Aboriginal peoples through participation in ‘cultural camps’ held on sites of cultural significance promotes health and well-being.Methods and analysisThe study will be undertaken in close collaboration and under the governance of traditional cultural knowledge holders from Yuwaalaraay, Gamilaraay and Yuin nation groups in New South Wales, Australia. Three cultural camps will be facilitated, where participants (n=105) will engage in activities that foster a connection to culture and cultural landscapes. A survey assessing connection to culture, access to cultural resources, resilience, self-rated health and quality of life will be administered to participants pre-camp and post-camp participation, and to a comparative group of Aboriginal adults who do not attend the camp (n=105). Twenty participants at each camp (n=60) will be invited to participate in a yarning circle to explore cultural health, well-being and resilience. Quantitative analysis will use independent samples’ t-tests or χ2analyses to compare camp and non-camp groups, and linear regression models to determine the impact of camp attendance. Qualitative analysis will apply inductive coding to data, which will be used to identify connections between coded concepts across the whole data set, and explore phenomenological aspects. Results will be used to collaboratively develop a ‘Model of Cultural Health’ that will be refined through a Delphi process with experts, stakeholders and policymakers.Ethics and disseminationThe study has ethics approval from the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (#1851/21). Findings will be disseminated through a combination of peer-reviewed articles, media communication, policy briefs, presentations and summary documents to stakeholders.
