Understanding that disruptions can be devastating, the ability of supply chains to return, as quickly as possible, to their normal state, after disruptions, has been considered as important as optimizing their flows. According to the literature, companies must develop capabilities and invest in risk management to improve their supply chain resilience, however almost nothing has been investigated about the role of the analytical orientation for those purposes. Assuming that analytical orientation is essential for supply chains to recover from interruptions, this theoretical essay aimed at proposing its inclusion in an initial supply chain resilience model, based on literature review. As a contribution, this paper aims at presenting a model that will enlarge the discussion about this theme, which can be empirically tested in a future research.
