The subgrade soil stiffness, which depends on the in-situ moisture content and soil index characteristics, is a key factor in pavement rutting. Due to variations in the compaction process used during construction and seasonal changes, the subgrade soil moisture content may deviate from the desired condition. The resilient modulus (MR), an important parameter of the Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) pavement design process, is used to specify the subgrade soil stiffness. Repeated load triaxial tests, which can be challenging and time-consuming to execute, are often used to determine MR. As a result, correlations between MR and more accessible stiffness metrics and index qualities are frequently used. California bearing ratio (CBR) and repeated load triaxial tests were carried out in this investigation. Soil specimens were fabricated at moisture levels that were both above and below the optimum moisture content (wopt). The results of the two tests were correlated, and statistical models were created to correlate the parameters of the generalized constitutive resilient modulus model with the characteristics of the soil index. Additionally, utilizing the MR found for subgrade soils compacted at wopt and ±2%wopt, pavement rutting was analyzed for three base layer types. The results demonstrated that a laboratory-measured MR (MR(Lab)) decreases as the moisture content increases. Specimens compacted at −2%wopt showed higher MR(Lab) than specimens compacted at wopt. Specimens compacted at +2%wopt showed lower MR(Lab) than specimens compacted at wopt. Results also indicated that the MR(Lab) predicted higher pavement rutting compared to field measured MR (MR(Lab)). If a stabilized aggregate foundation layer was employed instead of an untreated granular base, subgrade soil moisture condition showed a significant impact on rutting.
