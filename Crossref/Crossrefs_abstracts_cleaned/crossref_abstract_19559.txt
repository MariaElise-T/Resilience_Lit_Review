It is projected that extreme drought events will become more frequent and more severe across many regions of the globe by the end of the 21st century. Despite the substantial efforts that have been made to explore the impacts of droughts on terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of the response of diverse ecosystems, including resistance and resilience, remains unclear. A total of 16 site years of eddy covariance-based carbon flux data were used to reveal the different responses of forest and grassland ecosystems to two extreme summer droughts. We found that the carbon fluxes of the forest, namely gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and the net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with a single peak. However, GPP and NEE of grassland showed multiple peaks owing to hay harvesting throughout one year. Meanwhile, all climate factors jointly affected the seasonal dynamics in the NEE of the forest, whereas solar radiation only dominated the variability in the NEE of grassland. Moreover, the optimal response relationship was quadratic between the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the NEE, with the thresholds being 5.46 and 5.84 for forest and grassland, respectively. Owing to the large increase in VPD during the droughts of 2003 and 2018, the carbon sequestration of forest and grassland reduced sharply and even altered from carbon sink to carbon source. Compared with grassland, forest GPP showed stronger resistance with weaker resilience to droughts. However, larger resilience appeared for both forest and grassland NEE relative to their resistance. All analyses reflect the different adaptive strategies among plant functional types, which is crucial to evaluate ecosystem carbon sequestration to overcome future climate change.
