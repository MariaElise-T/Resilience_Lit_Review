This first ever multidisciplinary, day-long colloquium highlighting the reflections on the resilience and the diversity in the experiences of the first and second-generation Somali-Canadians and beyond was organized in 2017 by Carleton University in Ottawa. This colloquium was designed to create a dialogue between Somali students, academics, and the community and was supported by community partners, the Migration and Diaspora Studies (MDS) Initiative, School of Social Work and School of Indigenous & Canadian Studies at Carleton University. In this paper, I will be presenting notes from this day long colloquium covering topics such as mental health, education, the multiple identities of Somali Canadian youth and the relationship of Somali-Canadians to other communities such as Indigenous nations and other black diasporic communities.
