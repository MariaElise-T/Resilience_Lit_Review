Vietnam is a country that experiences extreme climate conditions and annual accumulated damage due to typhoons and floods, which seriously destroy houses and cause many deaths. Approximately half a million people currently living within 200 m from the coastline live in unsafe houses. Therefore, the Coastal Resilience Project (the project) was implemented to build 4000 storm- and flood-resistant houses for five coastal provinces in Central Vietnam. The paper is carried out to review existing policies and practices related to the maintenance of resilient houses, as well as to propose feasible maintenance solutions for houses to ensure the sustainability of the project. The result shows that currently, there are no technical instructions or manuals on the maintenance and repair of individual houses in general, or the project houses in particular. Most of the households in the project also have very low and unstable incomes. In addition, as they lack knowledge of how construction works, they know little to nothing about the maintenance of a house. From these findings, the authors recommend several solutions for better maintenance policies and practices on the resilient houses of the project in Vietnam. The project provides several lessons in terms of the maintenance of the resilient houses of future projects in Vietnam and elsewhere, by reviewing existing policies and current practices, as well as proposing feasible measures to ensure the sustainability of the project. The findings in this paper provide valuable information for better maintenance policies and practices of resilient houses for other vulnerable coastal provinces in Vietnam and similar contexts elsewhere.
