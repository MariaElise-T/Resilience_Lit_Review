PURPOSE:
To assess whether a curriculum targeting psychological resilience impacts the burnout, mindfulness and self-compassion of obstetrics and gynecology interns.


BACKGROUND:
Physician burnout impacts more than half of obstetrician/gynecologists nationwide. One strategy to reduce burnout is to improve individual physicians' resiliency through cognitive and behavioral strategies linked to wellness in other populations.


METHODS:
A prospective, longitudinal cohort, mixed-methods evaluation of a 12-hour curriculum taught to a residency class of seven obstetrics and gynecology interns was conducted using paired, de-identified, pre- and post-curriculum assessments of Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and Self-Compassion Scale for Researchers (SCS) scores. Data were analyzed descriptively looking primarily at changes in paired scores. A post-curriculum focus group was conducted to further investigate curriculum acceptance and impact.


RESULTS:
Burnout exhaustion and depersonalization scores increased following the curriculum (median difference 3 and 3, respectively). FFMQ and SCS scores also increased (median difference 20 and 7, respectively). Focus group findings suggested interns valued the curriculum, but described an acute increase in distress as they were taken out of their prior “just powering through” coping strategy.


DISCUSSION:
A wellness curriculum targeting improved resident resilience was associated with an acute worsening of burnout, but with short-term improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion, both of which have been associated with improved well-being and resilience in other populations. Worsened burnout may have been a result of increased awareness of uncomfortable thoughts and feelings. Extensive further research is needed on how to develop and measure physician resilience, including long-term implications of improved mindfulness and self-compassion.
