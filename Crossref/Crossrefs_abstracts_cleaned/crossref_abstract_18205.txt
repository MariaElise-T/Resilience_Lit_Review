COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes to the way that the tourist sector operates. Almost all of the tourist businesses are affected by the impact of the measures which were taken in order to deal with the effects of COVID-19. As a result there is high uncertainty on the internal and external environment that the management of tourist businesses would have to take into consideration. Indeed, the change context (internal and external environment) is unstable and this creates uncertainty. For this reason, this publication aims to develop a research framework which links the change context with the level of resilience of hotels during the COVID-19 crisis as well as the impact that this has on the performance. For this reason the paper recommends the use of Melián-Alzola et al (2020)’s research framework which is going to be enriched with the measure taken for COVID-19, which is its key contribution on the academia and the practitioners.
