Objective Individuals vary in response to sleep loss: some individuals are “vulnerable” and demonstrate cognitive decrements following insufficient sleep, while others are “resistant” and maintain baseline cognitive capability. Physiological markers (e.g., genetic polymorphisms) have been identified that can predict relative vulnerability. However, a quick, cost-effective, and feasible subjective predictor tool has not been developed. The objective of the present study was to determine whether two factors—“subjective sleep need” and “subjective resilience”—predict cognitive performance following sleep deprivation. Methods Twenty-seven healthy, sleep-satiated young adults participated. These individuals were screened for sleep disorders, comorbidities, and erratic sleep schedules. Prior to 40 hours of in-laboratory total sleep deprivation, participants were questioned on their subjective sleep need and completed a validated resilience scale. During and after sleep deprivation, participants completed a 5-minute psychomotor vigilance test every 2 hours. Results Both subjective resilience and subjective sleep need individually failed to predict performance during sleep loss. However, these two measures interacted to predict performance. Individuals with low resilience and low sleep need had poorer cognitive performance during sleep loss. However, in individuals with medium or high resilience, psychomotor vigilance test performance was not predicted by subjective sleep need. Higher resilience may be protective against sleep loss-related neurobehavioral impairments in the context of subjective sleep need. Conclusions Following sleep loss (and recovery sleep), trait resilient individuals may outperform those with lower resiliency on real-world tasks that require continuous attention. Future studies should determine whether the present findings generalize to other, operationally relevant tasks and additional cognitive domains.
