Background
Transitioning from treatment to survivorship engenders several challenges that cancer survivors must learn to manage. These challenges are commonly associated with struggling to manage reentry into postcancer life. Thus, balance is restored after cancer, and postcancer experiences should be considered along with all previous life experiences. This balancing process surrounding cancer causes some cancer survivors’ life to deteriorate, whereas other cancer survivors begin a psychological resilience process.


Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the way that psychological resilience is experienced by cancer survivors.


Methods
The present descriptive qualitative design study was conducted from August 2019 through January 2020. A total of 12 cancer survivors were sampled from the follow-up clinics of a hospital. Data were collected through semistructured, pilot-tested, face-to-face interviews using an interview guide.


Results
Three main themes were clarified based on the descriptive analysis of the data on cancer survivors’ experiences: “fight vs lose,” “balancing uncertainties,” and “learned to fly.” The results demonstrate the importance and influence of psychological resilience in the overall cancer experience.


Conclusion
This study provides insight into the subjective psychological resilience process of cancer survivors. Nurses may use this knowledge in fostering effective strategies enabling cancer survivors to develop psychological resilience.


Implications for Practice
The results offer a promising resource for nurses to assess and address the risk and protective factors of cancer survivors to identify unique needs and to provide individualized care. In this context, nurses can develop novel approaches and interventions for cancer survivors in accordance with Kumpfer’s resilience framework.
