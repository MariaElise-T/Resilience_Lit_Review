This study proposed a modified metric inspired by the well-applied “resilience-triangle” framework to integrate the resilience concept within the traffic speed. Firstly, for setting the evolving normal functionality, this study added the concepts of robustness loss and rapidity to characterize and compare the recovery processes of local roads and assess the corresponding resilience under different traffic operation conditions. Secondly, these different evolving resilience patterns provide a quantitative benchmark for detecting the links between resilience and traffic operating conditions and exploring its impact on total resilience. Finally, this study simulated and compared the dynamic evolution of the total resilience of local roads, which accurately captured the weak and poorly resilient road locations. Our findings indicated that the proposed metric was quite efficient and accurate in assisting stakeholders to prioritize the transport planning and the retrofit projects of some specific local roads, which could improve the resilience of overall transport system significantly.
