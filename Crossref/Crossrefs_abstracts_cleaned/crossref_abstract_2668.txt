Nepal is a small landlocked country with complex topography and fragile geology which coupled with its lower-middle income economy, natural resources dependent population, and weak institutional capacity, all combine to rank it as the 4th most climate-vulnerable country in the world (http://maplecroft.com). A climate risk assessment carried out specifically for the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR) at the sector, district and community levels identified the following critical risks: i) water quantity and quality, ii) food security, iii) ecosystem health, iv) animal and human health, v) vulnerable groups, and vi) economic growth and sustainability. Realizing this potential, the Government of Nepal (GoN) with support from the World Bank (WB) launched the Building Resilience to Climate-related Hazards (BRCH) Project in June 2013 with the aim to minimize overall climate risks in Nepal under the global initiatives of Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). It is designed to demonstrate ways that developing countries can make climate risk and resilience part of their core development planning. The results-based monitoring adopted by the BRCH project is a legendary good practice in Nepal, an effective measure towards addressing climate hazards â€“ the ultimate goal of the project and it could be instrumental for the South Asia as well.
