At present, the world's urban development is facing many security challenges, and how to improve the level of urban resilience through resilient governance is the research trend to cope with urban disaster risks. Based on bibliometric analysis methods, this paper analyzes the knowledge graph of journal papers with the theme of “Urban Resilience Governance” from 2010 to 2023 using the Chinese CSSCI database and the English WOS database as the literature sources. The analysis found that: (1) The number of Chinese and English publications increased steadily and slowly in the early stage, and the number of publications soared after a certain year, and relevant research is still growing. (2) Foreign research results on urban resilience have been very rich, and there are many introductions and imitations in China. (3) Domestic and foreign research initially paid more attention to urban planning and design, and in terms of specific disaster types, the West paid more attention to climate disasters, while China paid more attention to social security incidents. (4) In terms of urban resilience governance, there is a lot of research on government-led collaborative governance in China, while foreign countries focus on the use of various social and individual capitals. Finally, the research, analysis and governance of cities as complex giant systems is a major trend in current research.
