In person reidentification distance metric learning suffers a great challenge from impostor persons. Mostly, distance metrics are learned by maximizing the similarity between positive pair against impostors that lie on different transform modals. In addition, these impostors are obtained from Gallery view for query sample only, while the Gallery sample is totally ignored. In real world, a given pair of query and Gallery experience different changes in pose, viewpoint, and lighting. Thus, impostors only from Gallery view can not optimally maximize their similarity. Therefore, to resolve these issues we have proposed an impostor resilient multimodal metric (IRM3). IRM3 is learned for each modal transform in the image space and uses impostors from both Probe and Gallery views to effectively restrict large number of impostors. Learned IRM3 is then evaluated on three benchmark datasets, VIPeR, CUHK01, and CUHK03, and shows significant improvement in performance compared to many previous approaches.
