 The deformation on the carpet texture is generally caused by foot traffic, furniture loading and soiling. The resistance of the carpet to texture distortion depends on the pile yarn characteristic and morphology. In this study, the resilience and appearance retention of carpet samples produced with drawn textured polyester pile yarns which are widely used in the carpet industry, were investigated. In this context, 6 pile yarns were produced with 3 different filament finenesses (3.13, 2.08 and 1.56 dpf) and 2 different disc types (polyurethane and ceramic). The carpet specimens were applied to compression/recovery, dynamic loading, hexapod appearance retention and soiling tests. According to the results, the carpet sample with 2.08 dpf filament fineness and produced by polyurethane disc type showed less thickness loss and better compression recovery results. Hexapod test results showed that the carpet samples with the finest filament had the lowest appearance retention levels. For soiling performance, it was observed that carpet samples with coarser filaments had slightly less staining and disc type had a no significance effect.
