This study examined the relations among burn stigma, quality of life, resilience, and life satisfaction, hypothesizing that higher stigma and lower burn-related quality of life would lead to lower life satisfaction; however, resilience would moderate this relation. A sample of 89 participants was recruited from an outpatient clinic of a burn center in a critical care hospital. Participants completed a battery of measures assessing these constructs. Results suggested that burn stigma was associated with reduced life satisfaction after accounting for other variables. Multiple regression models found that burn stigma predicted both affect and body image but not interpersonal relationship quality or sexuality. Interpersonal relationship quality, sexuality, affect, and body image all predicted life satisfaction. Both affect and body image partially accounted for the relation between stigma and life satisfaction, and resilience accounted for the relation between stigma and affect. Findings reinforce previous literature that has shown a relationship between stigma and life satisfaction but also emphasizes the role of resilience and burn-related quality of life. Individuals who experience a burn injury may have innate resilience abilities, which allow them to bounce back from stressors; thus, resilience can be a targeted strength to bootstrap in order to improve adjustment outcomes.
