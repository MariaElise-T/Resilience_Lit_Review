Intensive human and economic activities in urban areas have had adverse effects on local resources and ecology, leading to a decline in ecological resilience. Enhancing ecological resilience is crucial for improving the urban ecosystem's ability to withstand and recover from external risks. However, quantitative research on urban ecological resilience remains somewhat ambiguous, with many studies lacking comprehensive assessment methods from multiple perspectives. In this study, we established a comprehensive framework to assess urban ecological resilience based on four regime attributes. The study's results indicated the following key findings: The average urban ecological resilience value exhibited a trend of initially declining and then recovering. Cities proposed different approaches when considering and managing social and ecological relationships during the development process. A significant correlation between urbanization levels and ecological resilience was observed, with urban ecological resilience increasing in areas with low urbanization levels and sharply decreasing in areas with high urbanization levels. The findings from this study provide a specific theoretical foundation for decision-makers involved in urban planning and development strategies.
