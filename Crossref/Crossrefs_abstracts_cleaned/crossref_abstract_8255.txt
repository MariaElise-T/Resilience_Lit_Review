Despite widespread acknowledgement of challenges endured by unpaid caregivers, there is still a paucity of studies attempting to elucidate factors that necessitate resilience in caregiving. This integrative review aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to unpaid caregivers’ resilience. Four databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL] and Scopus) were searched for English-language articles (January 2000–August 2021) that considered facilitators and barriers to caregiving resilience among the carer population. A total of 22 articles were identified. Facilitators included carers receiving adequate social support and personal time, and remaining positive; barriers included lack of social support, adopting a negative outlook, experiencing family conflict and financial instability.
