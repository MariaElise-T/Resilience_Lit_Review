PurposeThis study aims to comprehend the role of leagility and resilience in developing sustainable global supply chains, mitigating short-term disruptions and long-term economic impacts from various disasters, in the context of Australian civil infrastructure projects.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs systematic review approach to establish that addressing project success dimensions (i.e. leagility, resilience and sustainability) requires an integrated and extended supply chain approach, encompassing traditional supply chain strategic model elements (i.e. cost/capital, quality and service goals) and supply chain eco-system (i.e. organisations, societies, economies and nature).FindingsThe study underscores the need to enhance supply chain leagility and resilience to achieve sustainability. This can be achieved by developing skills needed to plan across project phases and time frames, aligning with short and long-term organisational goals, assuming smart risks in the face of uncertainty.Research limitations/implicationsThis study extends the traditional supply chain strategic model by introducing new priorities to minimise the consequences of disruptions and to effectively respond to them. The integration of leanness, agility and resilience ensures a sustainable supply chain even in the times of uncertainty, disruption and volatility.Originality/valueThis research provides an opportunity for practitioners and policymakers to rethink and redesign the conventional supply chain model of cost, capital, quality and service objectives. It introduces pioneering concepts by acknowledging and incorporating emerging priorities, especially in Australian civil infrastructure projects. The study integrates leagility and resilience into the existing strategic framework, adding crucial dimensions for sustainable supply chains in infrastructure companies.
