In order to explore the dimensions of college students’ resilience and compile a measuring tool for contemporary Chinese college students’ resilience, semistructured interviews are conducted with 20 college students who have experienced adversity, and the initial dimension of college students’ resilience is obtained. Based on the initial dimensions, the project is compiled to form the “College Students’ Resilience Scale,” which is tested for 1374 college students, and four dimensions of the scale are obtained through exploratory factor analysis. The college students’ resilience scale consists of 26 items with 4 dimensions, namely, “self-efficacy and adaptability,” “positive cognition,” “negative emotion adjustment ability,” and “perceived use of social support.” The self-made college students’ resilience scale has good reliability and validity and is an effective measuring tool for college students’ resilience.
