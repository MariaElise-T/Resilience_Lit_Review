This research aims to analyze the relationship between sports age and psychological resilience level in gender, biological age, sports age, branch, and gender of student-athletes and competitive university students. "Personal Information Form" was used to determine the various demographic characteristics of the participants, and the "Short Resilience Scale" was used to determine the levels of resilience. According to the study's findings, there is a significant difference between psychological resilience and the sports age of male athletes in terms of sports age and gender. There is no significant difference between psychological resilience and sports age of female athletes in terms of biological age, branch, and gender. According to the research results, sports age is more effective than biological age on psychological resilience. As the duration of doing sports increases in males, psychological resilience develops, but the same is not valid for females. In addition, male students are more psychologically resilient than female students, and those who do individual sports are psychologically more resilient than those who do team sports. According to the results of the research, it can be concluded that psychological endurance level may differ depending on various circumstances.
