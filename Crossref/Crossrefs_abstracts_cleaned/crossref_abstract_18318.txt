Data was collected using a demographic characteristics questionnaire and Connor Davidson questionnaire of resilience which were completed before and after the intervention. Results: Independent t-test did not show a significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (P > 0.05). However, the mean score of the resilience was significantly different after intervention (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The intervention of stress management skills training can be effective for family caregivers of heart failure patients in a sample of Iranian society.
