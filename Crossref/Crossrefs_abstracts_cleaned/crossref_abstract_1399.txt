The resilience of urban development refers to how cities and their hinterlands may or may not recover after environmental, social and economic crises. Within this realm, the study contemplates on the resilience of various real estate situations. The focus is on the socioeconomic consequences and opportunities arising in an existential crisis. The issues at stake concern density or dispersion of property developments together with the extent of dominance afforded by the private sector and average citizen. The conceptualization is illustrated by an examination of the Covid-19 outbreak in spring 2020 and its aftermath. This study builds on an earlier predictive study by the same author, now with the benefit of hindsight.
