PurposeThe present study aims at developing a model to quantify supply chain resilience as a single numerical value. The numerical value is called resilience index that measures the resilience capability of the case company's supply chain. The model calculates the index value based on the interactions between the enablers of supply chain resilience and its dimensions.Design/methodology/approachGraph theoretic approach (GTA) is used to evaluate the resilience index for the case company's supply chain. In GTA, the dimensions of resilience enablers and their interdependencies are modelled through a digraph. The digraph depicting the influence of each dimension is converted into an adjacency matrix. The permanent function value of the adjacency matrix is called the resilience index (RI).FindingsThe proposed approach has been illustrated in context of an Indian automobile organization, and value of the RI is evaluated. The best case and the worst-case values are also obtained with the help of GTA. It is noted from the model that strategic level dimension of enablers is most important in contributing towards supply chain resilience. They are followed by tactical and operational level enablers. The GTA framework proposed will help supply chain practitioners to evaluate and benchmark the supply chain resilience of their respective organizations with the best in the industry.Originality/valueA firm can compare the RI of its own supply chain with other's supply chain or with the best in the industry for benchmarking purpose. Benchmarking of resilience will help organizations in developing strategies to compete in dynamic market scenario.
