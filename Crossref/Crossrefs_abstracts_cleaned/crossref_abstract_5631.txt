Hardiness and resilience are known as internal traits that buffer the negative effects of stress and play important roles in individuals’ well-being and psychological sustainability. This study aimed to validate the Korean version of the hardiness resilience gauge (HRG Korean). Reliability and validity were analyzed using data obtained from 389 Korean adults. Confirmatory factor analysis with three factors (challenge, control, and commitment) for the HRG Korean showed acceptable model fit, with satisfactory RMSEA and SRMR indices, allowing for some covariance in error terms. Cronbach’s α for challenge, control, commitment subscales, and the total HRG Korean were 0.84, 0.74, 0.86, and 0.92, respectively. Analyses of the concurrent validity revealed that the total score of the HRG Korean was closely correlated with the scores of the KHD-SF and MR-KA, which measure hardiness and resilience in Korea, respectively. In addition, the HRG Korean was relatively strongly correlated with life satisfaction and subjective happiness. These findings suggest that the HRG is a valid instrument for measuring Koreans’ hardiness and resilience to promote their well-being and sustainability.
