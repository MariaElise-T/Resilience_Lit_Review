 This paper is concerned with the problem of non-fragile (resilient) H∞ control for a class of state-delay nonlinear discrete-time systems described by (TS) fuzzy models where both the state feedback and static output feedback are investigated. Based on basis-dependent Lyapunov-krasovskii function, sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the system stability and the H∞ performance. The linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is proposed to obtain the state-feedback gains, and a homotopy-based iterative LMI algorithm is developed to get the static output feedback gains. An illustrative example shows the effectiveness and the feasibility of the theoretical developments.
