 The objectives of this exploratory study were to investigate (a) the effects of poverty, and (b) family resilience strategies used in managing poverty among the Bakweri of Bonavada villages in Cameroon. Fifty heads of families comprising 250 persons constituted the participants of the study. Ten of the family heads who are opinion leaders were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide and ten participated in a focus group discussion. In addition, an unstructured interview was used to collect data from 40 heads of families. Data were analysed using content analysis and descriptively using percentages. The study found that the effects of family poverty are multifaceted, and families depend largely on resilience and their socio-cultural context to cope with poverty.
