We read the focal article by Britt, Shen, Sinclair, Grossman, and Klieger (2016) with special interest. About 10 years ago, we were asked to write a chapter on hardiness (Beehr & Bowling, 2005), and in doing so we had many observations about hardiness that were similar to Britt et al.’s observations about resilience. Our chapter was most closely aligned with the “capacity” concept of resilience, but we think that both the “capacity” approach and the “demonstration” approach to resilience have merit.
