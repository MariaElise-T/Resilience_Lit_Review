The purpose of this study was to explore sojourning Japanese mothers’ perceived family resilience. The study used Walsh's Framework of Family Resilience in relation to children's behavioral adjustment, perceived stress, and marital satisfaction. Using a quantitative approach, the findings based on responses from 70 mothers revealed the importance of having a strong “belief system” as an adaptive strategy in response to family relocation. The results also indicated that perceived stress, marital satisfaction, and family resilience were significant factors of children's adjustment to the relocation. Implications and recommendations for educators and employers were discussed.
