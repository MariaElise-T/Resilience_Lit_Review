AbstractThere is scant research on how Asian American adolescents’ resiliency relates to mental well-being in adulthood. The objective of this study was to determine the prospective associations between resiliency factors (individual, family, and school community) in adolescence and mental health outcomes in adulthood, among a national sample of Asian Americans. We analyzed data from 1020 Asian American adolescents who were followed for 14 years in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Of the resiliency factors, individual self-esteem (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 0.54, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.37–0.79) and family connectedness (AOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.93) in adolescence were found to be protective against adult mental health outcomes in logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic factors and baseline mental health. Our study identified individual and family resiliency factors which can be leveraged to help Asian American adolescents and families in cultivating better mental health.
