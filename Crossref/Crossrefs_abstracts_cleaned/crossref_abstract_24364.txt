Significance
Adverse life conditions are linked to increased expression of proinflammatory genes and reduced expression of antiviral genes. However, these findings have come from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. Therefore, we evaluated adversity-related gene regulation among former child soldiers in Nepalâ€”a non-WEIRD population. We found that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience were inversely and independently associated with gene regulation among a population exposed to war during childhood. The results suggest that gene regulation responses to adversity are not restricted to WEIRD contexts and they underscore the role of psychological resilience in determining the molecular impact of traumatic experiences. Promoting resilience, even in the absence of PTSD symptom reduction, may have benefits for physical and mental health.
