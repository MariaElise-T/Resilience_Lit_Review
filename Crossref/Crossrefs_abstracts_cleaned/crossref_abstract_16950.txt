Over the past decades, numerous studies have repeatedly demonstrated the risk factors and long-term negative outcomes associated with adverse childhood experiences. However, the factors that contribute to positive development and psychological resilience after adverse childhood experiences are less well known. The aim of this study was to understand the childhood resilience factors of young adults who experienced adverse childhood experiences. Focus Group Interview was used in this qualitative study. Participants were young adults (n= 6) who were university students between the ages of 21 and 26 (mean age = 23.17, SD= 2.14). The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results showed that individual, relational and societal factors played a protective role in the participants' childhood. At the same time, participants emphasized that relational and societal protective factors had some shortcomings or potentially damaging consequences. This preliminary study uncovered multiple layers of childhood protective factors (individual, relational and societal) and emphasized the importance of assessing the multifaceted nature of protective factors.
