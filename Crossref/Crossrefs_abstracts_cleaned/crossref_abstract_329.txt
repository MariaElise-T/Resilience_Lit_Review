PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the significance of psychological resiliency for evacuated disaster survivors and the possible implementation of a concept known as homes away from home aimed at fostering such resiliency.Design/methodology/approachTo address the topic of resiliency in evacuated disaster survivors, first an evacuation scenario is explored. The scenario is followed by a discussion of disaster psychology, resiliency, and a development of the homes away from home concept.FindingsThe development of an evacuated disaster survivor's individual and community resiliency shows promise as an effective means of mitigating the psychological damage of a disaster or terrorist attack. The implementation of the homes away from home concept, designed to foster such resiliency in emergency shelters could be effective.Practical implicationsIncorporating accommodations for the development of individual and community psychological resiliency in emergency shelters in emergency operations plans could be more tangible with the homes concept. A shift in sheltering practices is necessary to meet not only the basic needs of survivors but higher needs as well.Originality/valueThe homes away from home concept is new as there are few if any models for emergency shelters that specifically offer direction to local jurisdictions to develop individual and community resiliency.
