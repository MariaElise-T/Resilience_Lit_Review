The authors designed this study to understand how adolescents overcome suicidality from the subjective perspective of 13 previously suicidal female participants. A resilience framework was used to conceptualize the process. Data analysis using basic interpretive qualitative inquiry revealed 4 domains of resilience: social processes, emotional processes, cognitive processes, and purposeful action. The domains were inextricably linked; improvements in 1 domain produced changes across others, adding momentum to the resilience process. Implications for practice are discussed.
