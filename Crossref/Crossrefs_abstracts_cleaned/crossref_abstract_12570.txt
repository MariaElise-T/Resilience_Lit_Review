 This study’s objective is to examine the relationship between emotional demands and emotional social support at work, and the impact of resilience on health. A cross-sectional study of 156 firefighters was conducted. Descriptive analyses of the study’s variables were performed, along with structural equation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis. The results suggest statistically significant relationships among the study’s variables. Social support from one’s boss and intense emotional demands were found to have an interaction effect on firefighters’ resilience. The findings confirm the mediating role of resilience and the relationship with emotional social support from the boss on firefighters’ occupational health.
