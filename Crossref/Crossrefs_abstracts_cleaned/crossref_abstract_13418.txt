This study examined the influence of demographic and job-related factors on resilience and hope scores among medical professionals. Regression analyses and ANOVA tests were employed, focusing on age, gender, job occupation, and specific job roles such as Doctor, Nurse, and Medical Technician, No significant difference was found in resilience scores across job roles. Age and gender did not notably impact hope scores. Furthermore, specific job occupations and age demographics (Young Adult vs. Middle Aged Adult) showed no significant influence on resilience and hope scores, respectively. The regression models exhibited minimal predictive power. The examined variables might not be strong predictors for either resilience or hope scores among medical professionals. These findings underscore the importance of holistic well-being and mental health support for all medical professionals, irrespective of demographic or job-related factors. Future research is recommended to incorporate a broader set of predictors, focusing on personal experiences, training paradigms, and support systems.
