Background:The professional quality of life of healthcare professionals in emergency departments may be compromised during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Objectives:This study aims to examine professional quality of life and resilience as well as their relationships among emergency department healthcare professionals in Hong Kong during the COVID‐19 outbreak.Methods:This study employed a cross‐sectional design. Healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) working in emergency departments in Hong Kong were recruited via snowball sampling. The Professional Quality of Life Scale, version 5, and the 10‐item Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess their positive (compassion satisfaction) and negative (secondary traumatic stress and burnout) aspects of professional quality of life and self‐reported resilience. Socio‐demographics and work‐related characteristics were also analysed.Results:A total of 106 participants provided valid responses. The results showed an overall moderate level of compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress and burnout among emergency department healthcare professionals. The mean score of the 10‐item Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale was 23.8. Backward linear regression analyses revealed self‐reported resilience was the only significant predictor of compassion satisfaction (regression coefficient B = 0.875; p < 0.001), secondary traumatic stress (B = −0.294, p < 0.001) and burnout (B = −0.670; p < 0.001), explaining 70.6%, 18.5% and 59.8% of total variance, respectively.Conclusion:Emergency department healthcare professionals in Hong Kong experienced an overall moderate level of professional quality of life during the COVID‐19 outbreak. Those with a higher level of self‐reported resilience had better compassion satisfaction and lower levels of secondary traumatic stress and burnout. The results support the importance of developing interventions that foster resilience among this group of emergency department healthcare professionals to combat COVID‐19.
