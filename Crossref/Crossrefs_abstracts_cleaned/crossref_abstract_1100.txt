The “Economics of Climate-Resilient Development” present a comprehensive mitigation plan to avoid future socio-economic crisis. The authors foresight that unless strategies are adapt effectively and efficiently today by the different communities and specially in the developing low income countries, the world would be vulnerable to economic shocks that never been experienced before.The book can be considered unique since it linked the economic development with the techniques of adaptation. It coincides with work the reviewer published about resilience economy where approaches for enhancing people and communities are explained in order to reach the minimum expected adaptability and flexibility. Buheji (2018a, 2018b).However, the work of Fankhauser and McDermott (2016) greatly focus on climate change, as the main challenge of economic development. The work would be greater if the editors ensure more inclusion and details on the nature of human being journeys.The issue of poverty covered in the book is a good example of foresighted socio-economic risk that needs to be mitigated to avoid deterioration due to many conditions that mostly would be uncontrollable due external unforeseen factors. In an earlier work, these factors were seen the cause for more complexity of the business models, which required proactive resilient practices, Buheji (2017).
