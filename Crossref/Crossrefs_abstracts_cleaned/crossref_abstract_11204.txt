 The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of games, where characters must overcome adversity, on playerâ€™s perceptions of their psychological resilience. Located on the PlayStation blog (blog.us.playstation.com ), the online PlayStation Network (PSN) community group focuses on video gamers unique stories and experiences. Using a qualitative and exploratory design, blogs posted between March 2012 and January 2013 were analyzed for content describing experiences via gameplay that members reported made them feel more resilient. Both social and emotional aspects of resilience were discussed with players reporting game experiences had helped them feel more confident in their abilities. Many also associated themselves with the same resilient traits as their characters display in games. A range of popular off-the-shelf video games were reported as helpful in providing players with the opportunity to feel confident under pressure and, importantly, some players reported transferring these positive psychological effects to their real-world lives.
