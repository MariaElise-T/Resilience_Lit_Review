Based on the unique physical, psychological, and social nature of HIV infection, clients with HIV infection have been categorized as both vulnerable and resilient in the existing literature. Concept exploration of vulnerability and resilience via an integrative literature review was conducted in order to examine the existing knowledge base of these concepts in the context of HIV infection. Search engines were employed to review the existing data-based sources of vulnerability and resilience with relation to HIV infection. After the integrative literature review, an analysis of vulnerability and resilience in the context of HIV infection emerged. Implications for further concept analysis, theory, research, and practice are presented.
