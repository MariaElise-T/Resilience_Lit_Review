The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between teachers' self-compassion, forgiveness, and resilience. For this purpose, a total of 410 volunteer teachers, 222 women and 188 men, working in schools affiliated to the Ministry of National Education were reached. In the study, in which the relational screening model was used, the "Personal Information Form," the "Self-Compassion Scale," the "Heartland Forgiveness Scale," and the "Psychological Resilience Scale" were applied to the teachers. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient analysis, independent samples t-test, one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kruskal-Wallis H-test were used to analyze the data. According to the data obtained from the study, there is a statistically significant relationship between teachers' self-compassion, forgiveness, and resilience. In addition, it was found that the scores for self-compassion and forgiveness differed significantly depending on the variables of gender and birth order, forgiveness depending on the variable of marital status, self-compassion and psychological resilience depending on the variable of seniority, and psychological resilience depending on the variable of industry. The results of the study were discussed, and suggestions for future studies were presented.
