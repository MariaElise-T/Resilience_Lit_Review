Resilience is a concept used frequently among researchers and educational and health authorities in discussions of attempts aimed at reducing social, emotional and educational problems among our children and young people. The central role of schools in the lives of children has logically meant the involvement of schools in any programs aimed at building resilience in children and adolescents. However, those who would be most intimately involved in implementing such programs are often confused by the concept and what is expected of them to build resilience on a daily basis. This paper seeks to clarify some of this confusion by highlighting some of the main findings about resilience in the existing literature. It then seeks to consider how this knowledge can be considered within each of the areas that will be needed to work as an integrated whole to achieve lasting results, as well as considering some of the issues that may hinder that goal.
