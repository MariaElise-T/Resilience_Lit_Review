Objectives: The study aimed to identify the dilemma of resilience for the donors and the hosts in response for the Syrian refugee crisis in the case of Jordan and the European Union (EU) and how Jordan and the EU attempt to tackle it.
Methods: The study was conducted and built primarily upon textual analysis of secondary data of various texts from official European and Jordanian websites, news reports, and scholarly literature on resilience, as well as document analysis of different EU-Jordan official policies including their bilateral and multilateral agreements to trace the goals for Jordan and the EU within these policies ,the shift towards resilience as a priority for the EU, the new mechanisms and tools the EU uses to build resilience in Jordan, and how it might be a better strategy, at the same time, dilemma for them both.
Results: The results of the study showed that resilience may appear as a dilemma; however, the EU and Jordan are working to resolve it through focusing on its bright side. More importantly, its role in preserving Jordan's social cohesion and its stability makes it a better security strategy than providing humanitarian assistance.
Conclusions: The study recommends the need for strategies to enhance resilience in both Jordan and the EU. Jordan can boost exports to the EU by raising awareness about the rules of origin scheme, especially among remote area industries. The EU should find a balance between its humanitarian and political efforts in the region.
