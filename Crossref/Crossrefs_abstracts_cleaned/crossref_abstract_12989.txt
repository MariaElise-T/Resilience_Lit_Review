Microgrids have the potential to provide reliable electricity to key components of a smart city’s critical infrastructure after a disaster, hence boosting the microgrid power system’s resilience. Policymakers and electrical grid operators are increasingly concerned about the appropriate configuration and location of microgrids to sustain post-disaster critical infrastructure operations in smart cities. In this context, this paper presents a novel method for the microgrid allocation problem that considers several technical and economic infrastructure factors such as critical infrastructure components, geospatial positioning of infrastructures, power requirements, and microgrid cost. In particular, the geographic allocation of a microgrid is presented as an optimization problem to optimize a weighted combination of the relative importance of nodes across all key infrastructures and the associated costs. Furthermore, the simulation results of the formulated optimization problem are compared with a modified version of the heuristic method based on the critical node identification of an interdependent infrastructure for positioning microgrids in terms of the resilience of multiple smart critical infrastructures. Numerical results using infrastructure in the city of Pittsburgh in the USA are given as a practical case study to illustrate the methodology and trade-offs. The proposed method provides an effective method for localizing renewable energy resources based on infrastructural requirements.
