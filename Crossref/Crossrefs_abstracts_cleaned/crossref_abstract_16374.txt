Purpose
This paper aims to examine the role of employee engagement (EE) as a mediator in the relationship of extra-role performance (ERP) with leader member exchange (LMX), high-involvement human resource practices (HI HRPs) and employee resilience (ER) in the emerging service sector organizations in India.


Design/methodology/approach
Data have been gathered from 328 employees from executive and non-executive grades from metro rail organizations of North India through structured questionnaire. Before analysis, missing data and outliers were examined. Structure equation modelling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis have been performed to analyse the hypothesized model.


Findings
Findings reveal that all the constructs taken in the study – LMX, HI HRP and ER – had a positive influence on employees’ ERP through EE.


Research limitations/implications
This study is helpful in providing better understanding of the predictors of EE and the way it affects employees’ ERP for researches that are aiming to conduct related research studies in an Indian context. To achieve higher employee performance, organizations need to identify factors or drivers that potentially increase the EE levels, thereby, increasing the employees’ performance. This will also help HR practitioners in shaping and formulating effective organizational policies and practices.


Originality/value
This study has considered the emerging service sector organizations in India that have not been endeavoured before as earlier studies concentrated more on Western countries. The result of the study is congruent with that of the previous studies by establishing a positive relationship between EE and employees’ ERP and also concludes that LMX, HI HRP and ER have positive influence on EE.
