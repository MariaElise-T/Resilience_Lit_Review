 Using bibliometric analysis, quantitative content analysis, qualitative thematic analysis, and spatial analysis, this paper analyzes the intellectual landscape of research on tourism resilience over the past two decades. The results show that tourism resilience research has not yet established a close collaborative network at the international level, although the themes of tourism resilience research have been diversified. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on tourism resilience can be divided into two stages. Climate change and the pandemic are the two major factors affecting tourism resilience at destination, organizational, and individual levels. Additionally, we identified five major themes of tourism resilience research. Finally, we provide three suggestions for rebuilding a new paradigm of tourism development in the post-pandemic era. It is hoped that the study contributes to promoting tourism resilience studies and provokes critical thought about whether tourism development need a “pandemic turn.”
