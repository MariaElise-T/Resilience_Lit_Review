 Cold supply chain (CSC) comprises temperature-sensitive processes, starting from the supply of raw materials, manufacturing, and finally the delivery of finished goods to the end consumers via transport services. Pandemics such as COVID-19 pose threats to its overall functioning and to cater to this issue, the study will ensure the sustainable functioning of CSC by recommending resilience strategies. To do so, the COVID-19 disruptions in the CSC and the resilient sustainability strategies were collected via a vigorous literature review and were analyzed via a Fuzzy QFD technique. The results concluded “crisis simulation,” “identification and securing of logistics,” and “digitalization of cold supply chain” as the top three strategies to ensure the resilience of CSC under disruptions caused by COVID-19. The study recommends necessary steps to the policymakers to ensure a resilient and quality effective CSC. The application of the study proves to be the first of its kind in a developing country such as Pakistan.  JEL Classification: C54, D81, H12
