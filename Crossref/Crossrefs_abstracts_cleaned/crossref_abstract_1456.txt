Resiliency is the ability to survive and thrive despite exposure to negative circumstances. This study compared 4 models of resiliency (compensatory, risk‐protective, protective‐protective, and challenge) in the context of adolescent aggression. Each model proposes a different relationship between risk and protective factors. The risk factor was exposure to violence. Protective factors were closeness to an adult, importance of religion, selfesteem, relationship competence, constructive communication, and constructive anger. Data for testing the models came from a survey of 1,747 8th and 9th graders in a rural county. Results suggest that the most appropriate model of resiliency varies by gender of the adolescent. The protective‐protective and challenge models were supported for females. None of the models were supported for males. Gender differences in socialization and development may explain study findings.
