Abstract
Taking a short view into the nowadays conflicts an also to the ones that are shortly to come we can realize that there are some major elements that influence them like: urbanism, climate changes, globalization, the growth and the migration of the population and of course the current economic crises. It seems like in our present time, there a lot of methods that can help us to reduce as much as possible the risks that appear in the crisis times. It is well known that people behave different when a crisis time arises. In the following document, we are going to focus on human behavior in crisis times, the factors that influence the way people act when they are passing through different situations, how we integrate these behaviors together from which we are going to conclude and propose different types of models that can create a powerful warning system, hoping to increase the efficiency of crisis management. The present article states that there is not a universal direction that can be followed in order to solve crisis because resilience in crisis situations depends not only on the education and the social environment in which a human being grows but also on the actual context of personal development that a person has achieved.
