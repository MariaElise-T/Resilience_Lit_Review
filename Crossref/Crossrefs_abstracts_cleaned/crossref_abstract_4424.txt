An earthquake, as one of the natural disasters, can damage vital infrastructures including the power distribution network (PDN) and water distribution network (WDN). The dependency of WDN on PDN is the other challenge that can be highlighted after the earthquake. In this paper, the resilience improvement planning of integrated PDN and WDN against earthquakes is solved through stochastic programming. Power lines and substation hardening in PDN and water pipes rehabilitation with better material are the candidate strategies to minimize the expected inaccessibility value of loads to power and water as the resilience index and to minimize the cost of strategies. The proposed model is tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus PDN with a designed WDN and its performance is evaluated under different cases where the impacts of using distributed generations (DG) in PDN, equipping the water pumps to back-up generators, and the value of loads accessibility to water on the system resilience are investigated.
