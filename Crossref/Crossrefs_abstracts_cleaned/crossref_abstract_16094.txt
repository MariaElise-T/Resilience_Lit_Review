AbstractSecure energy providing is a critical feature of sustainable societies, where this subject requires reliable operation of generation, transmission and distribution infrastructures. In order to achieve the mentioned goal, the influence of uncertainties should be analyzed using appropriate methods, criteria and tools. The high‐impact low‐probability (HILP) events are special uncertainties that can affect the safe operation and lead to irreparable damages. This paper presents a comprehensive review of resilience in electrical energy systems consisting of fundamental concepts and definitions, challenges, enhancements and future proceedings. In this regard, a resilience evaluation framework is designed first in which all the necessary actions for a resilience study are defined. In the next step, various HILP events are introduced and then the resilience concept is defined accurately and related curves are investigated. Afterwards, the resilience assessment indices and quantitative measures are described and their details and applications are precisely explained. As well, the resilience enhancement strategies are discussed from short‐term and long‐term perspectives and eventually, resilience‐based objective functions and optimization approaches are classified in the last part. It is noteworthy that the main research gaps are also clarified according to the reviewed papers and further suggestions are expressed to cope with the declared problems.
