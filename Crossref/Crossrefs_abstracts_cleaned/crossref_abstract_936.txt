AbstractThe 7.8 MW (moment magnitude scale) earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25, 2015 caused significant casualties and serious damage to infrastructure.The Israeli Emergency Medical Team (IEMT; later verified as EMT-3) was deployed 80 hours after the earthquake. A Forward Disaster Scout Team (FDST) that was dispatched to the disaster area a few hours after the disaster relayed pre-deployment information.The EMT staff was comprised of 42 physicians. A total of 1,668 patients were treated. The number of non-trauma cases increased as the days went by. The hospitalization rate was 31%. Wound debridement procedures were the most common operations performed.YitzhakA, MerinO, HalevyJ, TarifB. Emergency with resiliency equals efficiency- challenges of an EMT-3 in Nepal.
