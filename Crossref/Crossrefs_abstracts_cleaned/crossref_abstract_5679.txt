As the frequency of extreme weather events rises, the resilience of power systems is becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a proactive microgrid management strategy for enhancing the resilience of microgrids (MGs) based on nested Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems with chance constraints. In the proposed method, MGs operate in a special operating mode referred to as the “preparation mode” to protect the vital load and maximize resource operation efficiency when an external grid outage warning is issued. The preparation mode problem is formulated to reflect both the normal and emergency mode operation conditions. The on-event phase-operation problem under emergency-mode operation conditions is nested within the pre-scheduling problem under normal-mode operation conditions in the preparation mode. Further, according to their importance, loads are divided into critical and non-critical ones in the problems. The former is represented by a chance constraint, and the latter is represented by the expected cost of load shedding in the cost function. The numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed preparation mode enables the MG to guarantee a high chance that the critical load will survive and to lower the cost of the non-critical load shedding with a minor increase in resource operation costs.
