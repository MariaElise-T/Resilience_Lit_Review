A randomised, waitlist controlled, trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of the Adult Resilience Program (ARP), a universal prevention social–emotional programme for adolescents and adults, on self‐reported depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, and self‐esteem. Seventy‐six students from a private university in Singapore were randomised to the ARP group or wait‐list control (WLC) group and assessments were conducted at pre‐intervention (T1), post‐intervention (T2), and 6‐month follow‐up (T3). A 2 × 3 mixed between‐within groups multivariate analysis of variance with the between‐group factor of Group (ARP, WLC) and the within‐group factor of time (T1, T2, and T3) and the dependent variables of depression, anxiety, stress, resilience and self‐esteem, with age and stage of degree as covariates showed a significant decrease over time in depression (ηp2 = .20), and anxiety (ηp2 = .06). There was a significant decrease in stress for the ARP only from T1 to T2 (ηp2 = .16). While there was a significant interaction of Time and Group for resilience (ηp2 = .07), there was no significant change in resilience for the ARP group alone. The results provide preliminary support that the ARP can impart essential skills that can have a positive impact on mental health in university students.
