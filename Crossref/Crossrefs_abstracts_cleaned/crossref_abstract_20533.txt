Abstract
Urban resilience is the ability of a city to return or maintain its full functioning in the face of some unexpected or usual disruption. Several cities around the world have sought to achieve urban resilience considering a scenario of several challenges related to climate change and the growing population demand. The built environment needs to adapt and innovate its way of building in order to absorb the concepts of resilience and to produce changes in the current production model of construction. In addition, it is important to evaluate the urban context of each city, since urban resilience strategies adopted in a given place do not necessarily meet the needs of other places. Therefore, this work aims to analyse urban resilience actions applied and applicable to the built environment of the city of Salvador - Bahia - Brazil, in view of studies and practices identified in the world. To this end, a systematic literature review, a documental analysis, and semi-structured interviews with agents of academia, industry, and local government were carried out. As a result, actions at the local and global levels were identified and categorized. Then, these actions were analysed based on the perception and experience of the interviewees. Finally, a current overview of particularities, difficulties, and opportunities for improvement on the urban resilience actions applied and applicable to the built environment of the city of Salvador was obtained, to better direct the actions of the regional construction industry.
