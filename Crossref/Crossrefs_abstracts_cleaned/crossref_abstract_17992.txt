ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to determine whether resilience is associated with depressive symptoms in geriatric populations.MethodA systematic review and meta‐analysis were performed (up to March 2015) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis recommendations on three databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science) with no language restrictions, using a Boolean expression. For inclusion in the study, articles had to assess the older population (60 years or older), assess both depressive and resilience symptoms, and investigate the association between these two variables. Articles not employing validated resilience and depression scales or assessing populations younger than 60 years were excluded. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.ResultsA total of 1094 articles were retrieved from the three databases, 367 of which were duplicates and therefore excluded, giving 727 articles for analysis. Of these articles, seven met the eligibility criteria. All of the included articles were observational and cross‐sectional, found an inverse relationship between depression and resilience, and were conducted in three countries: the USA, China, and Belgium. A moderate inverse correlation was found on the meta‐analysis (r = −0.35, 95% confidence interval: −0.41 to −0.28).ConclusionFew studies were found on this subject in the older population. An association between greater resilience and less depressive symptomatology was identified, albeit based on cross‐sectional studies. These results highlight the need for further studies in the area and the importance of fostering the use of interventions to promote resilience in older adults as a means of preventing and managing depressive symptoms in this population.
