Abstract

Purpose
The aim of the study was to develop a comprehensive questionnaire for assessing resilience in patients with stroke during rehabilitation and examine the questionnaire’s reliability and validity.


Design
A four-phased design was used to develop and validate the questionnaire.


Methods
The preliminary items of the Resilience Questionnaire for Stroke Rehabilitation (RQSR) were generated through a literature review and a qualitative study. Twenty experts were consulted for content validation and modification of the questionnaire. A pilot study was conducted with 55 patients with stroke. A total of 510 participants from seven rehabilitation centers or hospitals were subsequently recruited to examine the psychometric properties of the RQSR.


Results
The RQSR consists of 35 items within three dimensions. Dimensions include effective rehabilitation training, accessible support system, and appropriate self-regulation. The content validity index of the total questionnaire was .9335. Seven factors were derived through factor analysis, and cumulative contribution rate of variance was 65.455%. Cronbach’s alpha of the total questionnaire was .957, with each dimension ranging from .731 to .918, demonstrating high levels of reliability.


Conclusion
The RQSR has sound reliability and validity and can be used as an appropriate tool for assessing resilience for patients with stroke during rehabilitation to facilitate effective interventions.
