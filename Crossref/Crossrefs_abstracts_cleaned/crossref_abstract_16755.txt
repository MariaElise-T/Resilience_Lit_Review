The COVID-19 pandemic reshapes our knowledge and reconceptualises our belief in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as more flexible and resilient than bigger organisations under difficult socioeconomic conditions. The critical issue raised during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that SMEs have confronted great challenges, which are not just concerned about SME survival, but also the paucity of strategic approach for firm revival and resilience. In dealing with the challenges, and based on a set of investigations, firstly, the authors provide a critically insightful review of the UK government Covid-19 responses based on four themes of UK government interventions. Secondly, they offer contextual evidence based on their analysis of SME performance in relation to the government responding schemes and how that affects SME operations in the UK. Thirdly, they propose a framework with tentative strategic solutions based on both theoretical reviews and the empirical analysis for how SMEs revive and become resilient.
