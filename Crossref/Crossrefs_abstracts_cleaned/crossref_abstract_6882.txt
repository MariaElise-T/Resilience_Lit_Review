The focus of this article is on the interface between research on resilience—a construct

representing positive adaptation despite adversity —and the applications of this work to the

development of interventions and social policies. Salient defining features of research on resilience

are delineated, as are various advantages, limitations, and precautions linked with the application

of the resilience framework to developing interventions. For future applied efforts within this

tradition, a series of guiding principles are presented along with exemplars of existing programs

based on the resilience paradigm. The article concludes with discussions of directions for future

work in this area, with emphases on an enhanced interface between science and practice, and a

broadened scope of resilience-based interventions in terms of the types of populations, and the

types of adjustment domains, that are encompassed.
