AbstractIndividuals with a psychotic disorder are at an increased risk of becoming the victim of a crime. A body-oriented resilience therapy (BEATVIC) aimed at preventing victimization by addressing putatively underlying factors was developed. One of these factors is social cognition, particularly facial affect processing. The current study investigated neural effects of BEATVIC on facial affect processing using two face processing tasks. Participants were randomized to either BEATVIC or a ‘Befriending’ control group. Twenty-seven patients completed an Emotional Faces task and the Wall of Faces task during fMRI, pre- and post-intervention. General linear model analyses yielded no differences between groups over time. Independent component analyses revealed increased activation of the salience network to angry and fearful faces in BEATVIC compared to Befriending. Increased activation of the salience network may suggest an increased alertness for potentially dangerous faces.
