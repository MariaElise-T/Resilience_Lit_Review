Global competition requires many employees to develop innovative work behavior, including those with double roles. The role demands of employees and homemakers put them under heavy pressure, requiring work-family balance and coherence to improve their innovative work behavior. This study aims to test the effects of work-family balance and resilience on innovative work behavior in employed homemakers. The study adopted a quantitative approach by spreading an online questionnaire to 103 already-married corporate employees. The regression analysis results show a significant influence between work-family balance and resilience in innovative work behavior, with a total effective contribution of 62.1%. However, based on the results of the stepwise test, the work-family balance only contributed 4.1%, while occupational resilience contributed to 58% of innovative work behavior.
