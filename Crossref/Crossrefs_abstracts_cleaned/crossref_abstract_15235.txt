AbstractIntroducing nature based solutions (NBS) into urban areas is a challenging task for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, the impact and effectiveness of NBS contingent upon the social acceptability of implemented measures. This study uses a dynamic and adaptive social acceptance framework that shows how data-driven science can inform the integration of NBS into cities while also ensuring that the public embraces these solutions. We apply the framework to four different cases: METU Forest in Ankara, Tisza River Bank in Szeged, Forest Garden in Alcal√° de Henares, and Quarries in Milan. The results indicate that the key factor affecting social acceptance are procedural and distributive fairness, perceived risks, costs and benefits, knowledge, experience, and personal norms. Perceived benefit is the single common driver that directly affects social acceptance across the four case studies. Understanding the risk and benefits of an NBS and developing personal norms related to the environment will contribute to the improvement of resilience.
