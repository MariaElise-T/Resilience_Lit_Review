 This article argues that cooperative and mutual enterprises (CMEs) have a key role to play in transforming to sustainable and resilient societies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It looks at the contributions that CMEs have made in responding to the previous and ongoing crisis in Asia and the Pacific region. This article discusses the role of umbrella organisations and how their initiatives can facilitate a ‘trickle-down’ effect throughout the cooperative movement, highlighting examples of stimulus packages and their policy linkages. This article incorporates a brief overview of large national cooperative enterprises and apexes and their substantial contribution to resilience and sustainability. The author demonstrates the major role that cooperatives and mutuals are playing to foster inclusive and sustainable development at the grassroots level. This article concludes by arguing that CMEs are particularly resilient in adapting to a crisis, due to the specific features of the cooperative model, including the values of democracy and solidarity, as well as the principles of cooperation among cooperatives and concern for the community. Strong partnerships between and within cooperatives and mutuals can be instrumental in enhancing the emerging role of the movement as a pivotal actor in transforming towards sustainable and resilient societies.
