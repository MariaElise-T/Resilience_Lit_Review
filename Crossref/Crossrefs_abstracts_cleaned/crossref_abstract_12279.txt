 Secondary schools are purported to play a signiﬁcant role in the resilience enhancement of adolescents; however, there are no measures of resilience designed specifically for use in secondary schools. To address this shortcoming, a resilience at secondary school (RASS) scale was developed and its psychometric properties explored. Five hundred and sixty-two female secondary school students aged from 12 years to 18 years completed the 20-item RASS, which was adapted from the Resilience at University scale. Confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling revealed a 19-item, seven-factor structure. Convergent validity of all the subscales was tenable. Internal consistency of two subscales was not ideal, indicative of the need for further research. The RASS scale and subscales represent promising empirical measures of resilience at secondary schools in Australia. With further refinement, the RASS offers educators in secondary schools a practical measure founded on the skills and behaviours considered critical for psychological resilience which can be used to inform resilience-building curriculum activities.
