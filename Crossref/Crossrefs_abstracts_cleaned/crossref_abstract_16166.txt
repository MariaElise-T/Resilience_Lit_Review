The maritime supply chain is a complex area of study due to the existing vulnerabilities. Theinterdependency of maritime SC on other entities makes it prone to disruptions. This study investigatesmaritime factors including advanced information and communication technologies, strategic alliance,and their effect on supply chain performance in the pharmaceutical sector. The data is collected from109 respondents via a Likert-scale questionnaire. PLS-SEM is deployed to evaluate the measurementand structural models. The results show that the maritime factors namely, advanced ICT and strategicalliance have a significant positive impact on agility and robustness (supply chain resilience), which inturn affect maritime supply chain performance significantly. The study provides useful insights to thepractitioners enabling them to cope with the uncertainties raising the SC performance level.
