Background Veterans who experience military sexual trauma are at increased risk for experiencing suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide. Yet few studies have attempted to discern factors that relate to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among survivors of military sexual trauma. The present study aimed to identify psychiatric and interpersonal correlates of suicidal ideation (primary aim) and suicide attempt (secondary aim) among survivors of military sexual trauma. Methods This cross-sectional analysis included 115 veterans (56 females; mean age = 53.24) who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study and reported experiencing military sexual trauma. Self-report measures assessed psychological distress, hazardous alcohol use, social support, loneliness, social acknowledgment following one’s worst trauma, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Results Military sexual trauma survivors who reported more severe psychological distress (OR = 2.88), hazardous alcohol use (OR = 1.14), and perceived general disapproval from others (OR = 1.14) were significantly more likely to report experiencing suicidal ideation in the past two weeks. Hazardous alcohol use (OR = 1.19) and perceived general disapproval from others (OR = 1.36) were associated with being more likely to report attempting suicide in adulthood. Conclusions Addressing alcohol misuse, psychological distress, and perceived general disapproval from others in relation to one’s worst traumatic event is recommended when assessing and managing suicide risk among veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma. Findings also contribute to a growing literature highlighting the importance of understanding perceptions of the interpersonal response to trauma. Considering the cross-sectional design, longitudinal research is needed to further elucidate the roles of these constructs in predicting suicidal ideation and suicide attempt following military sexual trauma.
