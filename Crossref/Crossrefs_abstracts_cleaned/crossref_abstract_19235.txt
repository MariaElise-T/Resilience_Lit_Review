This study aims to empirically investigate the effect of blockchain technology (BCT) adoption on supply chain resilience (SCR), with the mediating role of supply chain integration (SCI) and the crucial effect of environmental dynamism (ED) as a moderator. Based on data collected from firms operating in the automotive industry in India, the proposed model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equations Modelling (PLS-SEM) via SmartPLS software. The empirical results showed a positive effect of BCT on SCI, which in turn affects SCR. Importantly, SCI acts as a full mediator in the BCT-SCR relationship, which is moderated by ED, that is, the effect of BCT on SCR via SCI is strong when ED is high. This study offers the groundwork for operationalizing BCT in a supply chain context. It also contributes to SCR research by investigating how SCI mediates the effect of BCT on SCR. In addition, this study found a moderating effect of ED on the relationship between BCT and SCI. These results provide insights to auto manufacturers on ways to enhance SCR and ensure safe supply chain operations.
