Rising workload demands for nurses necessitate the implementation of easily accessible and innovative clinician well-being resources on health care units. This pre/post pilot study sought to measure the impact of a mobile workplace intervention, “Room to Reflect” on staff nurse and nurse manager resilience. A mobile toolbox with a sound machine, Virtual Reality headset, and associated Quick Response code audio/video offerings, and a paper Pocket Guide of mindful restoration practices were provided to 7 health care units for a 3 month period. Pre/post questionnaires assessed perceived resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, and intervention feasibility (ease of use), accessibility (spaces used), and effectiveness (restoration). Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, paired and independent samples t-tests, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. From the pre (n = 97) to post (n = 57) intervention period, there was a significant difference in resilience for Clinician 3 staff nurses. A mean increase in resilience was noted among nurse managers following participation in the intervention, z = −2.03, p < 0.05. The Pocket Guide was the easiest offering to use, while VR offerings were accessed the most through Quick Response code. Space and time were the most common barriers to Room to Reflect use. Staff nurses felt supported by managers to use the program, and managers perceived that the program improved nurse job satisfaction.
