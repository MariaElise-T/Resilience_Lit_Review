Resiliency is a concept of foreign origin that appeared in Western scientific cognition and is now a widely used concept. Depending on the context and professional orientation of its application, it has specific aspects of understanding. Resiliency, as a phenomenon, first gained prominence in the legal field, particularly in politics, and was defined as the ability of individual members of the legal profession or political parties to resist the views of opponents. In other words, a common characteristic of resiliency, regardless of the area of application, is the ability to resist psycho-emotional resistance.
