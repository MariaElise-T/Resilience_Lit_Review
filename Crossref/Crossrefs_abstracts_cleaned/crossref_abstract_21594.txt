Background: Coronary heart disease which imposes a heavy burden on the health care system worldwide. Psychological factors are effective in the occurrence and persistence of this disease. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of emotion regulation method based on Gross model and muscle relaxation technique on resilience and anger in patients with coronary heart disease.
Methods: The research method is quasi-experimental and pre-test-post-test and follow-up with the control group. The statistical population includes all patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) between 30 and 50 years old referred to medical centers and private clinics of cardiologists in Ilam in 2021, of which 60 people were available by random sampling and random distribution to three groups. Were divided. The data collection tool is the use of standard resilience and anger scales.
Results: The results of repeated measures analysis of variance showed the effectiveness of Gross model-based emotional regulation training in patient resilience, so that Benson muscle relaxation exercises compared to Gross model-based emotional regulation training increased patients' resilience and effect. It was better. Also, Benson muscle relaxation exercises were effective in reducing patients' anger. However, the results showed the ineffectiveness of Gross model-based emotion regulation training on anger.
Conclusions: By using Gross model emotion regulation training and Benson muscle relaxation exercises, we can take steps to provide services to patients with or with a history of heart disease and reduce the severity of the disease.
