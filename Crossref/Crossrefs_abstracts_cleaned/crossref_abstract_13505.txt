BackgroundAvoidance coping (e.g. sealing over) is common in people recovering from psychosis, but it is not understood why some individuals ‘seal over’.AimsWe examined the hypothesis that individuals who ‘seal over’ do not have the personal resilience to withstand this major life event.MethodFifty participants were interviewed during an acute episode of psychosis and reassessed at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Measures included psychotic symptoms, recovery style, service engagement, parental and adult attachment and self-evaluative beliefs.ResultsSealing-over recovery styles are associated with negative early childhood experience, insecure adult attachment, negative self-evaluative beliefs and insecure identity. Insecure adult attachment was associated with less engagement with services.ConclusionsSealing over was associated with multiple signs of low personal resilience in adapting to psychosis.
