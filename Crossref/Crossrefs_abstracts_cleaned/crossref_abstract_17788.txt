Mental health and health promotion research and practice have consistently revealed the social and structural inequities that boys and men of color (BMoC) face. Moreover, scholarship highlights the importance of gender, especially the concepts of masculinity and manhood, in understanding inequities that are experienced. Providers and community leaders are finding culturally relevant ways to foster healing and restoration while addressing racial trauma and the adverse community environments tied to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). This article introduces the restorative integral support (RIS) model to promote connectivity through networks and to acknowledge the contextual differences BMoC experience when suffering from trauma and adversities. RIS is a framework used to address adversities and trauma while increasing societal awareness and advancing equity. This community-based, multidimensional approach is offered to enhance individual, agency, community, and policymaking leadership, raising awareness of mental health concerns and trauma while offering a flexible guide to developing safe spaces and support for recovery from ACEs and trauma. This article offers an in-depth appreciation of the real-life contexts within which BMoC overcome histories of adversity and trauma, demonstrating how the RIS model is applied to advance structural transformation while fostering community resilience.
