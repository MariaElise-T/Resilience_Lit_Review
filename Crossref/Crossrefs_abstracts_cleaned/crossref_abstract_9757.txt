Resilience is the vital feature of supply chains that confers the ability to withstand the adverse effects of disruptive events. Most of the previous studies have been conceptual, theoretical, normative, or at best qualitative in approach, concentrating on identifying the elements of resilience. In spite of the proliferation of studies, an empirically validated quantitative study on justifying the measurement dimensions of supply chain resilience is rare, thus the need for further quantitative empirical studies. The context of the present study is the manufacturing supply chain of halal pharmaceuticals in Malaysia. A quantitative cross-sectional design was applied by means of self-administered structured questionnaire survey, using the Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management instrument (SCRAMÂ© 2.0). The survey yielded usable responses from 106 manufacturing companies engaged in the production of halal pharmaceuticals in Malaysia. Descriptive statistics as well as partial least square-based structural equation modelling was used to analyze the survey data. This was facilitated by IBM SPSS statistics software (version 21.0), and Smart PLS 3.2.4 respectively. The results suggest that the psychometric properties of the supply chain resilience dimensions (vulnerabilities and capabilities) in the context of the present study are reliable and valid.
