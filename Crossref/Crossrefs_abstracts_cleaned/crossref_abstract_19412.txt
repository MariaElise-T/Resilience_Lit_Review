Abstract
Previous studies have shown that resilience is associated with lower severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and more posttraumatic growth (PTG) in people who have experienced traumatic events. The present study investigated the ways in which resilience is related to PTSD symptoms and to PTG in Chinese traumatized adolescents by considering the role of perceived social support. A total of 247 Chinese adolescents who had experienced a severe tornado 3 months before this study were recruited for this study. The results showed that our model fitted the data very well (χ
2 = 195.691; df = 96; χ
2/df = 2.038; root mean square error of approximation = 0.065; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.959; comparative fit index = 0.967) and reveal that perceived social support partially mediates the relationship between resilience, PTSD severity, and PTG. The clinical implications and limitations of our research and the recommendations for future research are discussed in this article.
