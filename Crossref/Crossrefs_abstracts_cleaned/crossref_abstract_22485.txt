Because of COVID-19, many social interactions have been continued through electronic means. This has been especially true for the educational experience, where professors and students have strived to move to the virtual classroom. The data sets presented here examined how academic professionals have dealt with the stress of the move, how they have strived to become more prepared and eventually more resilient to this change. Using an online platform, we obtained data at the end of the academic period during November and December 2020. The data analyzed three major areas: teaching anxiety and preparedness, resilience, and overall stress, by applying a modified version of the adapted COVID-Stress Scales.Â  We statistically analyzed our data looking for important correlations, to help better understand the challenges educators have met though the pandemic, and how this can assist policy-makers in managing stress and looking for ways to enhance resilience in academic professionals.
