 As a promising public key cryptographic primitive, hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) introduces key delegation mechanisms into identity-based encryption. However, key leakage and recipient anonymity issues have not been adequately addressed in HIBE. Hence, direct applications of traditional HIBE schemes will violate data security and abuse usersâ€™ privacy in practice. In this paper, we propose an anonymous unbounded hierarchical identity-based encryption scheme, which achieves bounded leakage resilience and the hierarchy depth is not limited. Our security proofs based on the dual system encryption technique show that the proposed scheme is capable of resisting key leakage and it realizes recipient anonymity in the standard model. In addition, leakage resilience analysis indicates that our scheme allows the leakage rate of approximate 1/3 no matter the hierarchy depth of identities. Finally, performance comparisons show the practicability of our scheme. In particular, the secret key of our construction is of a fixed-length.
