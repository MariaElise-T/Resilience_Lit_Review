Seafarers working on ships on international voyages have to work in closed environments away from their families and social life, and are socially isolated. In other words, seafarers work in environments in which all vital workplace activities take place together, and the possibility of socialization is very limited. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to examine the indirect effect of perceived organizational support on subjective well-being through psychological resilience and the moderator role of job stress in this interaction by seafarers on merchant ships operating internationally. Data were obtained from 408 seafarers by questionnaire technique. Mediation, moderator, and moderated mediation analyses were performed using Hayes Process Macro. The results show that psychological resilience has a mediation variable role in the relationship between organizational support perception and subjective well-being, but the mediation role of psychological resilience does not change by the level of job stress. This study is the first of its kind to holistically evaluate the relationship between these variables and with a specific focus on seafarers, it offers valuable suggestions to shipping businesses and researchers interested, thus making a significant contribution to the relevant literature.
