This paper represents a bibliometric analysis of the Scopus database publications on resilience and urban planning. The study recalled 1,923 documents from 1997 to 2021 using keywords related to the research topic and analyzed this using Microsoft Excel 2019, VOSviewer and Harzing's Publish or Perish software. The findings show that the expansion rate of works in resilience and urban planning has steadily increased every year since 1997. This study's most frequently used terms are the main keywords, which are climate change, sustainability, urban resilience and spatial planning. Landscape and Urban Planning is recommended as the main target journal for publication of the results of this research analysis. Research on COVID-19 or pandemic resilience, public space and urban mobility may eventually supersede prior dominant themes. The findings suggest that researchers from less contributed countries should explore this topic more to provide nuance to this field.
