 In recent years, resilience has emerged as a prominent topic in global health systems discourse as a result of the increasing variety and volume of sources of instability inflicting strain on systems. In line with this study’s intent to bring together existing literature on health system resilience as a means to understand the process through which systems achieve resilience, a review of academic literature related to health system resilience was conducted. Emerging from this review is an operational model of resilience that builds on existing health systems frameworks. The model highlights health system resilience as a process through which leaders in all sectors need to be mobilized in order to harness instability as an opportunity for health system strengthening rather than a threat to the system’s sustainability and integrity.
