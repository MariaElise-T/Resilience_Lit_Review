The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented move to emergency remote teaching. The present study examined the Scottish context of teacher resilience (TR) by considering the lived experiences of eight Scottish primary school teachers during ongoing lockdowns, referred to as ‘transitional emergency remote teaching’ (TERT). Data from virtual interviews was analysed following an inductive and experiential approach to Braun and Clarke’s (2013) six phases of reflexive thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: ‘Teacher career adaptability’, ‘Relationships within school’, ‘Learning from home’ and ‘Continuous Professional Development’(CPD). Key findings suggest that teachers who demonstrated resilience adapted to TERT and identified new positive aspects to their teacher identities; senior management had a key role in supporting TR; TERT impacted positively on teacher-student relationships with parents increasingly viewed as partners in learning; and reflection promoted help-seeking behaviours, with practitioners desiring more formal reflective opportunities considering the impact of TERT.
