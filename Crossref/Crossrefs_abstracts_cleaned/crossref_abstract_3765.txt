Abstract:  To find the biological basis of resilience, we exploited data from a longitudinal community‐based study of 1,748 adult children, followed from birth to adulthood. Results showed that those with both abuse and perinatal problems demonstrated synergistically impaired well‐being, a higher rate of school dropout, lower sense of success, and lower income. Among abused adult children (n= 271), we found that those without, relative to those with, perinatal problems had lower risk for adult psychopathology. An examination of the biological base of resilience could be added in a multidimensional/multifactorial model to help researchers identify ways to promote resiliency even before birth.
