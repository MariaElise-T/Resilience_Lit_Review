We tested the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of Our Family Our Future, a resilience-oriented intervention engaging families in prevention of adolescent HIV and depression. South African adolescents, 13â€“15 years of age, with mild depressive symptoms, were randomized to intervention or wait-list using parallel assignment in a single-blind trial. HIV risk behavior and depression were evaluated at baseline, 1, and 3 months. We examined intervention satisfaction, fidelity, trial retention, and preliminary efficacy. One hundred-ninety-six adolescent-parent dyads completed eligibility screening and baseline, and n = 73 dyads were randomized. All families ranked intervention quality as good or excellent. Over 90% were satisfied with content. Facilitators were adherent to intervention protocol. All families were retained in post-intervention assessments. Intervention recipients reported diminished depressive symptoms, inconsistent condom use, and sexual activity, as well as increased HIV testing. Our Family Our Future is highly acceptable and feasible and should be tested in a future efficacy trial.
