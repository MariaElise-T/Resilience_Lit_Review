The emphasis of this literature review is on conceptual issues rather than a review of empirical studies. The paper starts by addressing the question why the concept of resilience is particular and what value is added if such a perspective is adopted. Next, the historical context and evolvement of the research on resilience are briefly reviewed with a short overview of the range of research topics in the area. The third section discusses the definition of resilience and its main elements. Section four addresses the main criticisms of the resilience concept. Section five identifies areas for further research.
