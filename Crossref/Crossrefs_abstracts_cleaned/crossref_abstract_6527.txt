The purpose of this paper is to introduce a case for a standardised comprehensive cyber resilience framework for Critical Space Infrastructure (CSI). Based on structure systematic review and meta-analyses, this paper outlines the needs of a risk-based framework. Space assets are fundamental components of critical national infrastructure (CNI), whose destruction significantly impacts many lives. Moreover, todayâ€™s digitally connected space infrastructure is exposed to sophisticated and catastrophic cyber-attacks. This paper lays out the research gap to present the need for a comprehensive cyber resilience framework for CSI and future research and collaboration to understand the emergence of a new category of failures related to space-asset-reliance disruption risks.
