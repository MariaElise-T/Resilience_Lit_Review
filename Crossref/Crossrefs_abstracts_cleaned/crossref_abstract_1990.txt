AbstractThe concept of resilience is commonly used to represent “an ability to adapt to a changing environment and to survive flexibly despite facing difficulties.” This definition of resilience emphasized its aspects of unpredictable responsiveness to external disturbances as well as self-organized phenomena, which seemed to be close to the definition of complex adaptive systems. This article summarizes the technical challenges to consider the implementation of a concept of resilience into systems from a variety of perspectives. Then, challenges to tackle with the resilience to variabilities in production plans, in work quality, in empirical knowledge, in human-automation systems, and in organizations are presented.
