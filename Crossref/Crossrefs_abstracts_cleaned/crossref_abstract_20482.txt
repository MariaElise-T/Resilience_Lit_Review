            The influx of military Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returning to college following active military service presents an unmanageable trend for many secondary educational institutions in the United States. The current study aimed to determine relationships among rumination, resilience, mindfulness, and perceived PTSD symptoms in college student Veterans. To this end, 133 college student military Veterans registered in a U.S. university responded to an online survey. Results revealed that rumination has a direct effect on perceived PTSD symptoms and mediates the relationship between mindfulness and perceived PTSD symptoms, and that resilience moderates the relationship between mindfulness and perceived PTSD symptoms through rumination as the mediator. These findings imply that designing and developing mindfulness-based interventions for college student Veterans with PTSD requires concerted efforts targeted at improving ruminative thinking and enhancing resilience.
