Relevant articles published in English and Indonesia between 2019 and 2022, being quantitative or qualitative theoretical-methodological studies that analyzed or proposed factors to nurses’ resilience in caring for COVID-19 patients, were included, whereas primary studies that used review as a methodology to review an object of research were excluded.


Results
From the 17 articles that were included in this study, 3 factors were found that contributed to the resilience of nurses in caring for COVID-19 patients, namely personal factors, workplace/organizational factors, and social factors.


Conclusions
