Abstract
Networks are resilient to internal failures or external attacks. The resiliency is often beneficial, but there are scenarios where the collapse of a network would benefit society, such as the dismantlement of terrorist, rebel or organized crime groups. In this article, we develop a method to estimate the effect of knockouts and apply our method to the Islamic State recruitment network. Using our novel application, we demonstrate how coordinated attacks against recruiters might reduce the Islamic Stateâ€™s ability to mobilize new fighters. This analysis has direct implications for research on network resilience and terrorist recruitment.
