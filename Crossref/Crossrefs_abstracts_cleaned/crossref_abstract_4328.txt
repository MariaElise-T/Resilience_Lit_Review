This research examined the imperatives of pedagogical updates for Mathematics education professionals: The digital technology sensibility in a resilient word. What informed this research is the need for considering better ways of impacting mathematical knowledge and skills in students as the usages of Mathematics are geometrically increasing in this world of Technological advancement.   Quasi- experimental research of pretest, posttest control group design was adopted. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted in the selection of samples for the study. 101 Senior Secondary School II (SSSII) students were purposively selected as sample for the study base on access to smart phones/computer. Three null hypotheses were generated. Mathematics Performance Test (MPT) was the instrument used to collect data. The reliability of the instrument was calculated using Pearson Moment Correlation Analysis. ϒ=0.88 was obtained which showed that the instrument was good enough for the study. Pre and post tests were conducted and Data collected were analysed using t-test and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The results obtained showed that the use of WhatsApp (treatment) has positive effects on students’ performance in Mathematics. Hence, it was recommended that WhatsApp as a means of communication in Social Media could be employed in the teaching and learning of Mathematics for better performance.
