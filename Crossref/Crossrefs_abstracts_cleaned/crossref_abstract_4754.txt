The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly influenced a lot of organizations. Business Continuity Planning (BCP) should be developed within each organization; however, it is not effective and perplexes organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic will remain prevalent for a few years, and there is a possible future threat of other infectious diseases. Therefore, it is important to learn from this pandemic and apply this knowledge to future BCP. In this study, issues with COVID-19 BCP are clarified by analyzing an online discussion among willing participants. The following suggestions resulted from the analysis: 1. It is difficult to obtain reliable information when it is necessary. 2. Decisions must be made, not knowing whether governmental measures are appropriate or not. 3. Fear results in bias. 4. Responses may delay if one is too dependent upon the assistance and information from government and/or other sources. Based on these results, BCP during the pandemic is suggested to encourage resilience during the uncertain threat expected in the future.
