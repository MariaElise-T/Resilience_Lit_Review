The human intestinal microbiota represents a complex microbial community that plays an essential role in the maintenance of host health. Over the last decade, metagenomic and metabolomic analyses have revealed the influence of intestinal microbial diversity and composition on a range of biological functions in the host. While overall taxonomic composition of the intestinal microbiome is informative, changes in spatial dynamics within the community also have profound biological significance as microbial functions are influenced by neighbouring community members and the microenvironment. Critical gaps remain in our understanding of microbiota structure, co-dependences, resilience and response to antimicrobial agents. In this review, we discuss alternative strategies to deconstruct the microbiome to yield better designed and more clinically effective therapies.
