This study examined predictors of intervention‐induced resilience in children of divorce whose mothers participated in a preventive parenting program. Contextual, maternal, and child factors were examined as predictors of improved child adjustment using two strategies: (a) within‐group analyses conducted with program participants and (b) between‐group analyses, in which relations in the parenting intervention were compared with those in a control condition. Between‐group analyses showed that children were less likely to maintain program gains in externalizing when maternal demoralization was high or when children's self‐regulatory skills were low. Implications for program modification and methodology for studying predictors of program benefit are discussed.
