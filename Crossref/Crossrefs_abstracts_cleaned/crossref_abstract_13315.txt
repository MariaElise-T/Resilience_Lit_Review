The practice of mindful eating brings awareness to food choices, brings attention to the eating experience, and encourages selecting and preparing food that is both satisfying and nourishing. We examined mindful eating in breast cancer survivors following a 9-week, multidisciplinary virtual teaching kitchen intervention called Survivors Overcoming and Achieving Resiliency (SOAR). SOAR engaged participants through weekly cooking classes that also taught multiple domains of mindfulness. Participants (n = 102) were breast cancer survivors and completed the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ) prior to and after completion of the intervention. Linear regression analyses examined relationships between the aspects of mindful eating and body mass index (BMI). Wilcoxon (paired) rank sum tests evaluated the significance of the change in the MEQ total sum and subscales scores. A total of 102 participants completed both the pre- and post-intervention surveys. The mean change between the pre- and post-SOAR MEQ summary scores was 0.12 (sd = 0.30; Wilcoxon p-value = 0.0003). All MEQ subscale scores significantly increased with the exception of the distraction subscale. The MEQ summary scores increased for participants across both BMI stratifications. The SOAR teaching kitchen represents one of the first interventions that is tailored for breast cancer survivors and combines behavioral strategies from mindful eating training to nutritional knowledge and culinary medicine pedagogy in a virtual teaching kitchen. Further research is needed to examine whether mindful eating practices among cancer survivors result in sustainable healthy eating behaviors and food choices consistent with the cancer risk reduction guidelines.
