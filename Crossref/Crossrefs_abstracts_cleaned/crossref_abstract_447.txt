 The relationships among five factors characterized as placing adolescents at risk for behavioral problems such as dropping out of school or drug and alcohol use, and resiliency and coping were evaluated for a sample of 392 students in Grades 7 to 12. Students self-reported to be at-risk differed in scores on resiliency but not in coping from those with no self-reported risk factors.
