This study’s purpose was to investigate the relationship among soldiers’ perceived stress, group cohesion, military life adjustment, and resilience. Specifically, we aimed to verify the mediating effect of cohesion and the modulating effect of resilience. In addition, we examined the mediated modulating effect of resilience within the comprehensive relationship among variables. The research participants comprised 300 soldiers from two different army troops, and a total of 285 data points were analyzed, excluding unfinished responses. The main results were as follows. First, we identified the mediated effect of cohesion in the relationship between soldiers’ perceived stress and their military life adjustment. Second, resilience showed a moderating effect in the relationship between soldiers’ cohesion and military life adjustment. Third, while on the path of moving from perceived stress to successful military life adjustment through cohesion, resilience modulated the relationship between cohesion and military life adjustment. Lastly, in this paper, we address this study’s implications and limitations.
