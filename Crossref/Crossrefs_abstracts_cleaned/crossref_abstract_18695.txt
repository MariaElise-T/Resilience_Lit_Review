People with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have unique individual constellations of cognitive, behavioural and psychological difficulties that may affect their resilience to adverse events and ability to cope with stressors. Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns have affected the lives of everyone but may have had a disproportionate impact on the normal and protective structures, activities and routines of people with TBI. We discuss that Covid-19 will continue to affect all our lives for the foreseeable future and suggest that this is an opportunity for clinicians to work with people with TBI and their family and carers to identify individual resilience and vulnerabilities to minimise the negative consequences of Covid-related restrictions.
