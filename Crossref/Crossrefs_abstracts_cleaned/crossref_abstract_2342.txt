This paper describes the development of a disaster resistant community at the University of New Orleans (UNO). It includes the process for obtaining leadership support and “buy in,” for identifying specific expertise within the university community, and for enlisting and ensuring broad stakeholder support and participation in the plan.In late 2004, the author’s research team at the University of New Orleans successfully sought and was subsequently awarded a FEMA-sponsored grant to develop a Disaster Resistant University (DRU). This resulted in the formulation of a comprehensive mitigation plan aimed at identifying and reducing risks throughout UNO’s campus.Early in the planning process, the research team decided that, unlike other universities who had been awarded FEMA DRU grants, it would be important to develop local, “in-house” expertise in disaster resiliency to ensure sustainability. Rather than contracting an external agency to develop the mitigation plan, the researchers decided to leverage the disaster expertise already resident in the UNO community. At the same time, the UNO researchers considered it essential to use a methodology in developing the plan that would ensure representation from a broad range of stakeholders. To do this, the research team utilized a unique collaborative methodology in the hazard identification and mitigation process.
