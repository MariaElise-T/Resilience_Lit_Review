The epidemic of the COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide. This phenomenon has changed people's lifestyles as well as business activities. Many businesses are unable to operate normally, which is caused /or affected by supply chain disruption. Therefore, supply chain resilience after the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to maintaining the liquidity of businesses and increasing supply chain efficiency. This research aimed to examine factors influencing supply chain resilience and construct a structural equation model for supply chain resilience after the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand's industries. A research framework was developed according to previous literature in the context of supply chain resilience. Five constructs, namely Technology, Flexibility, Collaboration, Agility, and Supply chain resilience, with seven hypotheses were established. A questionnaire survey was developed from the research framework and previous literature. Then, the validity and reliability test of the questionnaire were performed with the Index of Item Objective Congruence (IOC) technique and Cronbachâ€™s alpha, respectively. The data was obtained from 426 business organizations in both the industrial and service industry in Thailand. The structural equation model (SEM) technique was conducted to examine the relationship between constructs. The results revealed that agility was only a factor that directly influenced supply chain resilience, while technology had an indirect effect on it via agility. However, technology has had direct effects on flexibility, agility, and collaboration.
