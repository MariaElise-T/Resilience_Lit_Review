Abstract
Purpose
This paper describes the approach used to develop the Adolescent Family Life Program (AFLP) Positive Youth Development (PYD) Model within the structure of an existing state government-run program.

Description
The California Department of Public Health, Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health (CDPH/MCAH) Division undertook an innovative approach to develop a program model to help expectant and parenting youth build resilience. CDPH/MCAH started by assessing existing program efforts and theory to develop and test new strategies in the field, structure a program model, and build toward broader expansion and sustainability. CDPH/MCAH engaged local organizations from across the state, their staff and enrolled youth, experts, and evaluators in an iterative program development process to standardize an effective model that could be replicated and evaluated.

Assessment
Key lessons for program developers and administrators are to ensure adequate staffing with diverse expertise related to the topic and content to support the multiple components of program development and implementation, evaluation, and training; identify the guiding theory and framework early and link them with clearly articulated core components to ensure the final model reflects the intended purpose and is structured to support implementation; engage implementation staff on the ground and focus early and often on processes for supporting people through change.

Conclusion
The lessons learned can guide others working with existing programs to develop standardized program models or translate new science and theory into practice.
