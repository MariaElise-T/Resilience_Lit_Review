This study attempted to examine the relationship between affection, rejection, and protection of parental parenting attitudes on infant self-determination through infant resilience. To this end, a survey was conducted on 315 parents of 4-5-year-old infants enrolled in kindergartens and daycare centers at institutions in Gyeonggi-do, and 304 copies of the 315 copies were analyzed, excluding unfaithful data. Source: SPSS 22 was used for data processing. The results of this study are as follows.
First, it was discovered that parental parenting attitudes' affection had a static impact on infant resilience, and parental parenting attitudes' rejection and overprotection had a negative impact.
Second, infant resilience had a positive effect on infant self-determination.
Third, the affection of parental parenting attitudes had a positive effect on infant self-determination, and the rejection and overprotection of parental parenting attitudes had a negative effect on infant self-determination.
Fourth, as a result of examining the mediating effect of infant resilience in the relationship between parental attitude and infant self-determination, infant resilience partially mediated in the relationship between infant self-determination and overprotection of parental attitude. This means that infant resilience acts as a factor that can increase infant self-determination in the effect of parental parenting attitude on infant self-determination.
