Migrant laborers from Indonesia have both beneficial and negative effects. This research aims to uncover the characteristics that impact family resilience among migrant workers from Indonesia. This form of research is qualitative and employs a literature review methodology. PMI family issues include a lifestyle of excessive consumption, family discord, parenting, and kid development. There is a shift in the family structure when a woman or husband becomes an Indonesian migrant worker. In this situation, the husband assumes the conventional tasks of the wife, such as childrearing and education; meanwhile, the woman is unable to fulfill the intangible rights and duties (inner life) of their marriage. This is a difficult situation for immigrant families. Intensifying long-distance contact between PMI and their families is the answer to their family troubles. This is to prevent putting the family at risk. Family functions are optimized to the greatest extent possible. In addition, participation and assistance from numerous stakeholders are required. Family watchdog institutions may give PMI family children financial literacy and parenting aid.
