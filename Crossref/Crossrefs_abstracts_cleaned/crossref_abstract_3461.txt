Abstract
The resilience testing project builds on the work carried out by the ‘Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in health’ in its ‘opinion on the organisation of resilient health and social care following the COVID-19 pandemic’, adopted on 25 November 2020 as well as the December 2020 report by the EU Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment (HSPA) titled ‘Assessing the resilience of health systems in Europe: an overview of the theory, current practice and strategies for improvement’. Resilience testing may contribute to the European Semester, which addresses health system effectiveness, accessibility and resilience. The encompassing resilience assessment framework (‘the testing framework’) will serve to detect critical health system weaknesses against specific shocks as well as long-term structural challenges. This will help to develop recommendations for remedial action. The heath system resilience testing methodology will support the implementation of the Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health which envisages stress tests and simulation exercises to help the development of health system functions and preparation of prevention, preparedness and response plans. It could also support the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in their assessment activities of the prevention, preparedness and response plans. By establishing a resilience testing methodology, Member States will be able to regularly and independently review their preparedness for health crisis and check their healthcare systems’ resilience against specific high-pressure scenarios and long-term structural challenges. This action will generate insight and evidence through resilience tests and will reinforce the ability of Member States and regions to become more resilient to future shocks.
