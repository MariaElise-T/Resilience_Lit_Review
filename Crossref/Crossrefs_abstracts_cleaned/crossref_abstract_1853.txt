Abstract
The sea-level rise SRL as a problem exacerbated by climate change, is the biggest disaster for coastal cities, especially for the low elevation areas, which will have a calamitous influence on, infrastructure systems destruction and the economy as well. The predicated SRL- is changeable every day, therefore exposures studies are essential to prepare the database for achieving the coastal cities’ resiliency, mapping the predicate vulnerability level, indicating all challenges related to the climate changes and sea rise level, and identifying plans for adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure systems. The purpose of the research is to focus on using a “Flood Map “and remote sensing on “Alexandria city – Egypt “which has high economic value. The study is based on making maps overlapping (topographical map, land use, and expected SRL in 2100) to measure and provide precise data for the prone zone and safe zone for city extension, by specifying many scenarios and plans that can achieve future city resilience by creating an end-map user.to address the right direction of city expansion. Finally, the study has shown that a flood map is very helpful and it could be used aligned with a full existence and clarity of all-natural and built environment information.
