AbstractComplementary and integrative health approaches can improve health and well‚Äêbeing, as well as play an important role in disease prevention. The concept of whole person health builds on these concepts by empowering individuals, families, communities, and populations to improve their health in multiple interconnected domains: biological, behavioural, social, and environmental. Research on whole person health involves studies of interconnected biological systems and complex approaches to prevention and treatment. Some of these approaches may involve methods of diagnosis and therapy that differ from those used in conventional Western medicine. Of growing interest is how complementary, integrative, and whole person health approaches contribute to resilience. This brief commentary describes an integrated framework for mapping the connections between various complementary and integrative health therapeutic inputs onto aspects of resilience, including the ability to resist, recover (partially or fully), adapt, and/or grow in response to a following a stressor. The authors present selected examples of research studies supported by the National Institutes of Health that test whether complementary and integrative health approaches can promote some aspect of resilience. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in incorporating the study of resilience in complementary, integrative, and whole person health research.
