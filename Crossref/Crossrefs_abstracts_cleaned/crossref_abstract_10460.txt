While cognitive-behavioral theories emphasize cognitive biases that significantly impact people's negative emotional states, positive psychology studies emphasize positive sources of strength, such as psychological resilience, and their influence on achieving psychological well-being. In light of the centralised perspectives of both approaches towards mental health and relevant literature, there is noticeable emphasis in recent years on the use of integration models such as “positive cognitive behavioural therapy”. It is from this precipice that this study examined the concepts of “cognitive distortions”, “psychological resilience” and “subjective well-being”, all of which have been at the centre of studies carried out on cognitive behavioural and positive psychology. The study was carried out within the framework of a hypothetical model specifically concerning one of the most important stages of adolescence development. Furthermore, it aimed to examine psychological resilience as a mediator in the relationship between cognitive distortions and adolescent well-being, within the influence of sex as a moderated variable. 447 adolescents participated in the study. The data was collected using the “Cognitive Distortions”, “Psychological Resilience”, “Adolescent Subjective Well-Being” scales. In examining the hypothesis model, a phasal approach was used. It was determined that cognitive distortion, adolescents' well-being, and psychological resilience have a structural association. Results revealed that psychological resilience partially mediates the relationship between cognitive bias and adolescent well-being. Sex was not determined to have a moderated effect as a mediator.
