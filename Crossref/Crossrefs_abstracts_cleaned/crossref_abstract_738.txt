OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to evaluate current levels of and factors contributing toward burnout and resiliency among new graduate nurses to identify effective mitigation strategies.


BACKGROUND
New graduate nurses are at a high risk of increased turnover in the 1st year of employment. An evidence-based, graduate-nurse centered approach is essential to improving nurse retention among this cohort.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study involving 43 new graduate nurses was completed in July 2021 (a subset of a larger sample of 390 staff nurses). Nurses were recruited to complete the Brief Resilience Scale, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, and a demographic survey.


RESULTS
New graduate nurses scored within “normal resiliency.” This cohort reported moderate levels of burnout overall. Higher levels were reported within personal- and work-related subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
Strategies to reduce burnout and increase resiliency in new graduate nurses should be focused on improving personal and work-related burnout.
