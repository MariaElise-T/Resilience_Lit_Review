Background:
Nursing students experience similar stress-related health issues as RNs and have been identified as a group of health professionals who may be unable to cope effectively with stress. Studies have emphasized the need to incorporate resilience programs at higher education institutions for nursing students. However, it is important to identify strategies that increase resilience to ensure future programs are effective and follow an evidence-based approach.


Method:
This mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists for assessment and quality appraisal. Data were extracted and synthesized thematically.


Results:
Category intervention strategies were identified and used to cluster three intervention strategy themes. Three outcome themes also were synthesized to examine strategy effectiveness.


Conclusion:

              Findings indicate multicomponent interventions that include information sharing, skill application, and reflective learning are effective in helping nursing students manage stress and increase resilience.
