AbstractObjectiveDepression is highly prevalent among 1st‐year college students, and evening chronotype is an important risk factor associated with depression. This study investigates the mediating role of sleep quality and the moderating role of resilience between chronotype and depressive symptoms.MethodsA total of 4531 students were included in this cross‐sectional study. Mediation and moderated mediation models were applied.ResultsThe association between chronotype and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by sleep quality, and the direct and indirect effects were moderated by resilience. The negative correlation between chronotype and depressive symptoms was significant in students with low levels of resilience compared with moderate/high levels. The positive correlation between sleep quality and depressive symptoms was strongest in low‐level resilience students.ConclusionThis study reveals that greater eveningness is associated with poorer sleep quality among 1st‐year college students, which may lead to severer depression, and highlights the importance of resilience training in reducing depressive symptoms.
