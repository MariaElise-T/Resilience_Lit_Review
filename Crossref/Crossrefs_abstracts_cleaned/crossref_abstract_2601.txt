A common part in lightweight floor structures is resilient channels between the joists and the ceiling. The purpose of the channels is to lower impact sound transmission in a broad frequency band. The channels are normally complicated to describe accurately from a structural acoustic point of view. The intention in this paper is to describe the channels by means of a simple structural acoustical model. The channels are divided into two types of elements. The first element is a beam. The second con-stitutes the mounting of the channels to the joist. The two elements are treated and analyzed both separately and connected to each other. The measurements are done by mainly measuring the accelerations on stiff bodies on the top and bottom of the test sample. The procedure is then repeated with a new set of stiff bodies. From these measured values (four different) one can determine the global two-port description. As a check there is also the reciprocity. As a comparison a method is used where the actual point force acting on the spring is measured and used. The model can be used as a base for analyzing the acoustical behavior of the resilient channels.
