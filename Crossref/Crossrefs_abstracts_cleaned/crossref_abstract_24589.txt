 We demonstrate that individual differences in physical activity levels coincide with lower limb corticospinal excitability. Such use-dependent corticospinal excitability directly relates to resilience and physical performance during a 5-day simulation of military operational stress with caloric restriction, sleep restriction and disruption, and heavy physical and cognitive exertion.
