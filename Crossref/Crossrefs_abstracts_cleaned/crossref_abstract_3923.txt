The goal of this study is to figure out how resilient families who get the Gemilang Social Safety Net (JPS) are in terms of physical resilience, economic resilience, social psychological and sociocultural resilience, and family resilience based on each type of work. Another part of this study will look at how income, the number of people living with you, and how many times you’ve been given JPS Gemilang affect your physical resilience. This is a quantitative study. The people who took part in this study were people who had JPS Gemilang stage III in the province of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB). Samples were chosen by a method called stratified random sampling. This study used the Treebox Method and multiple regression analysis to figure out how total income, number of dependents, and number of times receiving JPS Gemilang affected physical endurance, economic resilience, socio-psychological, and socio-cultural resilience, as well as how many times they were given the JPS Gemilang drug. According to a study done by looking at 100 samples, each person who gets JPS Gemilang has a high level of family resilience. This is true for the physical, economic, socio-psychological, and socio-cultural aspects that make up a person’s family. All of JPS Gemilang are in the top group. It doesn’t matter what job you do; your family is going to be able to handle it. People who work as professional staff, such as honorary teachers, honorary staff members, and teachers, do a lot of work that helps families be more resilient in general, but when they look at each of these things individually, they’re in the middle. Physical resilience, economic resilience, socio-psychological and socio-cultural resilience don’t seem to be affected by income, number of dependents, or number of times JPS Gemilang has been given to people. This is based on statistics.
