 Increasing occurrences of natural disturbances, including windstorms and high snow cover, and supply chain risks lead to severe irregularities in wood harvest and transport. To overcome resulting supply difficulties, innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings. Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators, facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, workshops conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and sustainability.
