This study explores the correlation between the resilience of therapists and the primary capacities of Nossrat Peseschkian’s Positive Psychotherapy theory. The aim of the study is to examine whether the developmental state of these capacities, related to the emotional aspects of an individual, can work towards increasing the resilience of therapists. A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect and analyze numerical data using questionnaires, to examine the relationship between primary capacities as an independent variable and resilience as a dependent variable. The study included 93 participants, psychotherapists from Greece, Romania, UK, Spain, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Austria, all of them over 24 years of age with more than 1 year of experience as psychotherapists. A statistically significant correlation was found between the therapists’ primary capacities and resilience. Therapists with a higher level of primary capacities were more likely to be resilient in the face of adversity. This suggests that developing primary capacities can help therapists cope with the challenges of their work and maintain their well-being.
