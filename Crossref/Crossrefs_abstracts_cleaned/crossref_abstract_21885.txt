There are several reasons that have been identified as contributing factors to the dropout of Indian students particularly in the secondary schools. Among them is the problem of lack of self-resilience that causes students to overcome the challenges of life and drop out of school. This study aims to examine the influence of self-esteem among Indian students in dropout in Kuala Muda district. The objectives of the study were to identify patterns and characteristics of resilience, to what extent are aspects of student self-resilience influencing dropout and to identify strategies for enhancing student self-esteem. The researcher applies dimensions of self-resilience as in the Masten & Reed Resilience Model. The scope of the study was focused on Indian students in Kuala Muda District and the study sample was limited to five respondents only as this study applied a qualitative study using the interview method. Respondents will be interviewed more than once if it is necessary to clearly identify the nature of the respondents' self-resilience. This research uses student interviewing and observation methods.
