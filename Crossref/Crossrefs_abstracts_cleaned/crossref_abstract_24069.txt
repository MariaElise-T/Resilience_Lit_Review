AbstractFOXO3 is a ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in response to cellular stress caused by nutrient deprivation, inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, radiation, hypoxia, and other factors. We showed previously that the association of inherited FOXO3 variants with longevity was the result of partial protection against mortality risk posed by aging-related life-long stressors, particularly cardiometabolic disease. We then referred to the longevity-associated genotypes as conferring “mortality resilience.” Serum proteins whose levels change with aging and are associated with mortality risk may be considered as “stress proteins.” They may serve as indirect measures of life-long stress. Our aims were to (1) identify stress proteins that increase with aging and are associated with an increased risk of mortality, and (2) to determine if FOXO3 longevity/resilience genotype dampens the expected increase in mortality risk they pose. A total of 4500 serum protein aptamers were quantified using the Somalogic SomaScan proteomics platform in the current study of 975 men aged 71–83 years. Stress proteins associated with mortality were identified. We then used age-adjusted multivariable Cox models to investigate the interaction of stress protein with FOXO3 longevity-associated rs12212067 genotypes. For all the analyses, the p values were corrected for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate. This led to the identification of 44 stress proteins influencing the association of FOXO3 genotype with reduced mortality. Biological pathways were identified for these proteins. Our results suggest that the FOXO3 resilience genotype functions by reducing mortality in pathways related to innate immunity, bone morphogenetic protein signaling, leukocyte migration, and growth factor response.
