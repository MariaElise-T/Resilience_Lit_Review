Background and Aims: This paper aim to investigate that teachers in special education schools have poor teacher resilience, mainly in the form of psychological stress that leads to mental health problems and consequent poor teaching effectiveness.
Methods: Through the quantitative approach, this paper investigates the phenomenon.
Results: The results suggest that special education schools should develop a comprehensive support system for in-service teachers in their administration based on the interaction of the systems within, between, beyond, and the cross system.
Conclusion: It is hoped that through the adaptation of classroom teaching methods and materials to the realities of special education, collaboration between general education teachers and special education teachers, and the establishment of a school culture that respects individual differences, the aim is to enhance the teacher resilience of teachers in special education schools.
