Objective:  This descriptive study was carried out for determining the anxiety, depression and psychological resilience levels of mothers with children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Material and Method: Study population was comprised of mothers with children diagnosed with ADHD who applied to a state hospital in central Gaziantep province for outpatient treatment during April – August 2017, whereas the number of samples was determined as 54 according to power analysis. The study was carried out with 163 mothers.“Sociodemographic Questionnaire”, “Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale”, “Beck Anxiety Scale” and “Psychological Resilience Scale for Adults” were used for obtaining the required data. The data were analyzed using SPSS Windows version 24.0 software.
Results: It was determined that the depression and anxiety levels of mothers with children diagnosed withADHD are at a low level, while their psychological resilience levels are good.A statistically significant relationship was determined between the mental health state of mothers and the adaptation of the child to the environment and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety ScaleandPsychological Resilience Scale (p<0.05).
Conclusion: It should be kept in mind that having a child diagnosed with ADHD may cause mothers to experience mental issues such as anxiety and depression while also decreasing their psychological resilience.Thus, the importance of carrying out psychological assessments not only for the child but also on the parents with emphasis on mothers should not be ignored during the treatment process.
