The purpose of the present study was to translate Gender Minority Stress & Resilience Scale (GMSR; Testa, 2014) into Urdu language for construct validity of the scale for gender nonconforming individuals living in Pakistani culture. This purpose was accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, the GMSR Scale was translated in to Urdu language by following the steps of back translation method suggested by Brislin (1972).To establish the construct validity of GMSR Scale, data was collected in two phases, first from transgender community to determine convergent validity of the scale, in second stage from gender nonconformist individuals living in general population, a total of 420 gender nonconformist individuals,  males(n =215) and females (n = 205)  from  different  cities including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot and surrounding of these cities. Data was collected through snowball sampling from all these cities. Study participants were informed about the nature of the study and signed consent was obtained. Data was analyzed to establish construct validity of Urdu version of GMSR Scale. Results indicate that all scales and respective items of the Urdu version of original GMSR Scale show good fit.

This study facilitated us to establish a valid and reliable measure for upcoming studies on Gender diversity and gender nonconformity in Pakistan using GMSR Scale.
