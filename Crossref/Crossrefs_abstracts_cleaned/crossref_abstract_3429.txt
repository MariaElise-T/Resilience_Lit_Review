<h4>EXCERPT </h4>
<p>The eagle represents strength, vision, and endurance; unaffected by the storms, it soars above. How is it that some children bounce back from adversity and persevere through difficult times? In one word: resiliency. In addition, how does a child&rsquo;s resiliency align with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), while remaining true to culturally competent care of a child with traditional Native American roots? This article will explore this and address the bridging of traditions with the Western world of therapy. </p>
