Purpose This study analyzed the effect of emergency nurses’ psychological resilience on their thanatophobic behaviors. Methods The research was conducted with 156 emergency nurses. In the data collection process, the Socio-Demographic Information Form, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Thanatophobia Scale were used. Results It was found that emergency nurses had medium-level psychological resilience and high-level thanatophobia. Besides, it was discerned that there was a moderate negative relationship between psychological resilience and thanatophobia (r:−.643, p: 0.000). Lastly, as per the simple linear regression analysis, it was identified that the predictor variable of psychological resilience accounted for 40.9% of the variance in the predicted variable of thanatophobia ( R2:.409, p: 0.000). Practice Implications Emergency nurses, who are faced with many negative situations, need to have a high level of psychological resilience in order to get out of the mental state brought by negative conditions as soon as possible, and it is recommended to carry out applications to increase psychological resilience.
