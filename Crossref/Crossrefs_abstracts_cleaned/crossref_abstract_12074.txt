In this study, children's psychological resilience was used as an intermediate variable to explore the relationship between fathers' participation in parenting, children's psychological resilience, and their approach to earning. This study used the method of the questionnaire survey in which 421 fathers and their children aged 3-6 from three kindergartens in an urban village demolition and reconstruction area of a particular city in Hebei Province were selected as the research objects. The results show that the participation of fathers in parenting and the development of kids' approach to earning are at the upper middle level, and the overall development of children's psychological resilience is usually distributed. There is a significant correlation between father's participation in parenting, children's psychological resilience, and children's approach to earning, and psychological resilience plays a completely mediating role between father's participation in parenting and children's approach to earning. It is recommended that "Second Generation Demolition" fathers adopt diversified participation and parenting paths to cultivate good learning habits for children. Specifically, strengthening family protective factors dominated by "Second Generation Demolition" fathers to stimulate children's learning potential and encouraging "Second Generation Demolition" fathers to share their own growth experience with young children and build up their self-confidence in learning can help.
