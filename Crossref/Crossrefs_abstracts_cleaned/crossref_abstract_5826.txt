IntroductionEach individual experience cancer in a different way. While some perceive cancer as a complex and traumatic experience by developing some psychosocial and additional physical problems, others overcome cancer-related difficulties by gaining benefits such as post-traumatic growth (PTG) owing to their resilience. Resilience and PTG that are very valuable concepts in human life to adapt positively to cancer process have relations which need to be better understood.ObjectivesWe aimed to provide a better understanding of relations between resilience and PTG and relations of these two concepts with cancer experience.MethodsLiterature review.ResultsSuccessful adjustment to life-threatening illnesses such as cancer, require resilience. On the other hand, resilience provides a barrier toward stressors by helping improvement of PTG and so, is an antecedent factor of PTG. PTG ensures a deeper perspective and strength to people after traumatic events. Hence, individuals having higher levels of PTG feel powerful enough to handle the problems in their life and can easily adapt to cancer process by focusing on the positive outcomes of trauma, having improved coping mechanisms and an improved psychological well-being.ConclusionsResilience and PTG have strong mutual relations and this phenomenon should be considered for a qualified cancer care.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
