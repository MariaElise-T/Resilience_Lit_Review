AbstractMental health nurses (MHNs) frequently face emotional adversity and stressors at work that can negatively impact their psychological well‐being and result in mental distress. This can affect their capacity for therapeutic work, professional relationships, and overall work performance. In the context of work, resilience is a dynamic process of positive adaptation to adversity that can lead to psychological well‐being and increased work performance. There is limited knowledge, however, on MHNs’ psychological well‐being and resilience from an Australian perspective. This study aimed to investigate the levels of, and relationships between, psychological well‐being, mental distress, and workplace resilience in Australian MHNs. A cross‐sectional online survey using Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well‐being (PWS) 18, Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS) 21, and Resilience at Work measures was completed by registered nurses (n = 482) working in a mental health setting or role. Mean scores were 85.38 for psychological well‐being and 70.27 for workplace resilience, with more than half reporting levels above the mean. However, some participants scored in the severe to extremely severe categories for depression (7.8%), anxiety (8.7%) or stress (7.3%). Psychological well‐being had strong positive and negative associations, respectively, with workplace resilience (r = 0.571, P < 0.01) and depression (r = −0.563, P < 0.01). Having a postgraduate specialist qualification was positively associated with psychological well‐being. Postgraduate speciality education may be a key protective factor that can increase MHNs’ psychological well‐being. Strengthening workplace resilience is an important strategy for organizations to implement to support MHNs’ psychological well‐being and reduce the risk of mental distress.
