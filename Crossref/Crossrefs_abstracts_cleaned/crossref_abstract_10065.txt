Abstract
From 2009 to 2017, there were more and more climate disasters which has caused serious damages in campuses, especially the heavy rain, flooding, debris flow in summer and long-term drought in winter. Therefore, based on the successes of small scaled experiments and solutions, MOE start the demonstration campus project in the year of 2018 to make a holistic solution demo site in typical aspect which can be the liveable learning centre for all. The Taikang elementary school in the countryside of Tainan was selected. Goals were set to fully demonstrate both rainwater and grey water resilience and its enhanced usage in the campus. There are four goals: 1. reduce of use and disaster impact, 2. full water absorption ability of all infrastructures from building to site, 3. bioclimate control by introducing green land and water areas to cool down the campus, and 4. maximized reusability. The campus has been reorganized by introducing a holistic water system with large underground water storage rooms underneath both buildings and playground runways paved with demolished concrete gravels, and a reconnected water circulation system for stormwater management and natural infiltration irrigation. Supported by the participation of community, the total cost of the system was a staggering 200,000 USD. The changes were obvious from the taps to the entire system integrated with environmental education. In comparison to previous situations, the campus can withstand heavy rainfall over 80 mm/hr for three hours without flooding, meanwhile providing more than 90% of all the irrigation water needed to water the green lands the entire year. Moreover, the natural cooling system of green lands and water areas provides a cool breeze for natural ventilated classrooms.
