The main purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between hope, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience levels in parents having disability children, and also to make a comparison of the levels of hope, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience between parents having disability children and parents having normal children. With ease of accessibility sampling, parents having disability children (Ndis=174) and parents having normal children (Nnor=99) from KÃ¼tahya were selected to gather data. 220 participants were female, while 53 were male (Ntotal=273). In this research, the Integrative Hope Scale, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale and Resilience Appraisal Scale were applied in order to determine the levels of hope, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience of the parents. As a result, the parents having disability children were observed to have higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty and lower levels of hope and resilience than parents having normal children. Moreover, there are statistically significant relationships between hope, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience. Finally, having disability children and disability types are the important factors for high intolerance of uncertainty and low hope and resilience levels.
