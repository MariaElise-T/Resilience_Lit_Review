The key objective of this research study is to delve into the factors affecting supply chain resilience to enhance supply chain performance through the mediation of supply chain resilience. A quantitative method of research was applied to perform this particular research. Data collection was performed using the questionnaire technique. As it was impossible to collect data from every member of the targeted population, a sample of data was calculated using G*power software and a sample size of 129 respondents. It was concluded that supply chain artificial intelligence, adaptive capability, and collaboration positively and significantly influence supply chain resilience and performance. At the same time, supply chain resilience also positively impacts supply chain performance. Thus, adopting resilience and other dynamic capacities can enhance organizational and supply chain performance. This research study provides insight to the manufacturing firms' practitioners and managers for improving their resilience level in the supply chain. This specific research study plays a significant role in literature by highlighting the concept of supply chain resilience and the supply chain performance of organizations.
