Given that mankind has occasionally been exposed to the devastation of catastrophic proportions throughout its history (extreme weather events, natural dis-asters, bioterrorism, and pandemics are having an increased global impact), which are increasing in the 20th century due to climate change, the risk reduction measures are being taken at the global level to reduce the severity of the consequences. Natural and technological disasters in the European countries have caused significant loss of life and damage to structures and infrastructure, which has led to the ratification of conventions at the world level in the field of disaster preparedness (Hyogo Framework for Action and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Management). Hospitals and other healthcare facilities are amongst those most jeopardized. The paper gives an overview of the methodology in the field of defining the resilience of healthcare facilities through determining the hospital safety index. Through the application of this and other methodologies in a case study conducted in Serbia, the paper examines the direct correlations between hospital safety index and climate change. Paper gives the results of hospital safety index calculation considering modules 2-4 and possibilities for the potential use of the module 1 (research on hazards) in separate evaluation.
