The study on employees Resiliency and LGUs readiness to work from home was conducted in the local government in the Municipality of Malita, Davao Occidental. The study will be quantitative in nature and will employ a descriptive correlational research design. This will involve the systematic investigation of the nature of relationships or associations between and among dependent and independent variables and is most commonly used when seeking a statistical relationship between two variables without manipulating the data themselves. Since social support achieved the lowest rate, training in negotiations and resolving conflicts should be undergone by the LGU officials. As confidence is achieved at the lowest level, the LGU officials need to know its meaning and open themselves to a communication structure that allows employees to participate. Moreover, since the construct of purposefulness is the best predictor of employees readiness to work from home, The LGU officials need to incorporate team-building activities through online or virtual platforms as a major component in improving the office climate in a workplace, then identify areas needing the most improvement and introduce team-building techniques. Hence, further studies related to this topic are hereby recommended.
