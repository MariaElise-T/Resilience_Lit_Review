 Although there is some evidence that psychological resilience may “buffer” against depression following major stressors, no data have been reported on the nature and variability of this buffering effect among prostate cancer patients during the 5 years following their initial diagnosis. Patients from two sites in Australia and who had received their initial diagnosis within 5 years ( n = 255) were surveyed, and the results indicated that there was a significant inverse relationship between resilience and depression in the overall data, but that was mostly accounted for by a single factor of the resilience scale (“Confidence to cope with change”). Variability in that buffering effect was noted over time since diagnosis, with peaks during the first 6 months, at 24 and 60 months. These findings support the argument to develop focused psychiatric interventions at various periods following a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
