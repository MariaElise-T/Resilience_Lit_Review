This research aims to analyse the relationship between Individual Resilience, as measured by the CD-RISC-10 scale (Campbell and Stein, 2007) and Community Resilience, as measured by the Index of Perceived Community Resilience (IPCR, Kulig et al., 2013), in a sample of 387 people living on the island of Bali (Indonesia). The population of this area regularly faces the consequences of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and severe floods. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the IPCR was carried out, which confirmed the multidimensional structure of Community Resilience originally proposed by its authors. Results also showed that there is a positive and moderate correlation between Individual and Community Resilience. Specifically, regression analysis showed that the three Community Resilience factors explain 32% of Individual Resilience, although Leadership followed by Community Engagement are the two factors that provide the most explanatory power.
