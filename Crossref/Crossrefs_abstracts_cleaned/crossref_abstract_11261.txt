The current study uses a strengths-based lens to explore the resilience narratives of five Holocaust survivors and their perspectives on experiences of resilience during and after the Holocaust. UsingInterpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), transcripts of one to one and a half hour interviews were analyzed by a team of three researchers. Overarching emergent themes included: Definition of Resilience, Adversities, Attitude After Overcoming Adversity, Method of Resilience, Adhering to Cultural Values, and Beliefs About Others’ Experience of Resilience. Subthemes and tertiary categories also evolved and are discussed. Findings are interpreted with the acknowledgement of systemic oppression and overcoming, including participants’ development critical consciousness (Freire, 1975/2000). Implications for current societal circumstances and issues are discussed.
