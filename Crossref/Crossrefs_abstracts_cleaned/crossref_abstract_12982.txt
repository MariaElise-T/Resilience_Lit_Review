Summary This study analyzes whether resilience, defined as a process rather than as a static response over time, is associated with social work. The main aim was to determine whether social work increases resilience in students and professionals during training and when practicing the profession. The sample consisted of 613 university students and professionals from Malaga (Spain). Findings The longitudinal study of social work students indicated statistically significant within-subjects differences during their university course in the components of resilience (personal competence, acceptance of self and life, and social support). Regarding professionals, the results show a positive association between years of experience and their acceptance of self and life and coping with workplace adversity. Applications Implications include the need to focus on the development of positive experiences during training and the practice of social work, such as the capacity to be resilient.
