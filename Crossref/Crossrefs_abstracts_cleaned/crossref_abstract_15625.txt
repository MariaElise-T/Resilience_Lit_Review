In today's dynamic and competitive business landscape, innovation plays a pivotal role in driving organizational success. Central to this process is the concept of innovative work behavior (IWB), which holds significant importance in generating and implementing novel ideas, processes, and products. Extensive research has consistently underscored a positive association between innovation and IWB. Two key factors influencing IWB are perceived organizational support (POS) and resilience (RES). POS encompasses employees' perceptions of the organization's support and care, while RES reflects their capacity to adapt and recover in the face of challenges. This study delves into the interconnections among perceived organizational support, resilience, and IWB, with a specific focus on investigating the mediating role of resilience. To unravel these relationships, a comprehensive survey was conducted, involving 355 support staff members at Rajamangala University of Technology in Thailand. Utilizing the Process macro for SPSS, the gathered data was meticulously analyzed. The results shed light on positive correlations between perceived organizational support, resilience, and IWB. Furthermore, the study successfully highlights the significant mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between perceived organizational support and IWB. The contributions of this research are twofold: firstly, it emphasizes the pivotal role of resilience as a mediator among support staff within a university setting. Secondly, the findings underscore the importance of cultivating supportive and resilient work environments to foster and encourage IWB among employees. However, while this study provides valuable insights, it is essential to expand the scope of research in the future. Exploring various employee types and organizations would enhance the wider applicability of the conclusions drawn here. In conclusion, this investigation provides a deeper understanding of the intricate connections between perceived organizational support, resilience, and innovative work behavior. It underscores the importance of building supportive and resilient workplace cultures, which can serve as catalysts for driving innovation and organizational success.
