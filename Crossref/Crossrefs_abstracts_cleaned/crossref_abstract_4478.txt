This study explores how the climate factor impacts the resilience of the US banking system. Using an extended sample of banks, spanning the period 2000-2020, the findings document a negative effect of this climate factor on banksâ€™ resilience. They also highlight the role of climate risk over the post-global financial crisis period. The results could have a substantial value as climate conditions can serve as an early warning system for policymakers and regulators in detecting signs of weakness, calling for immediate actions to mitigate potential vulnerabilities of banks.
