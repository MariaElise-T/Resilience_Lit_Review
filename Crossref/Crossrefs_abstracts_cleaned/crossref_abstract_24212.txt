AbstractIndividuals age at vastly different rates resulting in significant within‐population heterogeneity in health and aging outcomes. This diversity in health and aging trajectories has rarely been investigated among low‐income aging populations that have experienced substantial hardships throughout their lifecourses. Utilizing 2006–2019 data from the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health and estimating group‐based trajectory models, our analyses identified three distinct lifecourse health trajectories: (1) comparatively good initial mental and physical health that persisted throughout the lifecourse (“resilient aging”), (2) relatively good initial mental and physical health that started to deteriorate during mid‐adulthood (“accelerated aging”), and (3) poor initial mental and physical health that further declined over the lifecourse (“aging with persistently poor health”). For both physical and mental health, men were more likely to enjoy resilient aging than women. Predictors other than gender of trajectory membership sometimes confirmed, and sometimes contradicted, hypotheses derived from high‐income country studies. Our analyses highlight the long arm of early life conditions and gender in determining aging trajectories and show that a nontrivial subpopulation is characterized by aging with persistently poor health. The study uncovers widening gaps in health outcomes between those who age with resilience and those who experience accelerated aging.
