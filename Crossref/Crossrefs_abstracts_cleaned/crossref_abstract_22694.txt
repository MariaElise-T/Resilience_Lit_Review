 This study examined whether trajectories of perceived unmet needs for Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) were associated with life satisfaction among Chinese older adults and whether the association was moderated by psychological resilience. Data came from five waves (2005-2018) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Latent class growth analysis revealed three distinct trajectories of perceived unmet HCBS needs: “increasing” ( n = 977, 36.24%), “persistent” ( n = 570, 21.14%), and “decreasing” ( n = 1149, 42.62%). Multiple regression estimates showed that the increasing group was associated with lower life satisfaction, and the association was moderated by psychological resilience, especially for older adults who were male, living in rural, and oldest-old. Results indicate that inequalities in cumulative exposure to perceived unmet HCBS needs may further lead to increasing inequalities in life satisfaction. Interventions focused on minimizing the provision-need gap of HCBS and enhancing personal resilience should be considered to improve the life satisfaction of older adults.
