Microbes in the 21st century are understood as symbionts ‘completing’ the human ‘superorganism’ (Homo sapiens plus microbial partners-in-health). This paper addresses a significant paradox: despite the vast majority of our genes being microbial, the lack of routine safety testing for the microbiome has led to unintended collateral side effects from pharmaceuticals that can damage the microbiome and inhibit innate ‘colonization resistance’ against pathobionts. Examples are discussed in which a Microbiome First Medicine approach provides opportunities to ‘manage our microbes’ holistically, repair dysbiotic superorganisms, and restore health and resilience in the gut and throughout the body: namely, managing nosocomial infections for Clostridioides difficile and Staphylococcus aureus and managing the gut and neural systems (gut–brain axis) in autism spectrum disorder. We then introduce a risk analysis tool: the evidence map. This ‘mapping’ tool was recently applied by us to evaluate evidence for benefits, risks, and uncertainties pertaining to the breastmilk ecosystem. Here, we discuss the potential role of the evidence map as a risk analysis methodology to guide scientific and societal efforts to: (1) enhance ecosystem resilience, (2) ‘manage our microbes’, and (3) minimize the adverse effects of both acute and chronic diseases.
