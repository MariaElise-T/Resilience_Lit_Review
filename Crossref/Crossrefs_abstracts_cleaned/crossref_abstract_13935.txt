Human values and affective traits were found to predict attitudes toward the use of different types of knowledge-based theory through creative climate. In this study (N =329), we aimed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of those predictors toward use in a structural equation model (SEM), providied a better overview of a possible structural path that drives to such antecedents for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Bangladesh. Precisely, we predicted and found that the relations between the variables and impact of different variables were modeled and tested by applying SEM. Based on the questionnaires survey on SMEs in Bangladesh, this empirical study indicates that all the predictor variables significantly influence the endogenous variables except knowledge management (KM) and employee resilience (ER), and creative climate (CC) and organizational resilience (OR). The study provides several theoretical and practical implications for further research.
