Most tourism destinations in Switzerland are fragmented. The result is that actors along the customerâ€™s journey intervene in a disordered way. To create a smart integrated tourism destination, we posited that collaboration between these different actors should be trained upstream, in the design process. However, this training requires a laboratory independent of day-to-day business activity and allowing a type of rehearsal by the local stakeholders in the tourism industry. Through a case study based on SWISSPEAK Resorts (SPR), this research article illustrates that merely creating a digital marketplace for tourism is not enough to ensure a truly smart, integrated customer experience. Based on consecutive pre-experiments, we concluded that digital trust was of primary importance for the resilience of a smart integrated tourism destination and that orchestrating and rehearsing it was essential.
