AbstractIn the continental cold and humid areas of northeastern North America, climate change by mid‐century may increase the yield potential of perennial forage species as a result of increased temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and a longer growing season compared to the 1990−2000 period. More winter thaws and less snow cover along with more summer drought events, however, may reduce winter survival and summer regrowth, thus potentially reducing the persistence of perennial forages over time. Based on nearly two decades of research on the effects of climate change on forages in cold and humid areas of northeastern North America, through field experiments and modeling, we summarize in this review the expected effects of climate change on forage production in terms of yield, nutritive value, and winter survival. We also propose a set of 12 adaptation and resilience‐building strategies for forage systems that can be implemented at the field and farm levels. Research priorities for the future, including the improvement of species, forage management practices, and modeling tools, are also identified. Implementing strategies to alleviate or take advantage of the effects of a changing climate may improve productivity and resilience of well‐adapted forage systems in cold and humid areas.
