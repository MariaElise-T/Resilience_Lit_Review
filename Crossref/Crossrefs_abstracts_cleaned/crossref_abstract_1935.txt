The ordinary Portland cement (OPC) component of concrete is the highest contributor to concreteâ€™s cost and carbon footprint. Historically, code-writing organizations have required a high volume of paste in concrete mixtures by imposing minimum limits on the OPC content for a given application. However, high paste contents can result in dimensional instability, higher costs, higher carbon footprints, and lower durability. Minimizing the OPC content in concrete can provide economic, durability, and sustainability benefits. This study hypothesizes that the amount of OPC required to achieve some required fresh and hardened characteristics is highly dependent on the aggregate characteristics, supplementary cementing material (SCM) characteristics, and proportions of these. Given this, this research proposes using the amount of voids in the aggregate system (AV), or more specifically the paste volume-to-aggregate void ratio (PV/AV); SCM reactivity; and the SCM replacement level as key parameters to proportion concrete mixtures with minimum OPC contents to meet sustainability, economic, and resilience (SER) requirements. A new mixture proportioning procedure, referred to here as the SER proportioning method, is developed in this study based on assessing AV and identifying an optimal PV/AV that satisfies the required concrete characteristics. The results show that implementing the SER mixture proportioning method and including SCMs, or more specifically off-spec fly ashes (OFAs), can lead to significant reductions in the paste content and associated reductions in the cost and embodied carbon footprint of concrete.
