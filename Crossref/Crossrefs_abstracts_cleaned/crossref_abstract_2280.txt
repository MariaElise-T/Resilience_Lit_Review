 The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak alarmingly threats the mental health and functioning of people globally. The present study aims to examine the moderated mediation role of resilient mindset and loneliness in the association of coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. We recruited 394 undergraduate students from a state university in Türkiye, ranging in age between 18 and 47 years ( M = 22.76, SD = 3.88; 65% female). The main results revealed that resilient mindset mediated the relationship between coronavirus-related stress and depressive symptoms. Moreover, loneliness moderated the mediating effect of resilient mindset in the coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms association. Taken together, these findings pointed out that the effects of the coronavirus stress on depressive symptoms can be captured better by underlying psychological mechanisms, namely resilient mindset and loneliness.
