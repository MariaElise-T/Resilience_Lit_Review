 8562  Background: Nal-IRI is investigated as monotherapy in patients with SCLC who progressed on or after platinum regimen. The RESILIENT study is a Part 1 study of a Phase 2/3 trial to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Irinotecan Liposome Injection in patients with SCLC. Methods: Nal-IRI is evaluated in patients ≥18 yrs with advanced SCLC with an ECOG performance status ≤1 and adequate organ function; prior exposure to immunotherapy is allowed. Safety and tolerability at dose levels of 85 mg/m2 and 70 mg/m2 are the primary endpoints, with assessment of exploratory efficacy signal. Results: At 24 Dec 2018 safety cutoff 12 patients in Part 1 received ≥1 dose of nal-IRI (Cohort 1 [C-1] at 85 mg/m2 dose n=4; Cohort 2 [C-2] at 70 mg/m2 dose n=8; median age 60.0 yrs; range 49–73 yrs). Three patients experienced ≥1 DLT (Cohort 1 n=3/4; Cohort 2 n=0/8). Most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (any grade): diarrhea (91.7%), nausea (58.3%), vomiting (41.7%), decreased appetite (58%), abdominal pain (33%) manageable by antidiarrheal regimen and antiemetics; as well as fatigue (50%) and asthenia (37.5%). Overall, hematologic toxicity was neutropenia (any grade) at 16.7% and anemia (any grade) at 16.7%. At 11 Dec 2018 efficacy cutoff the best objective response was partial response (PR) at 33.3% in 4/12 patients (C-1 n=1/4; C-2 n=3/8), median time to response was 6 wks. Overall disease control rate (DCR) was 58.3%; progressive disease (PD) was observed in 2 patients (16.7%), and 3 patients were non-evaluable (25%). Conclusions: Initial assessment suggests that nal-IRI at 70 mg/m2 dose given bi-weekly is well-tolerated and has promising antitumor activity in patients with SCLC who progressed on or after platinum regimen. Part 1 dose expansion is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCTN03088813. [Table: see text]
