Urban poverty in Malaysia has become a more prominent problem that is increasingly risking the quality of life. Meanwhile, resilience plays a very vital role in poor urban communities. Poverty will hinder sustainable development and a better quality of life. Improving the quality of life has always been the focus of the Malaysian government. Recent years have seen attempts to address this need for more community resilience research that investigates the impacts of poverty. Thus, examining a communityâ€™s resilience to poverty will produce communities that are resilient to urban pressures and challenges to improve their quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the social resilience of urban poverty toward quality of life in Kuala Lumpur. This study showed that higher resilience in poor communities can be justified by determining social resilience, such as participation in the community, decision-making and community trust. This study used quantitative methods for data collection. The questionnaire was administered using a sample of 400 respondents from urban poor households in Kuala Lumpur. Descriptive and correlation regression analysis was in this study. The findings of this study showed that the relationship between social resilience, participation in the community of the urban poor in Kuala Lumpur, and quality of life is significant.
