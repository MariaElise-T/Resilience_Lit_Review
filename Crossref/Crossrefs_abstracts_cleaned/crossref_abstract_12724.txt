Abstract
This study aimed to explore the levels of resilience and hope among Yazidi women who survived captivity by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and to examine its relationship with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety, and depressive symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, 139 formerly enslaved Yazidi women were assessed. The mean scores of resilience and hope were below the suggested cutoff means (M = 2.47, SD = 0.48, R = 1–5) and (M = 31.6, SD = 11.7, R = 8–64), respectively. Sociodemographic variables were not related to resilience and hope, other than those women who stayed in captivity for more than a 3-year period who reported significantly lower levels of hope (M = 28.36, SD = 11.69). Formerly enslaved Yazidi women who display higher levels of PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression exhibit significantly lower levels of resilience and hope. Resilience and hope are therefore important concepts to explore in traumatized populations.
