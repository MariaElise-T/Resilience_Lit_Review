The study of intentional attackshas become an important issue onthe research of complex networks. In this paper, we study the resilience of networks, introducing the parameters that describe the attacks effect and the parameters that measure the priority of intentional attacks. Weestablish analgorithm to analysis the intentional attack phenomenon and present the numerical simulation.
