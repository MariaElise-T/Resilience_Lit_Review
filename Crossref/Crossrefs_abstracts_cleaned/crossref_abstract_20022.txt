Background: Stroke patients may suffer from a variety of symptoms which can result in sleep disturbance and post-stroke depression (PSD). Whereas, resilience can alleviate sleep disturbance and help maintain well-being after stroke.Objective: The aim of this study is to explore whether resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between sleep disturbance and PSD of stroke patients in China.Methods: A cross-sectional study with a multi-stage sampling was carried out in Liaoning Rehabilitation Center and the Third People's Hospital of Chongqing in China from May to September 2019. A total of 353 stroke patients were enrolled in this study. Structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between sleep disturbance and PSD.Results: The prevalence of PSD of stroke patients was 34.56%. Sleep disturbance contributed most to the variance of PSD and had a significantly positive association with PSD among stroke patients (P &lt; 0.01). Resilience was negatively associated with PSD, and acted as a mediator between sleep disturbance and PSD (a * b = 0.201, BCa 95% CI: 0.156~0.254).Conclusions: The prevalence of PSD was high among the Chinese stroke patients. Sleep disturbance was highly associated with PSD, resulting in the increased risk of PSD. Furthermore, resilience has a mediating effect on the relationship between sleep disturbance and PSD, and could reduce the negative effect of sleep disturbance on the development of PSD.
