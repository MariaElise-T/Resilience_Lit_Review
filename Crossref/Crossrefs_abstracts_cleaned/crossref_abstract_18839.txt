AbstractChallenges in conceptualising resilience have impeded advancements in resilience science. In response, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a general framework for harmonising the conceptualisation of resilience as a dynamic process determined by multiple systems and levels of analysis. Consistent with the NIH Resilience Framework, this paper presents a conceptual model of resilience applied to military service members. This model encompasses four core components necessary for resilience research: (1) the presence of significant challenge, (2) successful adaptation in response to the challenge, (3) the capacity for resilience (i.e., protective factors), and (4) the processes (i.e., mechanisms) by which protective factors exert positive effects on an individual's response. Guided by this conceptual model, we outline key methodological recommendations to advance resilience research and illustrate each using the Advancing Research on Mechanisms of Resilience study as an exemplar. We emphasise the need for future research to examine resilience as a dynamic process and apply a multilevel approach. We hope to provide a basic road map to those interested in improving the rigour of future research on resilience in a military context, the results of which can inform the development of interventions.
