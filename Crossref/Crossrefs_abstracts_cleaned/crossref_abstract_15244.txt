AbstractResilience is situated at the core of the World Health Organization European policy framework for health and well‚Äêbeing and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Resilience refers to how effectively a person, group, or system deals with and recovers from challenging situations. In this paper resilience refers to the capacity of a health care professional to manage complex issues and adapt to situations successfully. This brief paper provides explicit knowledge for strengthening personal resilience in health care using the Ottawa Charter framework as a guide. Developing a resilient health care workforce should address all five Ottawa Charter areas of action, should involve multiple stakeholders, and should incorporate resilience strategies into everyday health care activities. The paper presents recommendations for future programs designed to build a resilient workforce that can provide high quality care in a sustainable manner.
