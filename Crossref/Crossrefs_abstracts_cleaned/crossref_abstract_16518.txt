 We tested the suggestion that Sense of Coherence (SOC) may enhance medical well-being by virtue of a favorably balanced profile of psychosocial assets relative to liabilities. Results derived from a sample of 81 young adults who responded to a battery of inventories supported the Psychosocial Resilience Model. Our findings provide preliminary evidence to suggest that a favorable balance between psychosocial ‘protective’ and ‘risk’ factors may, in part, help explain why people with a strong SOC enjoy high levels of medical well-being.
