This study aims to review the employee’s risks and resilience during covid-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review on scientific articles reporting risks and resilience on employees during covid-19 pandemic. We used the following keywords on Google Scholar database: “employee resilience” AND “COVID-19” and additional keywords “workers resilience” AND “COVID-19”. There were 13 articles matched criteria for review. We found that employees were at risks for increased workload and work intensity, psychological changes in the form of ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, distress, and job insecurity. Individual and organizational resilience are challenged. At the organizational level, company may adapt their corporate social responsibility (CSR), develop intervention programs for mental and physical health and well-being, create flexible working hours or arrangements, provide financial supports, and creating a safe and supportive work environment. At the individual level, applying effective coping strategies focusing on tasks, stress management, social, cognitive strategies, faith-based learning activities, and promoting meaning-based coping strategies help to build resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged individual and organizational resilience. During the pandemic, leaders play even more important role in managing employees’ resilience.
