AbstractA block‐iterative projection algorithm for solving the consistent convex feasibility problem in a finite‐dimensional Euclidean space that is resilient to bounded and summable perturbations (in the sense that convergence to a feasible point is retained even if such perturbations are introduced in each iterative step of the algorithm) is proposed. This resilience can be used to steer the iterative process towards a feasible point that is superior in the sense of some functional on the points in the Euclidean space having a small value. The potential usefulness of this is illustrated in image reconstruction from projections, using both total variation and negative entropy as the functional.
