Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper was to describe the research literature on the science of children's resilience and show its application to parenting interventions for high-risk families.

Findings
 – Substantial research evidence affirmed the importance of strengthening children's resilience in high-risk families. Details from pilot work with homeless mothers illustrated the process by which activities were included in workshops to promote children's resilience. Future work will test the efficacy of this program in a controlled study with a range of pre- and post-assessments. 


Practical implications
 – The current paper expanded the traditional focus of parent education to include strengthening children's resilience as a way to better address the myriad of critical needs faced by children and families experiencing homelessness. 


Originality/value
