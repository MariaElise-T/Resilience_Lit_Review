The speed, complexity, and all-encompassing nature of modern socioeconomic processes place high demands on such personal qualities as resilience, stress resistance, competitiveness, and the ability to self-develop and self-help. These qualities are essential for successful functioning in society and overcoming serious social challenges. According to psychologists, the modern conditions in which people live and realize themselves are extreme and stimulate the development of stress. The article aims to outline the key trends in the modern scientific literature on issues related to the formation of resilience. It is equally important to study the practical aspects of the development of this trait as one of the key factors of a successful life in modern conditions.

According to the results of the study, the main most important theoretical aspects of the issue of the formation of personality resilience in modern conditions are identified. Moreover, the viewpoints of scientists and practicing psychologists on the key aspects of this issue are studied.
