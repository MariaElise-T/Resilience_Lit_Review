Abstract
The main goal of this study is to improve mathematical resilience of prospective math teachers through the implementation of Problem-based Learning. This study is a quasi-experimental using non-random of pretest and posttest control design. 57 prospective math teachers from Universitas PGRI Semarang are taken as the sample of this study. The data needed to achieve the goal of this study are taken from documentation, observation, interviews, students’ worksheets, and pre and post responses. The results of the analysis show that mathematical resilience in prior knowledge of mathematical category of high, medium and low of the students who experienced study using Problem-based Learning and overall is improved. This students’ mathematical resilience improvement belongs to low category. This study can be taken as consideration for another researchers for doing further research which is in the same vein as this study.
