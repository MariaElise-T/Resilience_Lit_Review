 There is broad consensus in academia and practice that organizational resilience is a critical factor for organizations to cope with crises. However, despite considerable theoretical progress, empirical knowledge on the dynamics of organizational resilience remains limited. To explore facilitators and consequences of organizational resilience with a holistic approach, we report results of a mixed-methods multi-study throughout an ongoing crisis within the Pakistani textile industry. Qualitative findings indicate a broad set of organizational resilience facilitators, differentiated in respect to their content and temporal properties. Quantitative findings from longitudinal survey data suggest the pivotal importance of “soft” facilitators related to employee focus and learning orientation. In terms of consequences, results show that organizational resilience can reduce emotional exhaustion and contribute to business success. Overall, the findings are consistent with an integral understanding of organizational resilience as a meta-capability, building on a set of facilitators occurring at different time points throughout a crisis.
