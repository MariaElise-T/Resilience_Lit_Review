The purpose of the research was to develop a prediction method to prevent disruption related to temperature anomaly in the cold chain supply. The analysed data covers the period of the entire working cycle of the thermal container. In the research, automatic Big Data analysis and mathematical modelling were used to identify the disruption. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to predict possible temperature-related disruption in transport. The provided research proves that it is possible to prevent over 82% of disruptions in the cold chain. The ANN enables analyses of the temperature curve and prediction of the disruption before it occurs. The research is limited to coolbox transportation of food under -20o C, but the method could also be used for Full Transport Load (FTL) in refrigerated transport. The research is based on real data, and the developed method helps to reduce the waste in the cold chain, improve transport quality and supply chain resilience. The presented method enables not only to avoid cold chain breaks but also to reduce product damage as well as improve the transport process. It could be used by cargo forwarders, Third-Party Logistics (3PL) companies to reduce costs and waste. The literature review confirms that there is no similar method to prevent disruption in the transport chain. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for collecting data connected with Big Data analysis and ANN enables chain resilience provision.
