Executive function and resilience, both key components associated with a healthy interaction with one’s environment, have been researched alongside one another, increasingly throughout time. Psychological flexibility is also a fundamental component in mental health and wellbeing, commonly used in therapeutic techniques such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. To date, little research has focussed on the relationship between executive functioning, resilience levels, and one’s psychological flexibility. Research conducted so far has determined relationships between executive function and psychological flexibility, and both components with resilience. Future research would benefit from researching these variables together in the context of adverse life events to inform interventions that aim to improve resilience and psychological flexibility.
