Under the current climate of mental health problems, the study explores the relationship between life events and the mental health of college students. The researchers selected 595 students to fill out questionnaires for the SCL-90, ASLEC, RSCA, and SCSQ. After all, the results illustrated that negative coping is a mediation factor between life events and mental health and that resilience is a mediation factor between life events and mental health. In addition, resilience and negative coping play a chain mediation effect between life events and mental health; meanwhile, life events can influence mental health directly and indirectly through resilience and coping styles.
