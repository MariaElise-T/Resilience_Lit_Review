Abstract
Dynamic measures of resilience—the ability to resist and recover from a challenge—may be informative of the rate of aging before overt manifestations such as chronic disease, disability, and frailty. From this perspective mid-life resilience may predict longevity and late-life health. To test this hypothesis, we developed simple, reproducible, clinically relevant challenges, and outcome measures of physical resilience that revealed differences between and within age groups of genetically heterogeneous mice, and then examined associations between mid-life resilience and both lifespan and late-life measures of physiological function. We demonstrate that time to recovery from isoflurane anesthesia and weight change following a regimen of chemotherapy significantly differed among young, middle-aged, and older mice, and were more variable in older mice. Females that recovered faster than the median time from anesthesia (more resilient) at 12 months of age lived 8% longer than their counterparts, while more resilient males in mid-life exhibited better cardiac (fractional shortening and left ventricular volumes) and metabolic (glucose tolerance) function at 24 months of age. Moreover, female mice with less than the median weight loss at Day 3 of the cisplatin challenge lived 8% longer than those that lost more weight. In contrast, females who had more weight loss between Days 15 and 20 were relatively protected against early death. These data suggest that measures of physical resilience in mid-life may provide information about individual differences in aging, lifespan, and key parameters of late-life health.
