Objective: Indigenous young people are known to have adverse demographic and psychosocial factors affecting worse mental health outcomes and some household factors aiding resilience. In Australia, there has been no exploration of these factors in clinically referred Indigenous young people assessed in a culturally appropriate way. Methods: A total of 113 Indigenous children and adolescents, 217 non-Indigenous young people, age, gender, mental disorder symptom severity, symptom-linked distress and impairment matched, and 112 typically developing participants, age- and gender-matched were recruited. Cultural validity and reliability of the impairing symptoms in Indigenous young people were determined. Key demographic and psychosocial factors were compared across the three groups. Results: The Indigenous clinical group differed significantly from the other two groups that did not differ on three possibly protective measures examined. Key demographic and psychosocial risk factors in the Indigenous group differed significantly from the non-Indigenous clinical group which in turn differed from the typically developing participants. The three groups exhibited a progressively increased magnitude of difference. Conclusions: It remains imperative to nurture features that provide protection and enhance resilience for Indigenous young people and their communities. Indigenous status is linked to significant demographic and psychosocial disadvantage over and above that conferred by clinical impairment and its management. It is crucial that these features are managed and/or advocated for with those demographic and psychosocial factors of the greatest magnitude dealt with first. Future systematic investigations of the contribution of these key factors to mental health referral pathways, assessment and management are needed.
