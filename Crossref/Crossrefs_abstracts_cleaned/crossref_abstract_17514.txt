AbstractIn the last few decades, increasing research efforts have been devoted to the definition of innovative seismic resilient design strategies with the aim of reducing direct and indirect losses. Among others, the use of Friction Devices (FDs) for Beam‐to‐Column joints (BCJs) has emerged as an effective solution to ensure the damage‐free behaviour of steel Moment Resisting Frames (MRFs). Additionally, more recent research studies have revealed the benefits of replacing traditional full‐strength Column Bases (CBs) with innovative CBs promoting the residual drift reduction of steel MRFs. Additionally, several research studies developed and investigated structures that could be easily repaired after an extreme event, promoting a functional recovery of the structures and able to reinstate the original seismic performance in a short time. However, experimental research on suitable structural repair techniques is still marginal and the lack of confidence in the performance of repaired structures are relevant issues contributing to the high demolition rates. In this direction, an experimental campaign has been performed on a large‐scale steel structure equipped with BCJs with FDs and innovative CBs. Several pseudo‐dynamic tests have been performed and at the end of each test, the structure have been repaired by simply loosening the bolts of the FDs. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of repairing methodology.
