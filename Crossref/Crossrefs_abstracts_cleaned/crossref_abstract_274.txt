With the development of communication technology and computer technology, many related industries, such as multimedia entertainment, put forward higher requirements for storing and transmitting information data. The research of data compression technology has attracted more and more attention. Therefore, the error resiliency ability of data compression algorithm is particularly important. How to enhance the error resiliency of data compression communication systems has been a hot topic for researchers. This paper mainly introduces the lossless data compression technology and its basic principle and performance index. Two typical lossless compression codes, Huffman and Arithmetic coding are deeply studied, including the principle of coding and the problem of error resiliency. Huffman coding and Arithmetic coding are two very important lossless compression codes widely used. The ability to resist channel error is an important index for data compression in communication. It is of great significance to further improve the channel adaptability of data compression to study the above two kinds of codes and their ability to resist channel error.
