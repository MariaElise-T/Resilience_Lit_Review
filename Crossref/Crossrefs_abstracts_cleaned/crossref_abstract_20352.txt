(1) Background: Motivation towards sports practice is fundamental at an early age, as this can favor the integral development of the student body. (2) Methods: The main objective of this study was to describe and analyze the relationships between the different dimensions of self-concept based on motivational climate, body mass index and resilience in a sample of 203 children from the third cycle of primary education, with an age between 11 and 13 years (M = 11.54). They completed the motivational climate questionnaires (PMCSQ-2), the self-concept questionnaire (AF-5) and the questionnaire that measures resilience levels (the Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)). (3) Results: The results showed that boys are more resilient than girls and, in turn, have a greater tendency to task climate compared to them. Regarding self-concept, males presented higher scores in the academic, social and physical dimensions. In the same line as resilience, the motivational climate in males is oriented to the ego climate and the feminine to the task climate. Negative correlations of physical self-concept were found with the ego and task climate. (4) Conclusions: The task climate was identified as a predictor of resilience levels.
