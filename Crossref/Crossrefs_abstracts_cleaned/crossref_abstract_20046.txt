This paper offers an ethnographic analysis of indigenous Peruvian Amazonian youth pursuing higher education through urban migration to contribute to the resilience of their communities, place‚Äêbased livelihoods, and indigenous Amazonian identities. Youth and their communities promoted education and migration as powerful tools in the context of educational inequality, racial discrimination, and threats to their communities' ways of life from colonization and natural resource extraction.
