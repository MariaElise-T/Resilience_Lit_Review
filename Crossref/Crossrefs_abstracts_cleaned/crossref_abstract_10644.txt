Family resilience is a construct based on interactive processes occurring in the family, enabling the family to effectively overcome everyday stressors, as well as developmental and unpredictable crises. By observing how the family deals with difficulties using family resilience processes, we are able to support both parents and protect children against the harmful effects of unfavourable conditions. The aim of our research was to carry out the procedure of adaptation to the Polish language and culture of the Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire. In this study, 930 Poles participated (72.5% women), aged from 18 to 63 (M = 26.94, SD = 9.8). They filled in the questionnaire online. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the model with three factors: belief system, organisational processes, and communication processes. The model indicators were found to be well suited to the data: χ2/df = 1.12, RMSEA = 0.01, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.04. The reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of the scales was also satisfactory (0.94 for the belief systems, 0.86 for the organisational processes, and 0.94 for the communication processes). Tool validation with FRAS-PL scales showed convergence. We named the Polish version of the WFRQ Questionnaire Kwestionariusz Prężności Rodzinnej Walsh (WFRQ-PL) and found it to be a good tool for assessing the processes of family resilience in our country.
