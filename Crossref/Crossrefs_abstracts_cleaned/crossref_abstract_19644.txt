In a context prone to flood-related disasters, com munities living in vulnerable areas within important catchments like the Dijle in central Belgium have been developing strategies to mitigate, prepare for, respond to and recover from the consequences of these extreme events. The present
 study analyses the structure of the local governance model and community resilience systems concerning muddy floods in the municipalities of Beauvechain (Wallonia) and Bertem (Flanders). Data was collected through semi-structured and open-ended interviews with governmental and non-governmental
 stakeholders. The analysis reveals that both communities have developed resources, actions, competencies and infrastructure to prevent and act when muddy flood disasters occur. In this context, municipalities are at the centre of the flood-disaster risk reduction man agement strategy; however,
 stronger collaborations with local communities and other stakeholders could be developed to build resilience against future events of high magnitude. This paper recommends harmonising existing policies to foster participation, community empowerment and knowledge exchange to provide an enabling
 environment and conditions to collectively build resilience against upcoming climate change-induced disasters like muddy floods.
