Businesses that demonstrate organizational flexibility, characterized by dynamic problem-solving skills, in-house production processes, and a robust human capital, appear to be successful and resilient in times of crisis. Drawing on my fieldwork in medium-sized manufacturing companies in Emilia, Northern Italy, from June to November 2021, I investigate ideas and characteristics that shed light on good practices, key ingredients of the success of such companies, and possible future models of resilience. I employ participant observation and provide evidence taken from conversations or episodes observed, especially in one of the companies. Although greater structuring is often sought and considered the resolution of many existing problems, non-structuring is, at the same time, convenient in many circumstances. People are essential components in this dynamic organizational model, and their commitment in the organization goes far beyond contractual obligations. Their motivation stems from personal satisfaction as well as from a sense of responsibility and strong personal commitment.
