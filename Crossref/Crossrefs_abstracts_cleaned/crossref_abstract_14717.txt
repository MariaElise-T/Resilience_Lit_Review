Abstract
According to New Urban Agenda, the spatial plan has been promoted as an instrument to strengthen urban resilience. In the context of urban flood resilience, flood management measures could be incorporated into the spatial plan to address inundation and flood risks. However, the existence of a spatial plan does not necessarily reduce inundation and flood risks due to the ineffectiveness of spatial plan implementation and/or insufficient flood management measures. This study aims to examine flood management measures within Bandung’s spatial plan in achieving urban flood resilience in the future. We combine flood management measures framework and characteristics of urban system resilience as an analytical framework. The effectiveness of flood management measures is highly associated with the topographic characteristics and the combination of measures selected in suitable locations. We use thematic analysis to identify flood management measures in Bandung’s Spatial Plan and compare the result with the spatial distribution of future inundation and flood risks data from the previous study. We reveal that flood management measures in Bandung’s spatial plan have not been selected and located based on ecological constraints and future inundation information. This study demonstrates the importance of flood risks information to formulate an effective spatial plan for urban flood resilience.
