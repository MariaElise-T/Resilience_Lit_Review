The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, amplified by the Russian–Ukrainian military conflict, have had a significant impact on economies and industries around the world, with serious implications for the activities of companies, including start-ups. In this context, this paper aims to examine the challenges and critical issues faced by the managers of start-ups during crises, and to identify solutions for increasing the resilience of companies and moving towards sustainable business reconstruction. Given that there are currently only limited data related to the long-term economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on start-ups, and especially concerning the implications of the Russian–Ukrainian war, we use a qualitative research approach to explore Romanian start-up managers’ perceptions of how this difficult context affects their businesses, taking into account the economic, social, and psychological factors that affect their management. The issues faced by start-up managers in times of unprecedented crisis in recent history are highlighted. The results of the research identify response measures that can contribute to increasing companies’ resilience, helping start-up managers to overcome critical events, and making sustainable choices for subsequent business recovery and reconstruction.
