Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of coping style, self-efficacy, resilience and emotional reaction of trauma-related intrusions in young offenders. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – This is a quantitative study using questionnaires. The sample was 152 young offenders in custody who were approached in their residential hall. Upon agreeing to participate they were given 24 hours to complete the questionnaire pack and returned these to the researcher at a designated time and place. 


Findings
 – Over 90 per cent of the sample indicated at least one traumatic event; 33.6 per cent indicated eight or more. Number of traumatic events did not impact on self-efficacy, resilience or coping strategy used. The type of coping strategy did not significantly impact on emotional reaction to intrusions across trauma groups. Participants with higher self-efficacy demonstrated greater problem-focused coping and less emotional reaction to intrusions. Participants with greater resilience scores utilised more problem and emotion-focused coping and experienced less emotional reaction to their intrusions. Resilience was predicted by self-efficacy and emotional reaction to intrusions. 


Practical implications
 – Professionals working with young offenders with trauma-related intrusions should focus on building strengths in the areas of problem-focused coping, self-efficacy and resilience. 


Originality/value
 – This paper adds to the literature on trauma in male young offenders by looking at psychological factors which could be developed upon to improve ability to manage intrusive thoughts.
