Due to the openness of communication network and the complexity of system structures, multi-agent systems are vulnerable to malicious network attacks, which can cause intense instability to these systems. This article provides a survey of state-of-the-art results of network attacks on multi-agent systems. Recent advances on three types of attacks, i.e., those on DoS attacks, spoofing attacks and Byzantine attacks, the three main network attacks, are reviewed. Their attack mechanisms are introduced, and the attack model and the resilient consensus control structure are discussed, respectively, in detail, in terms of the theoretical innovation, the critical limitations and the change of the application. Moreover, some of the existing results along this line are given in a tutorial-like fashion. In the end, some challenges and open issues are indicated to guide future development directions of the resilient consensus of multi-agent system under network attacks.
