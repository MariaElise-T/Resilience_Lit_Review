AbstractDoom Island is a small island in West Papua from a total of 4.110 small island which is located in the Sorong Archipelago District. This island is directly opposite the Pacific Ocean so it is very vulnerable to climate change induced hazards, including landslides, abrasion, tropical storm, heavy rainfall, water scarcity, and food security. Adaptation strategies especially for vulnerable communities such as baby, children under five years of age, children, pregnant or lactating mothers, persons with disabilities and the elderly is needed to increase their resilience to climate change and the other disasters. Socialization, training, and simulation are introduced to vulnerable communities and followed by in-depth interviews to find out adaptation strategies from local knowledge and harmonized with science.
