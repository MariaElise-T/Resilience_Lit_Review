Obesity discrimination, stigma, and biases toward the obese population have always been a toxic yet common phenomenon in contemporary society. The obese population, in many cases, is naturally held at a disadvantage, both stereotypically and social-structurally. Therefore, to seek possible solutions to reduce such toxicity and help the victims of obesity discrimination build up resilience, the researcher aimed to find behind such a phenomenon, psychologically and socially. Data and research results from previous studies are collected and intergraded to reference references in finding specific reasons for obesity discrimination. Meanwhile, another online survey is put out to collect the latest data regarding the same issues and also as a potential comparison. Lastly, the researcher interviews 50 adult victims of obesity discrimination to gain first-hand stories from the victimsâ€™ views regarding this social issue and therefore pursue a more comprehensive understanding of it. The research found that the primary reasons behind obesity discrimination are the overly enhanced endorsement of slender bodies from famous figures, which also coincides with the social identity theory.
