The increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters have attracted the attention of researchers in the power sector to enhance the resilience of power systems. Microgrids are considered as a potential solution to enhance the resilience of power systems using local resources, such as renewable energy sources, electric vehicles (EV), and energy storage systems. However, the deployment of an additional storage system for resilience can increase the investment cost. Therefore, in this study, the usage of existing EVs in microgrids is proposed as a solution to increase the resilience of microgrids with outages without the need for additional investment. In the case of contingencies, the proposed algorithm supplies energy to islanded microgrids from grid-connected microgrids by using mobile EVs. The process for the selection of EVs for supplying energy to islanded microgrids is carried out in three steps. Firstly, islanded and networked microgrids inform the central energy management system (CEMS) about the required and available energy stored in EVs, respectively. Secondly, CEMS determines the microgrids among networked microgrids to supply energy to the islanded microgrid. Finally, the selected microgrids determine the EVs for supplying energy to the islanded microgrid. Simulations have shown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in enhancing the resilience of microgrids even in the absence of power connection among microgrids.
