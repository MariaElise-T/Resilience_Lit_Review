 This article focuses on three works authored by Vandana Shiva and recently published by Zed Books. It employs these books as dialogical aids to map her thought in its political and ethical dimensions as they relate to peace, sustainability, and social justice. More specifically, after a brief introduction and a biographical discussion, this article situates her vision of Earth Democracy as a means to tie together Shiva’s inter-related reflections in the areas of agroecology, contemporary politics, and resilience. Comment is then offered concerning the tension and promises of Shiva’s treatment of these issues. The reader of this article is left with several points of entry to understand Shiva’s contributions to discourses on sustainable agriculture, nonviolent political change, and resilient sustainability.
