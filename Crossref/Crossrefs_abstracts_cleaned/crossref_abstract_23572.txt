Abstract
Pacitan is vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis because it is located near the subduction zone between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. So that it needs Disaster Risk Reduction efforts, one of the best measures is to implement the three pillars of Comprehensive School Safety. This study aims to analyze the implementation of the third pillar of Comprehensive School Safety, namely the Pillar of Risk Reduction and Resilience Education. The study was conducted at State Senior High School 1 of Pacitan and Islamic State Senior High School 1 of Pacitan because they directly face the Indian Ocean. This study used a quantitative approach with primary data obtained from filling out questionnaires by respondents. Respondents in this study were principals, teachers, and students involved in Scouting and Junior Red Cross in these two schools. The instrument was a questionnaire including teacher and education staff training, integration of disaster education into the curriculum, and extracurricular activities indicators. The results indicated that teacher and education staff and curriculum integration were not optimally carried out in these two schools. Furthermore, they have not yet established disaster mitigation extracurricular, but implementing disaster mitigation education was carried out through Scouts and Junior Red Cross.
