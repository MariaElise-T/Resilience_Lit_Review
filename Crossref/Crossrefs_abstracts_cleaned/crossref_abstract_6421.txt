 The resilient modulus of subgrade soil is used to design a pavement structure that is adequate for the expected traffic and environmental loading. Both mechanistic and empirical design procedures use this property. The resilient modulus test is a complex test that requires significant resources, including a high level of technical ability on the part of the operator. For smaller or less critical projects with a low volume of traffic where costly and complex resilient modulus testing is not justified, a correlation with other, simpler tests could be used. In this study, a correlation with the results of an unconfined compression (UC) test is explored for estimation of the resilient modulus of fine-grained soils. This paper presents several models with which to estimate the resilient modulus of fine-grained soil from the results of UC tests considering two sample preparation techniques: static and impact compaction. The simplest model considers only unconfined compressive strength to predict the resilient modulus with a fair correlation. The more detailed models also consider the plasticity index, percentage of material passing the Number 200 sieve, and modulus of the stressâ€“strain curve from the UC test. The sample preparation technique had a significant influence on the UC test results.
