Background: In the rapidly shifting Canadian climate, an ageing population, and increased migration, a greater understanding of how local climate and air pollution hazards impact older adults and immigrant populations will be necessary for mitigating and adapting to adverse health impacts. Objectives: To explore the reported health impacts of climate change and air pollution exposures in older adults and immigrant people living in Canada, identify known factors influencing risk and resilience in these populations and gaps in the literature. Methods: We searched for research focused on older adults and immigrants living in Canada, published from 2010 onward, where the primary exposures were related to climate or air pollution. We extracted data on setting, exposures, health outcomes, and other relevant contextual factors. Results and Discussion: We identified 52 eligible studies, most focused in Ontario and Quebec. Older people in Canada experience health risks due to climate and air pollution exposures. The extent of the risk depends on multiple factors. We found little information about the climate- and air pollution-related health impacts experienced by immigrant communities. Conclusions: Further research about climate- and air pollution-related exposures, health, and which factors promote or reduce resiliency in Canadaâ€™s older adults and immigrant communities is necessary.
