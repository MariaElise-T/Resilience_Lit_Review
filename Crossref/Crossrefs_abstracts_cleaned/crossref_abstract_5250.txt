Abstract
Resilient elements are widely applied for vibration and noise control in many areas of engineering. Their complex dynamic stiffness gives fundamental information to describe their dynamic performance and is required for predicting structure-borne sound and vibration using dynamic modelling. Many laboratory measurement methods have been developed to determine the dynamic properties of resilient elements. This paper presents a review of recent developments of the measurement methods from the perspective of force-displacement relations of the resilient element assembly rather than of their material properties. To provide context, the review begins with an introduction to modelling methods for resilient elements, especially for rubber and rubber-like isolators, and three standardized measurement methods are introduced. Recent developments are then discussed including methods to extend the frequency range, which are mainly developments of the indirect method. Mobility methods, modal-based methods, recent active frequency-based substructuring (FBS) and inverse substructuring (IS) methods to study the dynamic properties of resilient elements are also described. Laboratory test rigs and the corresponding identification methods are outlined. Methods to evaluate nonlinear dynamic properties of resilient elements by laboratory measurements are also discussed. Finally, the review is concluded by discussing advantages and limitations of the existing methods and giving suggestions for future research.
