The present study focused on validation of indigenous climate resilience practices in animal diseases and feed storage management based on 1,605 farmersâ€™ perceptions in eight districts in north-western Himalaya. The importance of the study in Himalayan regions was asserted by changed climate indicators like increased temperatures and receding rainfall in fragile and sensitive mountain ecosystem. The climate of surveyed districts varied from subhumid and sub-temperate climate having elevation 700â€“1300 amsl to sub-tropical climate having elevation up to 700 amsl. The use of drek plant (Melia azedarach) for skin diseases of animals; turmeric rhizome and taramira for deworming in young calves; mixture of lassi, gur, azwain and fern plant for bloat (Aphara); banana and jamun leaves for haemorrhagic disease in animals and extract of tobacco leaves for scabies diseases in sheep and goat were followed by 4â€“90% surveyed farm households in Kangra, Kullu, Una, Hamirpur and Mandi districts. Seed storage is an important factor as about 6% of losses exist due to non-availability of proper facilities in India. Seeds of crops were treated before sowing with a mixture of ash and cow dung by 15â€“77% farmers in seven districts except temperate regions of Lahaul and Spiti. Food grains were stored in a large spindle shaped basket made of bamboo (Perru) safe from pests and diseases by 10â€“86% farmers in Kangra, Hamirpur, Chamba and Mandi districts and higher perceptions were observed in majority of farmers in Kangra districts. Practices like use of match box sticks, dry leaves of Bangru (Mentha arvensis), Kali Basuti (Adhatoda sp.), Safeda (Eucalyptus citrodora) in wheat storage pests and use of walnut leaves (Juglans regia), pieces of resin rich wood (Jugnu) and wood ash for food grains storage were followed by 10â€“79% farmers in Kangra, Una, Hamirpur, Chamba and Mandi district. The study concluded that farmers of mountains possess Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITKs) and climate resilient practices for animal disease management and seed protection to mitigate the impact of climate change).
