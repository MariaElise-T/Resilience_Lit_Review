 Two studies were conducted to validate the so-called HEalthy and Resilient Organization (HERO) Model. Results from Study 1 provided validity and psychometric support for a new measure designed to assess HEROs composed by semistructured interviews with the CEOs of 14 companies as well as questionnaires for their stakeholders (710 employees, 84 work-units, their immediate supervisors, and 860 customers). In Study 2, SEM (using data aggregated at the work-unit level, which consisted of 303 teams and their supervisors from 43 companies) showed that healthy employees fully mediated the positive relationship between healthy organizational resources and practices, and healthy organizational outcomes (assessed by supervisors). Moreover, regression analyses (at the organizational level, with 2,098 customers) showed that employeesâ€™ excellent performance positively predicts customer loyalty and satisfaction with the company.
