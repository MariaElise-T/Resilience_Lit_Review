PurposeBuilding on the information processing perspective, the authors propose that both internal and external supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices play essential roles in mediating supply chain disruption orientation (SCDO) to exercise an influence on resilience. The authors also put forward analytics capability as an important moderator in the above-mediated relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected 170 match-paired questionnaires from Chinese firms to test our model. The authors further interviewed some managers to supplement key quantitative results.FindingsFirst, SCDO positively affects resilience via internal and external SCRM practices. Second, the mediating effects of internal and external SCRM practices are stronger when analytics capability is higher. Third, analytics capability positively moderates the positive effect of SCDO on SCRM practices. Meanwhile, it does not moderate the positive effect of SCRM practices on resilience.Research limitations/implicationsOur study contributes to SCRM-related and IT-related literature by considering the content, mediating mechanisms (i.e. internal and external SCRM practices) and boundary conditions (i.e. data analytic capability) of SCDO in shaping resilience in the digital supply chain.Practical implicationsOur study helps remind managers that firms build disruption orientation, develop different SCRM practices and leverage analytics capability to improve resilience amid unexpected and unplanned disruptions.Originality/valueOur study sheds light on the roles of both internal and external SCRM practices. Furthermore, this research helps explain how SCDO motivates resilience through SCRM practices, particularly for those firms that have higher analytics capability.
