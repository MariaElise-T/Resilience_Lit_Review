BACKGROUND: Current evidence of nonpharmacological intervention for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is lacking. AIMS: To examine whether an 8-week nurse-led cognitive-behavioral based group intervention would enhance resilient coping and life quality among community-based patients with TRD. METHOD: The participants were randomly sampled from a cohort of TRD recruited from two general teaching hospitals. The two groups were assessed with multiple outcome measures at baseline (T0); 8-week post-baseline (T1); and at 3, 6, and 9 months after T1 (T2–4). Psychoeducation was nested in the cognitive behavioral group intervention to facilitate discussion. RESULTS: Of the 23 participants (mean age 56 years, 69.6% female) in the experimental group, higher resilient coping and lower mental distress levels at T1 as well as later improved quality of life and community integration at T2–4 were observed compared to the controls across COVID-19 (T3). Overall, the scores of resilience and community integration were higher throughout the four follow-up points of observations for the experimental group. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that an 8-week nurse-led cognitive-behavioral based group intervention may enhance the TRD patients’ resilient coping and mental distress levels while providing the potentials for community reintegration after mental health psychoeducation engagement. It is imperative for the nurses caring for patients with TRD to extend from clinical-based intervention to community-based self-care approach, with the importance of short-term stress management and healthy lifestyle development highlighted during the community reintegration trajectory.
