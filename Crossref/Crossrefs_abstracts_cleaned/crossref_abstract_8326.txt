 Using a risk and resilience approach grounded in a multicultural feminist perspective, this qualitative study explores 10 urban adolescent mothersâ€™ experiences with multiple forms of violence, the relationships between violence and school, and their resilience, all within the context of welfare reforms. The findings suggest lives rife with simultaneous, often severe violence, the impacts of witnessing parental violence, linkages between family and partner violence, and cumulative violence exposure as a barrier to positive school outcomes. Several young women emerge as resilient, with five distinct factors conceptualized as contributing to resilience. In conclusion, the implications for welfare policies and programs are discussed.
