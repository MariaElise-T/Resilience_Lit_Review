Background and Purpose:Several methodological challenges are associated with measuring resilience in women. This study compares the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14) and the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) in a community sample of women.Methods:Data were collected from 120 women residing in low socioeconomic areas of Karachi, Pakistan. Construct validity, internal consistency, and responsiveness were calculated.Results:Both scales demonstrated satisfactory psychometric characteristics. The total RS-14 score was significantly associated with all subscales of the RSA. However, two items of the RS-14 did not show any association with any of the subscales of the RSA. Medium effect size was noted on the “structured style”subscale of the RSA.Conclusion:Differences between the scales concluded that the Urdu version the of RSA yielded improved results in this sample.
