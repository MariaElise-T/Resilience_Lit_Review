Background and Purpose:Adolescents in contexts of social vulnerability experience obstacles in the development of their resilience, which compromises the development of coping/response strategies to daily adversities. This study aimed to understand the resilience process of school adolescents in situations of social vulnerability in the light of Barker’s and Buchanan-Barker’s Tidal Model.Methods:This qualitative and exploratory study was carried out at a public school in the city of Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil. The sample was composed of 17 adolescents. Data collection was carried out through in-depth narrative interviews. The material was analyzed with the aid of the softwareInterface de R pour les Analyses Multidimensionnelles de Textes et de Questionnaires, interpreted through the assumptions of Tidal Model.Results:The dendrogram demonstrated the corpus delimited in five classes named as “Navigation Plan,” “Storms,” “Ocean of Experiences,” “Rescue,” and “Safe Harbor.”Conclusions and Implications for Practice:Through learning from narratives, nurses understand the important resources of a recovery journey and take care “with” adolescents, supporting the development of resilience to face storms by taking the helm of the vessel and resuming their travel.
