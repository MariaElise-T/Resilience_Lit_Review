Resilient micro-payment infrastructures are critical assets to digital economy as they help protecting transactions and promote micro shopping. In this paper, we present a micro-payment infrastructure based on blockchain technology that is capable of decreasing the complexity of transactions’ verification, reducing losses, and protecting against various cyber attacks. This infrastructure is user trust-aware, in the sense that it builds a trust function capable of providing real time management of the user’s trust levels based on historic activity and then adapts the level of verification and risk of user’s misconduct. Moreover, three different trust models are developed to provide different estimations of the tokens’ block size to be submitted to the blockchain network for verification and management of the user waiting time. The micropayment infrastructure provides different security services such as authentication, doublespending and double-selling prevention, tokens forging prevention, transaction traceability, and resilience to cyber-attack. In addition, its reactivity is improved through the reduction of the verification delay and user waiting time.
