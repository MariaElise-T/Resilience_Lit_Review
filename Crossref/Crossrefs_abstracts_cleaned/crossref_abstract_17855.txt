Purpose
This study aims to examine the levels of stress and resilience in a sample of British Indian parents bringing up a child with autism.


Design/methodology/approach
A total of 52 British Indian parents took part in a survey that included measures of stress, resilience, support and child adaptive functioning. Results were compared to a sample of white British (n = 120) and Indian parents (n = 120).


Findings
The British Indian parents recorded higher levels of stress and less perceived social support than their white British counterparts. British Indian parents took longer to register concern about their childâ€™s development and sought a diagnosis at a later age than the white British group. The delay in concern and diagnosis was similar to that found in the India group.


Originality/value
The research suggests that British Indian parents are disadvantaged in social support and mental well-being compared to white British parents and may face similar community pressures to parents bringing up a child in India.
