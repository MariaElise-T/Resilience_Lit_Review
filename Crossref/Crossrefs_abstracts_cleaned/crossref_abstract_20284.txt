AbstractIn this study five intermediate cities of Bangladesh as future populated urban centers have been investigated to formulate a comprehensive framework for climate resilient urban governance The conceptual framework adopted the modified structure of CRF model of S Tyler and M Moench (2012) incorporating Urban functional system, Local urban governance, and Climate resilience as major components. The cities have been conceptualized as a functional system to identify the climate change impact upon social, economic, environmental and political subsystems. The vulnerability assessment of climate change impact shows that the different level of risks caused by frequent climate hazards. The research initiates a resilience building process based on Mehtaâ€™s good governance (1998) through a shared learning dialogue (SLD) among stakeholders.
