The introduction of social media has changed the methods by which many individuals, communities, and organizations communicate and interact. The increasing popularity of social media within a business context has forced executives to rethink how they operate their businesses. Chae (2015) observed that the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been lagging in identifying the potential role and use of social media in both research and practice.  Recently, greater attention is being given to social media and its potential uses within the supply chain. This paper investigates the potential use for social media as a technology to help with supply chain risk detection and supply chain resilience.
