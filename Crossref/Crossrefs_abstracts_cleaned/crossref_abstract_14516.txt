X-ray tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that reveals the interior of an object from its projections at different angles. Under sparse-view and low-photon sampling, regularization priors are required to retrieve a high-fidelity reconstruction. Recently, deep learning has been used in X-ray tomography. The prior learned from training data replaces the general-purpose priors in iterative algorithms, achieving high-quality reconstructions with a neural network. Previous studies typically assume the noise statistics of test data are acquired a priori from training data, leaving the network susceptible to a change in the noise characteristics under practical imaging conditions. In this work, we propose a noise-resilient deep-reconstruction algorithm and apply it to integrated circuit tomography. By training the network with regularized reconstructions from a conventional algorithm, the learned prior shows strong noise resilience without the need for additional training with noisy examples, and allows us to obtain acceptable reconstructions with fewer photons in test data. The advantages of our framework may further enable low-photon tomographic imaging where long acquisition times limit the ability to acquire a large training set.
