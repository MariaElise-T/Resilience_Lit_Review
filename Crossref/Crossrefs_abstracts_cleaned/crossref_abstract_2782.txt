Modern societies are highly dependent on different critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). The growth of software (= cyber) layer, in size and percentage of the overall system is a future trend. Our society’s critical CPS — cyber, energy, water, transportation and communication — lacks of resilience, typically losing essential functionality following adverse events. This multiple case study research analyses five prior research projects from the safety and security field. The target of the paper is to research how resilience management of critical cyber-physical systems can be understood.
