Background.Some studies have begun to show benefits of brief in-person mind–body skills training. We evaluated the effects of 1-hour online elective mind–body skills training for health professionals on mindfulness, resilience, and empathy.Methods.Between May and November, 2014, we described enrollees for the most popular 1-hour modules in a new online mind–body skills training program; compared enrollees’ baseline stress and burnout to normative samples; and assessed acute changes in mindfulness, resilience, and empathy.Results.The 513 enrollees included dietitians, nurses, physicians, social workers, clinical trainees, and health researchers; about 1/4 were trainees. The most popular modules were the following: Introduction to Stress, Resilience, and the Relaxation Response (n = 261); Autogenic Training (n = 250); Guided Imagery and Hypnosis for Pain, Insomnia, and Changing Habits (n = 112); Introduction to Mindfulness (n = 112); and Mindfulness in Daily Life (n = 102). Initially, most enrollees met threshold criteria for burnout and reported moderate to high stress levels. Completing 1-hour modules was associated with significant acute improvements in stress ( P < .001), mindfulness ( P < .001), empathy ( P = .01), and resilience ( P < .01).Conclusion.Online mind–body skills training reaches diverse, stressed health professionals and is associated with acute improvements in stress, mindfulness, empathy, and resilience. Additional research is warranted to compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of different doses of online and in-person mind–body skills training for health professionals.
