AbstractMorocco, in North Africa, is a country vastly exposed to the whims of climate change, with frequent moisture and heat stresses occurring throughout the season. Hence, developing climate‐resilient, high‐yielding, and nutritious cultivars of durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. durum (Desf.)] is a major goal and challenge of Moroccan crop breeders. In that sense, the exploitation of crop wild relatives (CWRs) holds great potential to increase genetic diversity for critical adaptation traits. ‘Nachit’ (Reg. no. CV‐1202, PI 702365) is a CWR‐derived durum wheat cultivar released in 2018 for cultivation in Morocco by a joint effort of the National Institute of Agronomic Research, Morocco and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas. Nachit was released due to its good adaptation to the Moroccan dry conditions combined with high yield potential under irrigated conditions, extremely large grains, and richness in protein content. It also combines several traits for drought tolerance such as earliness and deep root system. Nachit was derived from a top cross between two elite lines and a wild emmer [T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides] collected in Syria. Hence, it provides a substantial example of exploitation of CWRs to achieve a superior cultivar adapted to the climatic stresses and responding to human needs.
