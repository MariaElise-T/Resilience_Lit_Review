This study explored the school and life experiences of four adults diagnosed with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) from an urban area in western Canada. Semi-structured interviews provided insight into the lives of these adults, including their experiences with this disorder as it related to their social interactions and peer relationships in elementary school, high school, and the community. Their educational and life experiences were examined with the goal of understanding how success is achieved among these individuals. Three major themes emerged from participant interviews: (a) “I don’t fit in”: negative school experiences leading to anger and frustration toward diagnosis; (b) intergenerational alcoholism, child abuse, and drug addiction; and (c) healing the wounds: sources of strength, success, and helping others. Despite the hardships these participants faced, they each found sources of strength and success that have allowed them to be resilient in the face of adversity.
