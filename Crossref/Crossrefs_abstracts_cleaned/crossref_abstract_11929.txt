Abstract
Living in a watershed (DAS) means getting ready for the risk of flooding. The choice of relocation is often taken by the government to reduce these risks. But the attachment of citizens to the surrounding environment makes relocation not the best choice. This study seeks to reveal how the Garda Caah community as citizens in the Citarum River Basin is able to decide and be responsible for their ideas, decisions and actions in the face of flooding. This study uses qualitative methods with a case study approach. The data collection techniques are carried out by interviews, focus group discussions and observations. The findings resulted resilience the communities around the Citarum watershed are realized by forming the Garda Caah Community, which in their work projects seeks to minimize the effects of flooding by sharing information about possible flooding. The Garda Caah community created a flood early warning system so that residents and local governments prepared to face flooding. Dissemination of information about floods is carried out through various media commonly used by the public, both traditional and modern channels.
