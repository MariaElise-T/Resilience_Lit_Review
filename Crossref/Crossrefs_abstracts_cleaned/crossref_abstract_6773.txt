The emerging concept of Industry 5.0 presents new challenges related to sustainability, resilience, and worker welfare in industrial companies; challenges that are vital for industrial and social development in the coming years. We believe that blockchain can help to face these challenges thanks to the trust and security it provides in complex ecosystems such as industrial supply chains. To verify this hypothesis, this paper performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based on two stages. A first stage focused on the analysis of publications related to blockchain and Industry 5.0. Being such a novel term and with limited literature, we complemented the analysis with a second stage in which we analyzed the benefits of blockchain on each of the three pillars of Industry 5.0: sustainability, resilience, and human-centricity. The results of the SLR confirm our initial hypothesis and provide details on how, and to what extent, blockchain can add value to each of the three challenges of Industry 5.0, empowering at least nine use cases that will contribute to those challenges.
