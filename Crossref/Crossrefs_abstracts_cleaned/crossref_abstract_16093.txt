PurposeResilience in lean production systems (LPSs) relies on both formal and informal practices. Considering that these latter are relatively less explored, this paper describes the nature and role of informal resilience practices in the performance of LPSs.Design/methodology/approachA survey was devised to assess the use of 12 informal practices related to resilience. The survey was answered by 206 respondents from high and low lean adopters in Brazil, focusing on their internal operations. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the impact of those practices on operational performance. Six respondents were approached on follow-up interviews, offering examples of informal resilience in LPSs.FindingsBoth high and low lean adopters used informal resilience practices to a similar extent, and they were not detrimental to high lean adopters. These practices had no moderating effect on the relationship between the level of leanness and the operational performance of high lean adopters.Research limitations/implicationsThis study did not capture how the contribution of informal resilience practices changed over time within the same company.Practical implicationsAs the informal resilience practices are not necessarily consonant with lean principles, their use and rationale should be made explicit to workers and managers in LPSs. Moreover, lean assessments might be more credible if paying heed to the informal ways of implementing lean practices.Originality/valueThis is the first study that investigates the role of informal resilience practices in LPSs.
