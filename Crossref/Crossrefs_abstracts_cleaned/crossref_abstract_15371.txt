AbstractAimsTo examine and refine a conceptual model of resilience in adult cancer care based on the perspectives and experiences of resilience in adults with colorectal cancer.DesignA descriptive qualitative study was performed.MethodsTwelve participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer that had completed cancer treatment with curative intent were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Australia from July to December 2019. The meaning of individual resilience was explored using in‐depth individual interviews. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Following data analysis, the elements of the conceptual model of resilience were mapped against the themes and subthemes to refine the model.ResultsFive themes were identified as key elements of individual resilience in adults with colorectal cancer: (1) seeking motivations to move forward; (2) striving for normality; (3) adapting and managing self; (4) drawing on external supports; (5) redefining self. A refined conceptual model of individual resilience in adults with colorectal cancer was developed based on the integration of the themes and the elements of the conceptual model of individual resilience.ConclusionsOur refined conceptual model of individual resilience in adults with colorectal cancer could facilitate nurses’ and other health professionals' understanding of the process of how resilient individuals with colorectal cancer overcome their illness‐related adversity. This refined model may be used to further develop and test cancer‐specific resilience measures and develop interventions to facilitate resilience in people living with colorectal cancer.ImpactThis research identified five features of resilience in adults with colorectal cancer and refined a conceptual model of resilience in adults with colorectal cancer. The findings could help nurses and other health professionals with identifying individuals who are at risk of adaptation difficulties and contribute to an early referral to psychosocial support services.
