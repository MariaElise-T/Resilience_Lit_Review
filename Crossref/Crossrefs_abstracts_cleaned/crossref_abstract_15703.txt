Earthquake resiliency of moment resisting frames, either new or existing ones, are important for maintaining community functionality. Improving earthquake resiliency needs a strong initiative in reducing earthquake risk. Steel pipe dampers can be used to increase earthquake resiliency. Steel pipe dampers, when installed at strategic locations in the moment frame structures, dissipate most of the earthquake energy in structures through inelastic deformation so that other components of the structure are protected. Steel pipe dampers control vibration in moment frame structures and are a disposable component in structures so that the damaged dampers can be replaced easily. Steel pipe dampers are cheap and require low workmanship, therefore the recovery time after disasters is short and the cost of recovery is low. Utilizing steel pipe dampers in passive energy dissipation systems help maintain community functionality during and after disasters. Lateral displacements were quantified and used as performance indicators. Significant drift and inter story drift reduction were achieved during a numerical study. All structural components, except the steel pipe dampers, remain elastic, indicating the effectiveness of the dampers in reducing the losses due to earthquakes.
