 Perfectionism is a topic relevant to veterinary medicine and has previously been found to be related to higher levels of stress and poorer mental health outcomes. However, many aspects of perfectionism have yet to be researched among veterinary students. This research investigates the relationship between perfectionism and the “Big Five” personality factors. Additionally, the relationship between resilience and neuroticism is addressed. This research includes a sample of 99 veterinary students enrolled at a College of Veterinary Medicine in the southeastern United States. Students completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Inventory (MPI), the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Results show that perfectionism is significantly correlated with personality factors; specifically, self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism are associated with neuroticism, socially prescribed perfectionism is associated with agreeableness, and self-oriented perfectionism is associated with conscientiousness. Neuroticism was found to have a significant negative correlation with resilience. Findings indicate that veterinary mental health professionals and educators should consider implementing specific strategies to help students develop a healthy balance in their perfectionistic beliefs and have targeted interventions to promote student resilience.
