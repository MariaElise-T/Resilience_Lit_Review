As a no-disturbance integrated-retrofitting technique, an external rocking frame was widely used on reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Yet, with the increasing demand for seismic strengthening of existing buildings, it has become a concern to evaluate the seismic strengthening schemes based on seismic resilience. Firstly, the dynamic equation of the structural system was derived, and the deformation control mechanism was revealed; thus, the corresponding design method was put forward for the rocking frame reinforcement. Secondly, after soft-first-floor structures were reinforced by rocking frames, the evaluation method of the reinforcement scheme was investigated based on seismic resilience. Finally, the feasibility of the assessment method was verified by a soft-first-floor frame structure, and a comparison was made between the method proposed in this paper and the conventional method. The results find that the soft-first-floor structure reinforced by the rocking frame increased by 10% in the inter-layer displacement and improved by 55.6% and 63.0% in the injury and mortality rates, compared to the buckling-restrained brace scheme. This indicates that the reinforcement scheme of soft layer structures with rocking frames is feasible and effective, and the reinforcement evaluation method proposed in this paper can quantitatively reflect the improvement in seismic performance.
