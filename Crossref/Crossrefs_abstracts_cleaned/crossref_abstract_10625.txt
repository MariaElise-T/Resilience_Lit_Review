The present study was designed to adapt a Resilience Scale, which examines the resilience level in adolescents of India’s Hindi speaking states. In the present study, 14 items from the Resilience Scale–R25, developed by Wagnild and Young (1993), were adapted in Hindi language in the Indian context. A total 1000 adolescent students from different Hindi speaking states of India responded to the R14 scale. To test the factorial structure of the R14, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were performed, and the internal consistency of the scale was studied. The results supported scale multidimensionality. The obtained Cronbach’s alpha revealed good internal consistency with a value of .78. Based on the psychometric properties, it is concluded that R14 is a reliable measure to assess the resilience of the adolescents of Hindi speaking states of India.
