This study reports on a case study using a systems thinking approach, system dynamics modeling tools, and communication strategies in dealing with a complex disaster management issue in Haiphong, a vulnerable coastal city in northern Vietnam. Desktop studies together with a number of interactive workshops were organized to provide inputs for developing a big picture of the current situation using Vensim software. Bayesian network modeling was then used to identify systemic interventions aiming at achieving the final goal of a disaster ready, resilient, and smart city. A number of communication strategies have been formulated and implemented. Initial evident successes of the interventions are discussed in this article.
