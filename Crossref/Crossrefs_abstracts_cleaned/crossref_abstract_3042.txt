Whether you have witnessed trauma or not during your placement, itâ€™s a subject that might come up either first hand or in conversation with those that you are looking after. Planning how to recover from trauma is difficult due to the nature of the unknown but there are some models we can follow to help us cope with and understand our response to what we have seen or heard. Developing your own resilience in the recovery of trauma will not only help you to bounce back stronger and with a greater sense of personal well-being but also allow you to support others who might have suffered trauma themselves.
