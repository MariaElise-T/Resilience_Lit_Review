The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected peopleâ€™s lives globally. Indonesia has been significantly affected by this disease. COVID-19 has also affected certain social and economic aspects of Indonesia, including community resilience. Through a variety of contexts and geographic locales, we explore the previously mentioned concept of resilience. From existing literature reviews, we develop a holistic framework for community resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, we formulate crucial factors for community resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: natural capital, social capital, human capital, stakeholder engagement, community participation, technology, and communication. Strategic stakeholder action in the community resilience domain has facilitated increases in economic as well financial capital for adapting to and surviving deficits in productivity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a reflection on and a comparative review of the existing literature from different countries.
