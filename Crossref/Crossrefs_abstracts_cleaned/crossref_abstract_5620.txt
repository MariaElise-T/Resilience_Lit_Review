Over the 1 year and 3 months, Ukrainian people, and especially Ukrainian medical community, keep resilience in this awful full-scale Russian invasion of our country. Due to our brave defenders, Ukrainian Armed Forces, we have the opportunity to live and work. Also during last months all regions of Ukraine experienced horrible missile attacks of Russian invaders.
