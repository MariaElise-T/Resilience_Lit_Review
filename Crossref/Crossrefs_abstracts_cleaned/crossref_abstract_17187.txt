Farming in India, despite numerous challenges, continues to play a pivotal role in feeding the nation's vast population. Recognizing the need for resilient agricultural practices to sustain the profession and secure the future of farming, explore the importance of adopting to change in the agricultural sector. The review highlights the current challenges faced by Indian agriculture, including climate change, diminishing natural resources, fragmented land holdings, lack of access to technology and information, and socio-economic disparities. These challenges pose significant threats to the sustainability and viability of farming, necessitating proactive measures to build resilience. To make farming stress-free and attractive for future generations, the review proposes various strategies and approaches that can enhance agricultural resilience. These include the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation agriculture, precision farming, and agroforestry, to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Additionally, the promotion of sustainable water management techniques, efficient irrigation systems, and watershed management can address the issue of diminishing water resources. Recognizing the role of policy frameworks in fostering agricultural resilience, the paper underscores the need for government support in the form of favourable policies, subsidies, and incentives.
