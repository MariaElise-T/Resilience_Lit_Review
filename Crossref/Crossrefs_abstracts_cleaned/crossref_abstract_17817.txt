Studies of cultural resilience concentrate on socio‐cultural processes that allow societies to resist the erosive strain of socio‐economic marginality and in response create social networks that provide cultural resilience. This study of a chronically poor, United States (U.S.) African‐American urban community in Champaign, Illinois, examines the community's adaptation to structurally generated socioeconomic marginality. This study finds that the theory of balanced, socioeconomic exchange relations helps to understand the intricate social dynamics of cultural resilience. The adaptive advantage of balanced exchange relationships are confirmed by an empirical analysis of personal social network data gathered female gang members.
