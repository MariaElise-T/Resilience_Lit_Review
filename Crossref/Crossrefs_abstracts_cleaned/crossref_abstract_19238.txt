Abstract
Resilience is more capable of dealing with hydro-meteorological disasters compared to the risk. Resilience is a positive concept that puts forward adaptation efforts so that more in line with sustainable development goals. This study aims to introduce the resilience concept in dealing with hydro-meteorological disasters and apply it at the provincial level in Indonesia. The methods used are: 1) measuring the climate risk index (CRI), 2) measuring the adaptation capacity index (ACI), and 3) classifying the provinces based on CRI and ACI. Grouping CRI and ACI are used to define provinces which have the potential to bounce back better (low CRI - high ACI), bounce back (high CRI – high ACI), recover but worse than before (low CRI -low ACI), and collapse (high CRI – low ACI). The study results indicate that throughout 2017 there are 10 provinces that South Sumatra, Central Java, and West Nusa Tenggara. In contrast, 3 provinces with the most have the potential to bounce back better, 7 provinces bounce back, 7 provinces recover but worse than before, and 10 provinces collapse. In general, 3 provinces with the lowest resilience are resilient levels are Riau, Bangka Belitung, and Riau Islands.
