AbstractThe purpose of this longitudinal study of 94 married entrepreneurs starting new businesses was to investigate protective mechanisms creating resiliency (capacity) in entrepreneurs and entrepreneur-assessed spousal commitment to new venture goals as a key element of the resilience process experienced within their couple decision context. Controlling for business demand, the effect on new venture sustainability as measured by breakeven point and business success was analyzed. Patterson’s FAAR theory, a family resilience theory, was applied because it clearly conceptualizes the components and influencing factors within the process of resilience and because the couple is the primary decision context of entrepreneurs. Spousal commitment (negative) and business demand (curvilinear) were significantly associated with breakeven point. Entrepreneur’s business confidence (positive), life outlook (positive), and business demand (curvilinear) were associated with business success.
