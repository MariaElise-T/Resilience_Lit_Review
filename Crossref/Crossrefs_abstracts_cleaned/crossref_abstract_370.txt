The human ecosystems embrace complex human-dominated systems, which often result in disparaging multifaceted social and ecological outcomes in various localities of the world. Green infrastructure (GI) with a well-planned and managed spatial organization and network of multifunctional landscapes does not only help improve the quality of life, but also promotes the multifunctional use of natural capital and enhances the resiliency of urban systems by enabling “disaster risk reduction”, or “DRR”, in real practice. To achieve more socially and ecologically resilient cities, the engagement of GI into the spatial network of the human ecosystem is inevitable. Moving on from this argument, the research utilizes several quantitative analysis tools, including space syntax methodology, graph theory, depth map analysis, linkage mapper analysis, and Arc-GIS to model the complex spatial patterns of the human ecosystem in the city center of Amman. To conclude, the study provides both theoretical evidence and practical assessment tools for the implementation of urban GI towards the sustenance of the social and ecological resiliency and NDRR within complex inner-city human ecosystems. The theoretical framework of this study embraces a novel contribution toward how resiliency and DRR theories can be merged into real practice through the utilization of a new methodological approach wherein the analysis, measurement, and visualization of human ecosystem spatial networks can be realized.
