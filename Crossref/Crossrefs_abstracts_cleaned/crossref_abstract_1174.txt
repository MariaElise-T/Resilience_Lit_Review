Objective: To examine the relationships be足tween resiliency, sociodemographic factors, and allostatic load among male Veterans.Design/Study Participants: Cross-sectional study with minority (African American or Hispanic) and non-minority (White) male Veterans undergoing prostate biopsy.Setting: Veterans Affairs Medical Center located in Charleston, SC.Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported resilience measured using the two item sub-scale from the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale and allostatic load determined from biomarkers measured in blood.Results: In this small sample, bounce-back resilience and allostatic load level had a significant negative correlation, while ad足aptation resilience and allostatic load were slightly correlated, but the association was not statistically significant. Sixty-six percent of participants reported that they were able to adapt and 40% reported they were able to bounce back. Higher income and lower PSA level were significantly correlated with greater adaptation resilience. Minor足ity men were significantly more likely than non-minority men to report that they are able to bounce back. Married men were also significantly more likely than unmar足ried men to report that they were able to bounce back.Conclusion: It may be important to target resiliency training programs to Veterans based on their social determinants and to examine the effects of these programs on allostatic load.Ethn Dis. 2020;30(Suppl 1):177-184; doi:10.18865/ed.30.S1.177
