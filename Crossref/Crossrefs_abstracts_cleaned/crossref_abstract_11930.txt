Achieving resiliency along the supply chain requires internal and external effort from all members of the chain. The purpose of this paper to identify key organisational factors to building resiliency in supply chain, and to understand how these factors can influence the development or enhancement of the supply chain resilience. To do so, a multiple case study was performed in different supply chains to validate organisational factors identified on the literature. As a result, ten organisational factors (five internal and four external) were highlighted and propositions were developed after the cross-case discussion to affirm the influence of them in building or enhancing supply chain resilience.Â DOI:10.12660/joscmv8n2p77-95URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv8n2p77-95
