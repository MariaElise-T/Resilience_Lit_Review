Objectives: This study aimed to identify the effects of self-esteem and stress coping styles on resilience in nursing students according to the Myers– Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).Methods: A descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected from 205 nursing senior students and analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Scheffé test, Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis.Results: In terms of self-esteem, social support-seeking stress coping style, and resilience, extroversion was significantly higher than introversion in MBTI preference. Among all factors, selfesteem had the greatest effect on resilience (r = 0.53), followed by the emotion-focused coping style (r = -0.31) and the problem-focused coping style (r = 0.23), with an explanation power of 57.1%.Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that self-esteem is an essential factor affecting resilience. Thus, nursing intervention programs for improvement of resilience in nursing students should be considered by the degree of self-esteem based on the MBTI personality preference.
