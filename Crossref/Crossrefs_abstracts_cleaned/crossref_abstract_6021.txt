The COVID-19 pandemic, adverse effects of climate change, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and other threats have been calling on all relevant stakeholders from varied disciplines to collaborate via the One Health approach, addressing the health of people, animals, plants, and their shared environment. This narrative review examines the need to add two more dimensions to the One Health approach: food systems and resilience, thus laying down the foundation of the Food System, One Health, and Resilience (FOR) approach. By doing so, all FOR approach elements would benefit from collaborative, multisectoral, transdisciplinary, planet-based, and system-focused efforts. Addressing more comprehensive determinants that positively impact resilience and sustainability would upgrade the One Health approach. We share some examples of academic institutions and innovation hubs that use this approach to improve access to adequate, safe, nutritious, and sustainable diets for all on our planet. We call on other FOR stakeholders, including governing institutions, to embrace the FOR approach and join the “FOR-runners”. It is suggested to widen the FOR community by including the doers, the food system’s workers, and consumers and to create the needed common grounds to drive for solutions rooted in equitable, just, locally tailored, inclusive, and sustainable solutions that withstand emergencies.
