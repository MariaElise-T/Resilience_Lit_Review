USAID coastal community assessment is used as main method in this research. There are eight elements of resilience for coastal community resilience: governance, society and economy, coastal resource management, land use and structural design, risk knowledge, warning and evacuation, emergency response and disaster recovery. The results show that overall rating for eight elements of community resilience is 2,5 or 50 %. It is only halfway to reach an ideal criterion for community resilience. Strong elements in this community are risk knowledge and warning and evacuation, while weak elements are society and economy, coastal resource management, and disaster recovery.
