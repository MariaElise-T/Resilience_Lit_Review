 This study applies a relationship perspective to study tourism crisis management and resilience. Despite the growing academic interest in crisis management, few studies have examined how tourism businesses utilise their networks as a crisis management strategy. This research uses a multi-case study design and longitudinal data collection to study the effects of a natural disaster on tourism businesses in Lombok, Indonesia. Results indicate that the characteristics and capabilities of individual tourism business actors and their networking behaviour affected the speed of their recovery. Networks can be used as a strategic tool and business recovery is improved by strengthening network resilience.
