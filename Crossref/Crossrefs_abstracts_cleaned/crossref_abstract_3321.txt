AbstractThis paper uses data from the survey of basic wellbeing indicators (2015) to investigate climate-related risk perceived impact on the household’s living standard in Togo. We investigate the data using a subjective approach with a Probit model and a Propensity Score Matching Method. For the majority of households in the sample, the results suggest, on the one hand, a significant impact of climate-related risk on their living standards. On the other hand, the estimation results show that income from activities increases the resilience and reduction of Togo households' climate-related effects. Finally, remittances increase the households' ability to be less climate vulnerable and play a significant role in the household’s resilience building. In terms of public policies, the results imply that a broader consultation and strategy are needed to reduce the consequences of climate related-risks on households in Togo.
