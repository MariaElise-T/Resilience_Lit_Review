"The aim of this paper is to identify the inner factors of women entrepreneurs during and after the economic turbulence to ensure their business sustainability. Hence, this paper highlighted the inner strength which are resilience (R), and internal locus of control (ILC) of women entrepreneurs during and after economic turbulence. Three hundred and ninety-eight of the 1,000 randomly distributed surveys to Peninsular Malaysian women business owners were returned. The reliability analysis shows that Cronbachâ€™s Alpha scores for all four inner factors were more than 0.70. Correlation analyses were performed to investigate the relationship of those factors. The findings indicate that there are significant and direct relationships between resilience and internal locus of control during and after economic turbulence."
