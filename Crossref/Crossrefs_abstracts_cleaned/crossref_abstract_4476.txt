Awe is a complex emotion often associated with experiencing multiple other positive emotions during a  captivating and immersive experience. Engaging in awe experiences contributes to enhancing an individual’s personal resilience and well- being. Moreover, the benefits of experiencing awe transcend the individual, as it has been described as a self-transcendent emotion provoking concern beyond the self. Using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology, this exploratory paper evaluates the impact of The Awe Project, an online resilience and well-being program that can be accessed on mobile devices, on a specific cohort of participants. Data analysis consisted of examining participant post-program surveys and comments made during the program. Results indicate the program supported participants’ resilience and well-being through evoking awe and using other mindfulness and resilience practices, such as having a sense of agency, cognitive reappraisal, connect ciation, meaning and purpose in life, and optimism and prospection.
