At present, the influence factors of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the relationship between PTG, self-perceived burden (SPB), and resilience are not completely clear. Thus, the present study examined whether resilience and SPB could predict PTG in CRC patients. The role of resilience as a potential mediator was also assessed. Using a cross-sectional design, a convenience sample of 157 CRC patients was selected as subjects, from July to December 2016 in a third-grade hospital. It was found that the main influencing factors for the total PTG score of CRC patients included work status, affordability for medical expenses, and duration of illness. Resilience was positively correlated with PTG, SPB was negatively correlated with PTG, and resilience played an intermediary role. Our findings remind clinicians to treat the psychosocial response of CRC patients from multiple perspectives, with a focus on their positive aspects. By increasing resilience and reducing the patient’s SPB, clinicians might enhance the patient’s PTG and quality of life.
