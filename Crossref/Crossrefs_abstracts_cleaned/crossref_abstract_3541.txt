AbstractThe human mouth harbors a complex microbiota, the composition of which is potentially influenced by a wide range of factors, including the intake of food and drink, the availability of endogenous nutrients, the host immune system, drug treatments, and systemic diseases. Despite these possible influences, the oral microbiota is remarkably resilient, particularly in comparison with the microbiota of the large intestine. Diet, with the exception of excessive and/or frequent consumption of fermentable carbohydrate or supplementation with nitrate, has minimal impact on the composition of the oral bacterial community. The common oral diseases dental caries and the periodontal diseases is associated with modification of the oral microbiota primarily as a result of the ecological changes induced by excessive acid production and inflammation, respectively. Systemically‚Äêadministered antimicrobials have only a small effect on the composition of the oral bacterial community, and while locally delivered antimicrobials can have some clinical benefits, the biofilm lifestyle of oral bacteria lends them substantial resistance to the agents used. Saliva plays an important role in oral microbial ecology, by supplying nutrients and providing protection against colonization by nonoral organisms. Dry mouth is one condition that has a major effect on the microbiota, resulting in increased colonization by opportunistic pathogens. Some systemic diseases do affect the oral microbiome, notably diabetes, in which raised levels of glucose in saliva and tissue impact on bacterial nutrition.
