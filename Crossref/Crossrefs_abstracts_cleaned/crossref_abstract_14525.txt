SummaryThis paper addresses the resilient robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of polytopic uncertain systems under the try‐once‐discard (TOD) protocol. At each transmission instant, only one sensor node obtains the privilege to access the shared communication network in order to prevent the data from collision. The measurements transmission order of the sensor nodes is orchestrated, and a switched system is constructed according to the underlying TOD protocol. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired resilient dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying TOD protocol is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the TOD protocol into account, sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the RMPC strategy and the stability of the established closed‐loop system in terms of the average dwell time method. Moreover, the effective resilient controllers in RMPC framework are derived by solving an online constrained optimization problem. Finally, a network‐based direct current motor example is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model predictive control strategy.
