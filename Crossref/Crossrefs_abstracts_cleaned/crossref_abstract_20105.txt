Abstract
Flooding is the inability of the channel capacity to accept stormwater so that it overflows into the surrounding area. The main problem of flooding in Jakarta is not in the main channel but in micro drainage which is commonly known as pluvial flooding. This research was conducted to increase resilience (reduce the risk of flooding) by making a device that is able to handle floods that can reduce the height and time of flooding in a location where flooding occurs. Floods cause damage. The parameters that are very important in determining the damage are inundation height and inundation duration. The methodology used in this research is to combine early warning system and emergency response based on hydrology engineering, hydraulics engineering and data science. The approach taken is to use an emergency response using the help of an early warning system. The emergency response used in this study is based on a mobile pump and its equipment and power that can be moved at any time. The emergency response is to use an early warning by predicting the microphysical symptoms of clouds that occur in the atmosphere. Emergency response is needed to cooperate together with early warning system in pluvial flooding problem. Unifying early warning system and emergency response system that this research called flood device is able to reduce the depth and duration of inundation.
