There are several uncertainties in the current global economic and political situation, which are compounded by natural catastrophes and other emergencies. Frequently, corporate supply chains have become more vulnerable and face enormous risks of supply disruptions, putting supply chain resilience to the test. Supply chain rigidity can result in huge losses for the organization if the supply chain is suspended. In this setting, the notion of supply chain resilience emerges at a critical juncture in history. With the development of environmental uncertainty, supply chain flexibility is becoming increasingly vital for the practical relevance of the organization. Big data, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have had a significant influence on supply chain management in recent years, thanks to the ongoing appearance of new technology. Big data analysis capability is one of them, and it has a particularly large influence on supply chain resilience management as one of the critical competencies that supply chain organizations should have.
