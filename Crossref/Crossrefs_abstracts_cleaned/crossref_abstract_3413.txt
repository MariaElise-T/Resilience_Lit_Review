Resilient channel is common within lightweight construction to improve the airborne and impact noise isolation of wall and floor-ceiling assemblies. The authors have previously presented results from systematic studies of resilient channels in wood stud wall assemblies (Internoise 2009;
 International Congress on Acoustics 2010) and wood-joist floor assemblies (International Congress on Sound and Vibration 2015) in which the effect of brand and model of resilient channel was compared in various assemblies. These studies documented the clear and significant acoustical performance
 differences between makes and models of channel that would have been considered equivalent before the release of this work. Additional comparative studies have been performed adding to the data previously presented. Acoustical performance is compared and conclusions about products are presented.
