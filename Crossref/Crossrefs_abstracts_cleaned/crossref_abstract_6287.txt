Abstract
Resilient modulus is a key mechanical parameter for unbound granular base materials. To evaluate gradation effects on the resilient modulus of crushed aggregate materials, the present study conducted laboratory resilient modulus tests on two categories of crushed aggregate materials with seven different gradations. A multi-factor sensitivity analysis was performed on test results and found that the confining pressure and axial stress yield a more significant impact on resilient modulus than the gradation. Different material gradations can yield an average impact of 8%, with a maximum of 21%, and show increased sensitivity with aggregate gradation becoming finer.
