The increase in teacher attrition has been substantial in U.S. public schools over the past three decades. The impact this trend has on student learning is pronounced, especially in high-poverty schools. Minimal research has focused on the resilient teachers who stay in these settings and the personal, professional, and biographical influences that guide that decision. This review of literature, guided by resilience theory, occupational socialization of physical education teachers, and research on poverty, attempts to demonstrate the importance of recruiting, training, and retaining resilient physical education teachers in high-poverty schools.
