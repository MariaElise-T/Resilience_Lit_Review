Background/Aim. In case of a disaster, it is necessary for the medical
   personnel to demonstrate the operational component of disaster resilience,
   which requires certain knowledge and skills regarding disaster medical
   response algorithms. The aim of this study was to analyze the preparedness
   of hospital medical professionals for maintaining hospital disaster
   resilience. Methods. In the period from July to September 2019, an anonymous
   survey was conducted among 295 hospital medical staff employed in hospitals
   in the territory of the region of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Pearson's chi-square
   test, Student's t-test and graphical analysis were used in the statistical
   analysis. Results. of the survey show that most of medical staff (85.8%)
   believed that disaster drills are not held regularly in hospitals, the
   training period was less than 2 years (30.8%), and that the majority (86.1%)
   did not participate in exercises. Conclusion. The level of preparedness for
   responding to disasters is not maintained at a high level in hospitals in
   the territory of the Plovdiv region due to the irregular implementation of
   exercises and the small number of participants in them. So, it is necessary
   to introduce a specific training program and exercise once a year, which
   should have a beneficial effect on increasing the better preparedness of the
   medical staff for disasters and improving the operational resilience of the
   hospital.
