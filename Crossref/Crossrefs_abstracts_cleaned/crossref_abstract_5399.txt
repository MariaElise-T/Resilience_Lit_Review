Human society has been dealing with natural threats since the very beginning of humanity. A society that is better prepared for disasters can better resist the adverse effects of disasters and subsequently adapt to them and thus be prepared in the future for known threats and “new” ones. Level of education, access to information, the income of communities, or social capital are just some factors that can determine the level of safety and preparedness of members of society, especially the vulnerable. For this reason, frameworks and strategies containing disaster risk reduction tools aimed at developing and increasing the level of safety, prevention and preparedness of all states (including island states) for disasters have been created. The article aims to identify vulnerable community members and evaluate the factors that can cause gender inequality in disaster risk reduction and can also significantly influence the increase/decrease of community resilience to disasters. Furthermore, the article presents practical examples from different countries that point to the importance of addressing disaster risk reduction, including global and governmental responses to disasters and the impact of these responses on society.
