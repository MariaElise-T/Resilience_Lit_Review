Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are essential assets used to maintain vital societal functions, for example utilities such as power, water, gas, and telecommunication networks. CIs comprise two main parts, namely a: Cyber component and a Physical component, which allow them to operate. Therefore, the occurrence of faults or attacks in either domain can result in the disruption of services, causing negative impacts beyond the system itself. The purpose of this article is to raise awareness within Trinidad and Tobago and, by extension, the Caribbean on the importance of maintaining resilient and cyber secure CIs for the purpose of critical infrastructure protection (CIP) given the current situation. A review of past incidents from 2012 - 2022 taken place both regionally and internationally is discussed, with major emphasis on those occurring in the Caribbean region. These incidents have been presented from the perspective of faults and cyber-attacks affecting CIs resulting in the disruption of services. In responding to frequently occurring scenarios, recommendations on the way forward have been proposed.
