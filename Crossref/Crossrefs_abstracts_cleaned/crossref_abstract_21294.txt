PurposeThis study investigated the mediating role of resilience in the association between moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychological ill‐being, as well as the moderating role of age in the direct and indirect relationship between MVPA and psychological ill‐being in children with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).MethodsEighty‐five children aged 6–12 years (Mage = 8.41 ± 1.44 years) diagnosed with ADHD were recruited. Participants wore an accelerometer on their non‐dominant wrist for seven consecutive days to record MVPA. Resilience and psychological ill‐being were assessed using self‐reported questionnaires.ResultsMVPA was positively associated with resilience but negatively related to depression and stress. Resilience was negatively correlated with depression and stress. Using the bootstrapping method, the indirect effect of resilience was found between MVPA and depression (−0.006%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [−0.060, −0.020]) in children with ADHD, supporting partial mediation. Moderated mediation analysis further demonstrated that the indirect effect of MVPA on depression via resilience was stronger in older children (−0.008, 95% CI = [−0.023, −0.001]) than in younger children with ADHD.ConclusionThe findings may inform future empirical studies on designing exercise interventions with MVPA levels that help to improve resilience and depression in children with ADHD.
