Problem Epidemiological data throughout the academic world show an upswing in mental health concerns among students, even more significant during the ongoing COVID-pandemic. Many universities have recognized these problems and started counseling programs. However, currently reported stress levels and mental health problems at many universities remain substantial. Approach Our medical faculty features an evidence informed longitudinal program on personal-professional development (LPPD) integrated into the core curriculum to strengthen wellbeing and support the student as a whole. Outcomes With our LPPD program we show that it is possible to successfully enable personal-professional development and well-being, especially in unexpected times when resilience is needed. The safe learning environment the teacher-coaches created has proven to be an important condition in this regard. Next steps The LPPD program will be further evaluated and both results and program materials will be shared with the academic community through web-pages, online material and research papers.
