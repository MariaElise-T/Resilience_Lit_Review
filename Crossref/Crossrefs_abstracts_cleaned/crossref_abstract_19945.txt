Objective: ADHD is a disorder associated with impairment and comorbid psychiatric problems in young adulthood; therefore, factors that may imply a more favorable outcome among adolescents with ADHD are of interest. Method: This study used a longitudinal design to assess whether adolescent personal resilience characteristics during adolescence protected against psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety 3 years later. Self-reported protective factors were used as baseline measures in the assessment of 190 clinically referred adolescents with ADHD. A semi-structured diagnostic interview was performed at the follow-up. Results: In a group of youth with ADHD, personal resilience characteristics were associated with better psychosocial functioning in young adulthood, and less depression and anxiety. Conclusion: Although further research is needed, these results indicate that personal resilience characteristics may be protective factors in the transitional period from adolescence to early adulthood.
