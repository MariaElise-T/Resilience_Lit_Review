Abstract: Urban regions with rapidly expanding populations are particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. The chain continues where climate change is a major contributor to many catastrophic disasters. Natural catastrophes and calamities always have a terrible effect on human settlements and have an economic and social impact on civilizations by destroying infrastructure and building stock. To solve the problems, risk management and risk minimization are essential. The sole strategy to increase a building, facility, or community's ability to both prevent harm and recover from damage is resilience. The notion of the paper is to examine resilient approaches, trends and tactics that take the improvement of communities and other settlements into account. These findings may also have some policy ramifications, such as the need for better regulation of local construction, initiatives to boost the local economy, and increased public knowledge of disaster risks and preparedness.
