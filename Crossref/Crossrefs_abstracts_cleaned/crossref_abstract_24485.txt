An innovative safety administration paradigm, resilience engineering (RSE), is becoming more popular in today's sociotechnical organizations. It is thought that the properties of complicated social and technical structures better align with RSE. Especially when it comes to measuring and modeling, RSE is much more difficult due to its various criteria character and the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative latent components. Using the extant neutrosophic TODIM (Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) approach, this study seeks to create a neutrosophic mixed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for assessing and evaluating resilience. Several indicators of resilience were defined as part of the first assessment methodology. After that, the neutrosophic TODIM technique was used to assign relative importance to the various resilience indicators and to rate the effectiveness of the various operational units. As an illustration of the model's efficacy, we conducted a risk assessment of a gas refinery, a prototypical sociotechnical structure.
