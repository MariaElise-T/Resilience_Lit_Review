AbstractAimThis study aimed to examine the relationship between social support and quality of life in urostomy patients and identify the mediating role of resilience in that relationship.DesignA cross‐sectional design.MethodsParticipants included 232 patients who were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Beijing during March 2020 and August 2020. They completed questionnaires about perceived social support, resilience and ostomy‐related quality of life. Structural equation modelling was performed to analyse the data.ResultsThe mean age of patients was 65.79 (SD = 8.67) years, and the mean length of time after surgery was 42.14 (SD = 15.76) months. Urostomy patients' quality of life, social support and resilience were all above moderate. Social support had a positive direct effect on the quality of life and a positive indirect effect on the quality of life through the mediating role of resilience.
