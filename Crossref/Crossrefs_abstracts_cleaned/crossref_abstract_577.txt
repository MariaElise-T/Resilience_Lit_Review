Background: Critical infrastructure resilience and sustainability are key components of both the 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, as well as the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (Panda & Ramos, 2020). The recent passing of the 2021 Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill in Australia, coupled with the lack of a governing document at the state level in Tasmania, necessitates a review to uncover the governance settings, which will aide in increasing the resilience and sustainability of energy infrastructures in Tasmania.
Methods/Design: Following the 2015 PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), the review will focus on scholarly sources that address the governance of energy infrastructures. An initial deductive data extraction template has been created to help structure data extraction from included studies. In addition to governance settings, secondary evidence will be sought regarding interruptions to energy infrastructures; policy problems and solutions; and resilience and sustainability definitions. Should other themes emerge, the data extraction template will be updated.
Discussion: Findings from this review will contribute to a more complete understanding of how the resilience and sustainability of energy infrastructures may be increased via deeper knowledge of their governance settings. Tasmanian policy-makers, practitioners, industry specialists, and researchers may use this research to inform and enhance their decision-making on this important topic.
