The survey was conducted from April 19, 2021 to April 21, 2021 using a paper questionnaire including relationship change scale, satisfaction in major, resilience, and student adaptation to college Questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS WIN 28.0 Program, independent t-test, ANOVA, Scheffe's test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and hierarchical regression analysis. Student adaptation to college is positively correlated with resilience (r=.70, p<<.001), satisfaction in major (r=.58, p<.001), interpersonal relationship (r=.51, p<<.001). Hierarchical regression analysis showed that satisfaction in major (β=.27, p<.001) and resilience(β=.54, p<<.001) were significant predictors of student adaptation to college.
