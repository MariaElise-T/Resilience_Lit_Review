The purpose of study is a descriptive investigation study to identify the impact of empathy, resilience, and person-centered nursing
on integrated nurse care service (INCS) unit nurses’ self-recognized nursing service quality. The subjects was analyzed using frequency,
percentage, mean, standard deviation, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Pearson correlation, and Hierarchical regression regression
analysis with the SPSS/WIN 28.0 program. There were significant relationships between nursing service quality and empathy (r=.54, p<.001),
resilience (r=.59, p<.001), person-centered nursing (r=.61, p<.001). Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the factors influencing nursing
service quality were person-centered nursing (β=.53, p<.001) and resilience (β=.27 p<.001) in this study. In order to increase the nursing
service quality of nurses working in integrated nurse care service (INCS) units, person-centered nursing and resilience have been identified
as significant factors. Therefore, it is necessary to educate nurses on competency development so that nurses working in integrated nurse
care service (INCS) units can perform person-centered nursing. In addition, a program to improve the ability to cope with stress and crisis
situations should be prepared for nurses working in integrated nurse care service (INCS) units.
