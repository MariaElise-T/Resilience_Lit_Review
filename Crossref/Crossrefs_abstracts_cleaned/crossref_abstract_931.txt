Sepakung Village is also known as the digital village because of the installation of wireless internet connection facilities in 12 districts around the village. The difficulty of obtaining information in the industry 4.0 era has allowed village officials to create unlimited access opportunities for rural communities as part of the digital benefits and simplify the administrative procedures for residents currently outside the village. This research aims to measure the level of cyber resilience of digital villages, and to find a model of cyber resilience for the development of digital villages in Indonesia based on laws and policies, economy, society and culture, politics and technology. This study is based on the survey data collection method, using questionnaire surveys, and closed-end statements based on the supplementary survey data filling method, using the Likert scale (interval) as the measurement mode of the respondent's answer. The number of participants was 11, most of them were between 15-20 years old. This study shows that most of the interviewees have sufficient understanding, insight and response measures to the threats facing the digital world, but lack collective improvement activities. Cooperation among village stakeholders (including officials, communities, scholars and governments) is needed to realize a digital village community with comprehensive and sustainable network resilience in a borderless global community.
