 This study aimed to develop a Chinese Mental Resilience Scale. A total of 2500 healthy participants, in two representative samples of the Chinese population, were administered the scale. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analysis were used to obtain the relevant coefficients and verify the reliability and validity of the scale. Five factors were extracted: willpower, family support, optimism and self-confidence, problem solving, and interpersonal interaction, plus a lying subscale, which together accounted for 54â€‰percent of the total variance. The Chinese Mental Resilience Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties. It can be used to evaluate the mental resilience level of general Chinese population.
