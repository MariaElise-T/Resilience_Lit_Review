 Grounded in communicated narrative sense-making (CNSM) and resilience theorizing, the current study investigated the effects of mother-daughter communication on young adult women’s ( n = 60) narrative construction of resilience over time. Participants wrote stories of difficult experiences at Time 1, discussed the story with their mother in a research lab two days later, and wrote the story again at Time 2. Inductive analyses of daughters’ stories revealed four themes of resilience: acknowledging the struggle, taking action, seeking silver lining, and finding strength in others. Mother-daughter interactions were analyzed for CNSM behaviors—engagement, turn-taking, perspective-taking, and coherence. Mother-daughter coherence and engagement illuminated differences in daughters’ themes of resilience, and all CNSM behaviors positively related to daughters’ increased narrative resilience over time. Findings demonstrated the effect of mother-daughter interaction on young adult women’s resilience, suggesting that CNSM contributes to the meaning-making component of resilience. Implications for advancing CNSM and resilience theorizing are explored.
