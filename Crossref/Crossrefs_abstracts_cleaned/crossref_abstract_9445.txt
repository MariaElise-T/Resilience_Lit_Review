The resilience of mattress foam has influenced on body pressure distribution characteristic of mattress and human comfort. This paper dealt with resilience of foam and body pressure distribution through resilience test instrument for mattress foam and body pressure distribution system. The results showed that the resilience of latex foam was better and the body pressure distribution of mattress with latex foam layer was better. This study results have important reference value to the flexibility of mattress and comfort design.
