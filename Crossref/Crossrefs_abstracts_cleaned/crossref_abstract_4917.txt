AbstractUsing a quasi‐experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of a standardized intervention model designed to build resiliency in children of women with co‐occurring mental health and substance use disorders and histories of interpersonal abuse. The children and mothers who participated in this study were a subset of the sample used for the Women, Co‐occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS). The children's intervention model consisted of three components: clinical assessment, service coordination and advocacy, and a psychoeducational skills‐building group. Children in the comparison group received individual, group, and family services. Six‐month and 12‐month outcomes were examined among 253 children. Children in the intervention group improved significantly more than children in the comparison group. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comm Psychol 35: 823–843, 2007.
