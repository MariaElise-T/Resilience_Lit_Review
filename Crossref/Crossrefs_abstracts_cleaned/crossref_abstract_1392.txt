Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to operationalize the construct of work interruptions resiliency (WIR) and develop a measure assessing the extent to which employees report resiliency in resumption of work activities post-interruption (Study 1), and to further examine WIR’s nomological net, specifically its predictive relations with important employee-level outcomes (Study 2).


Design/methodology/approach
Study 1 utilized subject matter experts and data from 274 employees from a range of industries for scale development. Study 2 utilized 365 registered nurses from a hospital network to confirm and extend the findings from Study 1 within a relevant, dynamic job type.


Findings
Study 1 yielded a psychometrically sound measure for WIR comprised of four factors (typical, critical, external, sensory). Validity was evidenced via negative correlations with cognitive demand and Type A personality, and positive correlations with conscientiousness. Study 2 expanded WIR’s nomological net by evidencing its predictive relations with employees’ role clarity, autonomy support, role breadth self-efficacy, and evidence-based practice adoption intentions.


Research limitations/implications
This research introduces WIR and develops a measure for assessment, providing validity evidence and establishing an initial nomological net for WIR upon which further research can rely and build.


Practical implications
The work interruptions resiliency construct and measure have the potential to impact selection and training, particularly in job types wherein poor recovery from interruptions can yield detrimental consequences.


Originality/value
Work interruptions compromise productivity and result in errors. It is therefore crucial that organizations assess the extent to which employees are resistant to the detrimental effects of such disruptions (Study 1) and understand the nature of WIR’s predictive relations with important employee-level outcomes (Study 2).
