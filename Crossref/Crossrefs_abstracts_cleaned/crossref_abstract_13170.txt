AbstractThis paper presents a wideband blocker-tolerant direct $$\varDelta \varSigma$$ΔΣ receiver (DDSR). Blockers are attenuated through selective input impedance matching and reduced gain design. The selective input impedance profile provides a low impedance at blocker frequencies enabling blocker attenuation, while the in-band impedance is boosted to matched condition through an up-converted positive feedback from the DDSR output. In addition, with the help of reduced gain design, near band blocker gain is minimized, further improving the blocker resilience. The receiver is designed for configurable operation from 0.7–2.7 GHz and a baseband bandwidth of 10 MHz. Simulated in a 28 nm technology, the DDSR demonstrates a maximum noise figure of 6.2 dB, and achieves a peak SNDR of 53 dB with an out-of-band 1 dB input compression point of $$-\,11$$-11 dBm at a 100 MHz offset.
