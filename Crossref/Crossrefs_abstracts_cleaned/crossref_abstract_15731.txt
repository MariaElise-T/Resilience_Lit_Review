Technical sectors compose an inseparable and elementary part of a complex critical infrastructure (CI) system. Their provided services are essential to the functioning of all of the dependent sectors of CI on which society and states depend, especially in areas experiencing high levels of urbanisation. The initial point for effective CI elements’ protection is the permanent assessment and strengthening of their capacity for resilience to the negative effects of internal and external threats. The current perceptions of resilience focus primarily on repressive components responsive to incidents (i.e., robustness, recoverability, and adaptability), while minimal attention is paid to the preventative components. The article’s contribution to this literature gap is its definition of resistance, which can be considered as a CI element’s ability to prevent the occurrence of incidents. To this goal, the current study defines (1) the individual factors (variables and parameters) determining CI resistance and (2) the methodological procedure for infrastructure element resistance assessment in order to identify the weak points throughout a complex CI system and subsequently strengthen them. Moreover, a practical example of resistance assessment for a selected critical energy infrastructure element is presented. The main outcome of this article is the definition of the primary steps for the expansion of the CIERA method, via the enhancement of CI components’ resilience capacity in the prevention phase.
