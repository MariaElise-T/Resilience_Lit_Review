AbstractAimThis paper is a report of an analysis of the concept resilient ageing. Unique in comparison with other healthy ageing concepts, resilient ageing can be applied to all older people, regardless of age or affliction.BackgroundThe state of global population expansion in older people over the next 50 years calls for increased health promotion research efforts to ensure the maintenance of health and optimal quality of life for all older people.Data sourcesLiterature for this concept analysis was retrieved from several databases, CINAHL, PubMed PsycINFO, for the years 1990–2012.DesignRodgers's evolutionary method of concept analysis was used because of its applicability to concepts that are still evolving.MethodsAn integrative research review methodology was applied to peer‐reviewed journal articles (n = 46) for an inductive analysis of the concept of resilient ageing.ResultsThe antecedents, defining attributes, and consequence of resilient ageing were identified. Antecedents to resilient ageing were found to be adversity and protective factors, while the core attributes include coping, hardiness and self‐concept. The consequence of the process of resilient ageing was optimal quality of life. Sense of coherence was found to be the surrogate term. The results obtained were further substantiated using Antonovsky's (1979) theory of salutogenesis.ConclusionA theoretical definition and a model of resilient ageing were developed. In addition, a discussion was provided on the practice, policy and research implications for promoting the development of protective factors and resilient ageing.
