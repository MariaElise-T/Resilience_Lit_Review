In recent years, tourism industry has become a very important sector within the national economy and for this reason, the tourism industry in Romania is considered to have an important role in achieving the objectives defined by the European Commission through the Agenda 2020. The resilience of Romanian tourism to economic crises is characterized by the involvement of all social and age categories in tourist activities, the tourist promotion of Romanian destinations in international circuits, the complexity of the forms of tourism within the destinations in Romania, the expansion of forms of tourism in disadvantaged areas, etc. During the economic crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, tourism represented a means of growth, development and capitalization of rural spaces for the locals because, during the restrictions imposed by the authorities, the majority of tourists chose tourist stays in rural areas due to the calm, peaceful and wonderful scenery with a lot of experiences as horse riding, climbing, hiking, etc. The geographical location of Romania underlines a variety of natural components and landscapes, which outline partly the country's tourist potential: the Romanian Carpathians, the Danube River, the Black Sea with its coastline, the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, the Danube Gorge, flora and fauna of Romania and the man-made landmarks (monasteries, churches, etc.).
