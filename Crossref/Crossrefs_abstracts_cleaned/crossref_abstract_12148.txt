A better feeling of meaning and purpose, as well as advancements in crucial personal and professional skills, are all results of spiritual intelligence. The purpose of the current study was to look at the relationships between perceived stress, resilience, and spiritual intelligence. The total sample of the current study was comprised of 200 Peshawar university students (N=200). One hundred (n=100) were males, and one hundred (n=100) were females. The sample was approached from various universities of Peshawar. For the collection of data a research tool, the spiritual intelligence self-report inventory (SISRI) along with Brief resilience scale (BRS) and Perceived stress scale (PSS) were administered both individually and in groups. The study's findings clearly illustrated a moderately negative link between spiritual intelligence and perceived stress (=-.426**) and a moderately positive correlation between spiritual intelligence and resilience (=.163*). While with respect to male and female differences in spiritual intelligence (t=1.20, p=.231) and perceived stress (t=1.55, p=.122) have been obtained. The linear regression analysis shows that spiritual intelligence predicts statistically significant at p.05 with a variance R2 of.181 and an adjusted R2 of.177, and it also predicts resilience at .05 with a variance R2 of.26 and an adjusted R2 of 0.22. Similarly, results show that perceived stress and resilience are predicted by spiritual intelligence. In light of the findings, it is inferred that spiritual intelligence and resilience are positively correlated, while perceived stress and spiritual intelligence are negatively correlated. Spiritual IQ and perceived stress did not show any conclusive gender differences. However, students' perceptions of stress and spiritual IQ were slightly higher for female students.
