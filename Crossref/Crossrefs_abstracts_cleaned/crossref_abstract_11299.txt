Date Presented 04/05/19
Emotional intelligence, attachment style, and resilience were found to work together to predict time perception, which literature has shown to predict academic achievement in doctoral students. OT academicians can use these results to enhance admission criteria by screening for emotional intelligence, attachment style, and resilience and help at-risk students in online distance doctoral programs strengthen these predictors.
