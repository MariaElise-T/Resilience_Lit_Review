This paper delves into the intricate relationship between climate change, extreme weather events, urbanization, and its multifaceted impacts on business and society. It charts the historical trajectory from the Industrial Revolution to contemporary urbanization, revealing the critical role of human activity in driving climate change. The changing interplay between urbanization, industrialization, economic growth, and environmental consequences. Through an interdisciplinary lens, this paper reveals the intricate links between climate change, extreme weather events, and urbanization. The escalating frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, from heatwaves to floods, have ripple effects on economies and communities across the globe. In the midst of these climate challenges, the concept of resilience as a guiding framework has taken center stage in the discussion. Once a psychological construct, resilience has evolved into a multidisciplinary approach to climate risk. This paper explores the collaborative efforts of government, business, and civil society in developing adaptive strategies that enhance climate resilience. It emphasizes the crucial role of business in building climate-resilient supply chains, supporting communities, and promoting environmental sustainability. The need for collective action is emphasized, urging stakeholders to work together to address the complex challenges of climate change. By understanding these interconnections, societies can use adaptive strategies to navigate the changing climate landscape and advance toward a future of shared prosperity, environmental sustainability, and resilience in uncertainty.
