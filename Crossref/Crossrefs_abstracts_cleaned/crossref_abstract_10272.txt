A needy family is the underprivileged group in the society, in which children and youths growing in a needy family are the most underprivileged group, who have no choice and could not overcome it by themselves. Effects of poverty on children contain malnutrition or disorder, more chronic diseases, higher epidemic disease infection rate, high accident rate, low study preparation, low learning achievement, high social emotion and behavior problems, high risk of domestic violence, and bad parent-child relationship. Discussions about poverty are often related to social exclusion. Some people regard social exclusion as the division of poor people; social exclusion is not simply a result, but a dynamic process; social exclusion is not the result of inequality, but the behavior to separate people and group due to systems.
