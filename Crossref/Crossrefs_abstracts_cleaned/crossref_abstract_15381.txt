The world's coral reefs are under unparalleled pressure due to climate change, stimulating research focused on preventing further damage and loss in these ecosystems. The coral microbiome has been widely acknowledged as crucial to coral health and function, playing multiple roles in key biological processes. Recent empirical studies suggest that microbes may contribute to coral host tolerance of thermal stress, and harnessing these benefits through microbiome engineering (ME) may provide a mechanism for enhancing climate resilience in corals. Although coral ME is in its infancy, similar and successful ME approaches that are already underway in other fields – including agriculture, medicine, and wastewater treatment – may serve to guide and improve ME techniques in corals. We discuss current applications of ME, identify three key research priorities that will help elucidate the viability of ME for corals, and consider the implications of using these approaches for reef restoration.
