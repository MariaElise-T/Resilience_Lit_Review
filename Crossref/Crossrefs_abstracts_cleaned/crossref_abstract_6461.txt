The selection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) resilient sows has been proposed as a strategy to control this disease. A discrete event-based simulation model was developed to mimic the outcome of farms with resilient or susceptible sows suffering recurrent PRRSV outbreaks. Records of both phenotypes were registered in a PRRSV-positive farm of 1500 sows during three years. The information was split in the whole period of observation to include a PRRSV outbreak that lasted 24 weeks (endemic/epidemic or En/Ep) or only the endemic phase (En). Twenty simulations were modeled for each farm: Resilient/En, Resilient/En_Ep, Susceptible/En, and Susceptible/En_Ep during twelve years and analyzed for the productive performance and economic outcome, using reference values. The reproductive parameters were generally better for resilient than for susceptible sows in the PRRSV En/Ep scenario, and the contrary was observed in the endemic case. The piglet production cost was always lower for resilient than for susceptible sows but showed only significant differences in the PRRSV En/Ep scenario. Finally, the annual gross margin by sow is significantly better for resilient than for susceptible sows for the PRRSV endemic (12%) and endemic/epidemic scenarios (17%). Thus, the selection of PRRSV resilient sows is a profitable approach for producers to improve disease control.
