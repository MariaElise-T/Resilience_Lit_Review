AbstractKalisch and colleagues present a conceptual framework for the study of resilience, using a neurobiological approach. The present commentary examines issues arising for the study of resilience from epidemiological data, which suggest that resilience is most likely a normative function that may operate as a kind of psychological immune system. The implications of the epidemiological data on the development of a neurobiological theory of resilience are discussed.
