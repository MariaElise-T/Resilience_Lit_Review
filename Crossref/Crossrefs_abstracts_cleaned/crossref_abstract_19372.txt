Abstract. Informal caregivers of people living with dementia (PwD) are at increased risk for the development of stress-related physical and mental illness. Nevertheless, because of differing resilience, they show interindividual differences in their ability to cope. Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the associated pandemic control measures and pandemic-related changes to daily life, resilience might be further challenged, and stress might consequently increase. Therefore, we review the evidence on informal caregivers’ experience during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding effects of the pandemic control measures on (a) the caregiver’s health, (b) the care recipient’s health, (c) the stability of the care situation, and (d) coping in daily life. We conclude with implications on how to strengthen resilience and reduce stress in terms of environmental, social, and individual resources.
