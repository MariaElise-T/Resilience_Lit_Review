Multiscale resilience, i.e., coordinating different scales within a system to jointly cope and mitigate risks on any single scale, is identified as the feature of a complex resilient system. However, in water distribution systems (WDSs) and urban drainage systems (UDSs), the inherent resilience is usually not multiscale resilience. By referring to the larger scale to larger pipes serving both local users and some other users at smaller scales, it can be found that smaller scales are not responsible for providing resilience to cope with failures in larger scales. These are because the main function of traditional water systems is to deliver water from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates that improving multiscale resilience in WDSs and UDSs needs to allow water to travel reversely in the system via providing extra capacities and/or connections at smaller scales. This hypothesis is verified via case studies on a real world WDS and UDS.
