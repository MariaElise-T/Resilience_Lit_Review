Under the context of global climate change patterns and trends, rural India faces heightened vulnerability to changing weather conditions, leading to various shocks and stresses that can forcibly displace a growing number of its residents. This displacement exacerbates issues of poverty, food insecurity, and marginalization in these populations. A recent strategy to address this challenge is climate resilient agriculture (CRA), an approach aimed at improving community and individual resilience within the context of climate change by sustainably utilizing natural resources through crop and livestock production systems.
This research project, titled the "Climate-Resilient Agriculture and Migration Dynamics in Maharashtra: A Comparative Analysis," seeks to analyze the impacts of CRA programs on migration dynamics in rural India. The primary goal is to assess the diverse designs of CRA initiatives, their implementation and governance mechanisms, and their relative effectiveness in building resilient rural development and mitigating forced displacement due to climate change.
The study will entail an extensive literature review of case studies examining the effects of climate-resilient agriculture in rural India. Additionally, field studies conducted by the project supervisor, Dr. Marcus Taylor, the Department Head and Professor of Global Development at Queenâ€™s University with expertise in agriculture, livelihoods, and anti-poverty policies in rural India and other regions, will complement the research.
By identifying more sustainable adaptation approaches to address the challenges of forced migration for vulnerable populations, this research aims to contribute to improved policy responses, particularly in the Global South. The study's timeliness is emphasized by recent agro-ecological impacts in India due to extreme climate variability. Understanding the relationship between climate-induced migration and climate-resilient agriculture could have significant implications for international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization in shaping effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Ultimately, this research strives to advance knowledge in the realm of climate resilience and its impact on migration dynamics, paving the way for enhanced socio-economic outcomes and improved climate change response mechanisms.
