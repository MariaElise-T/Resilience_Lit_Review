With the wide deployment of renewable energies, future power grids become more vulnerable to extreme environments. This paper investigates enhancing the resilience of power systems with high penetrations of renewable energies under emergencies. The resilience enhancement firstly is defined as maintaining as much electric energy to critical loads in a fixed number of post-disaster periods by properly coordinating the available resources. Then, an optimal decision-making method is proposed to maximize the power supply of critical loads and to minimize the instability risks due to the randomness of the output power of renewable energies. The power consumption of loads, charging/discharging power of power storage plants, power generation of generators, and spinning reserve ratios of the renewable energy at each period are taken as decision variables. Constraints include spinning reserve, power flow constraints, and power consumption/generation limits. The interior-point algorithm is used to solve the formulated optimization problem. Numerical simulations verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed optimization method in boosting grid resilience after disasters. It is also found that a balance should be sought between decreasing stability risks and increasing the power supply benefit in extreme environments.
