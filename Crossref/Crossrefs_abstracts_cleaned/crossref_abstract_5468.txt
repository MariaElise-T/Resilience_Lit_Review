Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has required health care professionals to cope with an unexpected emergency situation, and to provide solutions for a wide range of problems at the community level. As community social workers work on the macro level and deal with entire communities in emergency situations, the current study examined how well they functioned during the first wave of the pandemic in Israel. The study included in-depth interviews with twenty community social workers who work as managers of community social work departments in Israel. It utilised a qualitative-constructivist perspective. Three main themes were highlighted regarding the managersâ€™ coping with the pandemic: (i) creative thinking, which was reflected in their development of solutions and fundraising, both in general and for special groups in particular; (ii) functional flexibility; and (iii) communal networking with community members and organisations. The unique qualities and personal resources of community social workers in public social services played an important role in their coping with the pandemic, and community practice is critical for dealing with emergency situations. Findings are discussed in light of the theoretical perspectives of resilience. Implications for community practice are outlined.
