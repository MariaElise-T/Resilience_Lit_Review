Nowadays, different types of unexpected turbulence and disruptions lead to challenges and changing conditions of the environment that organisations operate. The previous studies related to crisis response or service recovery have addressed many aspects of the governance of an organisation in reacting to crisis or failure situations, including innovation and bureaucracy, science and politics, and decision-making speed. However, there is still little attention on supporting service organisations to revise and adapt their business services in a coherent manner to overcome the challenges from disruptive events. In order to improve organisational resilience, this paper presents an approach based on the service science perspective for service organisations to adapt their services at the three levels of service science, including the network of service systems, service system, and service levels. The paper also presents a case study of using the proposed approach in cultural organisations and ends with a discussion and some conclusions.
