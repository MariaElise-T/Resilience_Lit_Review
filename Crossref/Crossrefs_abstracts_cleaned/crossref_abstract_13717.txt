IL RUOLO DELL’INTELLIGENZA SOCIALE E DELLA RESILIENZA NELLO SPIEGARE LA TOLLERANZA AL DISAGIO DEGLI STUDENTI: UNO STUDIO DURANTE LA PANDEMIA DI COVID-19 Abstract Understanding the factors that influence or correlate with distress tolerance is very important. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of social intelligence and resilience in explaining college students’ distress tolerance. A descriptive correlational study was carried out on 260 male college students of Farhangian University of Birjand, Iran in 2020/21. They completed Social Intelligence Scale, Resilience Scale, and Distress Tolerance Questionnaire. The results showed that there was a direct and significant relationship between social intelligence and distress tolerance (r = 0.473; p <0.001), as well as resilience and distress tolerance (r = 0.608; p = 0.008). Also, the coefficient of determination showed that the components of social intelligence and resilience up to 65% can explain the variance of students’ distress tolerance. Psychological interventions such as promoting social intelligence and effective resilience can be used to prevent and control the college students’ distress especially during Covid-19 pandemic.
