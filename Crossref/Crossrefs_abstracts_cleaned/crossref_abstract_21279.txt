Increasing climate change is causing complex and diverse natural disasters that have never been experienced before. Recently, research and practical applications of the concept of resilience at the management level for these disasters have been presented. Drought is one of the disasters that lasts for a long time and takes a considerable amount of time for recovery, and resilience evaluations reflecting regional characteristics are needed. In this study, we aim to present the applicability of the resilience concept that reflects regional characteristics (whether or not drought has been experienced in the past) in droughts. To this end, 18 qualitative and quantitative indicators for the evaluation of drought resilience were proposed by judging overseas cases, data status, and domestic applicability. A methodology for calculating the proposed indicators through quantitative data analysis and surveys was presented, and detailed drought resilience evaluations were conducted based on two regions in Korea (Chungcheongnam-do and Chungcheongbuk-do). Through the resilience evaluation using this methodology, the drought response capacity of each local government could be comprehensively evaluated from various perspectives, and each determined factors for improving drought resilience. If a nationwide evaluation is conducted in the future based on these results, locally appropriate guidelines related to drought response and recovery can be established.
