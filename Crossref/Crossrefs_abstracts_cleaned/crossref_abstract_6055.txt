The research on the relationship between family resilience and group well-being of high school students has been popular and representative in recent years, but at present, the relationship between the two has not been thoroughly discussed in China. This paper explores the relationship between the two from the perspective of parental rearing patterns. First of all, this paper analyzes the conclusion that the factors that affect students' individual health and happiness in school education and their positive emotional experience are positively correlated with the level of family psychological resilience, and then studies the relationship between family psychological resilience and group happiness of high school students through questionnaire survey. The survey results show that the psychological resilience and team well-being of high school students are above the middle level, and the overall level is good, and there are significant gender differences and grade differences, and there are also significant positive correlation and regression effects between them, which indicates that psychological resilience has a certain degree of predictive effect on subjective well-being.
