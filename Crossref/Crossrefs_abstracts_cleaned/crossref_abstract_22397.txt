Abstract
Recently, much attention has been focused on designing provably secure cryptographic primitives in the presence of key leakage, even the continuous leakage attacks. However, several constructions on the (continuous) leakage-resilient certificate-based encryption (CBE) scheme were proposed based on the bilinear pairings, and the corresponding computational efficiency is lower. Also, the leakage on the master secret key is omitted in the previous constructions. In this paper, to further achieve the better performance, a new construction method of continuous leakage-resilient CBE scheme without bilinear pairings is proposed, and the chosen-ciphertext attacks security of designed scheme is proved based on the hardness of the classic decisional Diffieâ€“Hellman assumption. The performance analysis shows that our method not only can obtain higher computational efficiency but also enjoys better security performances, such as the leakage parameter of secret key of user has the constant size, and an adversary cannot obtain any leakage on the secret key of user from the corresponding given ciphertext etc. The advantage is that our proposal allows leakage attacks of multiple keys, i.e. continuous leakage resilience of the secret key of user and bounded leakage resilience of the master secret key. Additionally, to provide the leakage resilience for the cloud computing, a novel data access control scheme for cloud storage service is proposed from our continuous leakage-resilient CBE scheme, which can keep its claimed security in the leakage seting.
