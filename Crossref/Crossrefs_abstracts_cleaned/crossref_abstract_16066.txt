PurposeThis study examines the interactions between entrepreneurial orientation, supply chain resilience (SCRES) as well as the financial and commercial dimensions of business performance.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on a literature review, the authors develop a research model to identify positive relationships between five specific dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation, SCRES and business performance based on the dynamic capabilities view. The hypotheses are then empirically validated by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) on survey data obtained from a questionnaire and 168 global companies.FindingsThe results partially support the hypotheses and suggest that entrepreneurial activities complement the resilience of supply chains to sudden disruptions and therefore also foster competitive advantage.Originality/valueThe relationships between entrepreneurial orientation, SCRES and business performance are examined and validated empirically in a single model, bridging the gap between these distinct research streams and shedding further light on supply chain risk management.
