The arena of metacognition has been studied in various disciplines including education, psychology, positive psychology, and neuroscience, however, research studies have yet to address the role of metacognition in enhancing resilience. Thus, the present study explored how metacognitive intervention strategies enhance resilience among pre-service teachers. The understanding of resilience may act as a catalyst for pre-service teachers to overcome difficulties during and after their training period. An experimental method with a single group design was employed in this study and the sample was 20 pre-service teachers undertaking the Bachelor of Education course at Alagappa University College of Education, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, Sivagangai district, Tamil Nadu, India. The convenience sampling technique was utilized for this study. A metacognitive awareness questionnaire constructed and validated by the researcher and research supervisor with a Cronbach’s alpha reliability of the present sample is 0.72 and a Resilience Appraisal Scale (RAS) developed by Johnson et al., 2010 with Cronbach’s alpha reliability of the present sample is 0.75 were used for data collection. Results revealed that metacognitive intervention strategies influence the resilience of pre-service teachers and considerable improvement present in resilience among pre-service teachers after the experimentation period. Future research needs to focus on various dimensions of resilience for extensive knowledge and survey research would encourage measuring these constructs in the larger sample.
