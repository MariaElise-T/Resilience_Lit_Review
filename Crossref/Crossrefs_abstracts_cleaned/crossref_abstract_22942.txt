 Climate change represents a serious threat to global agriculture, necessitating the development of more environmentally resilient crops to safeguard the future of food production. The effects of climate change are appearing to include a higher frequency of extreme weather events and increased day-to-day weather variability. As such, crops which are able to cope with short-term environmental stress, in addition to those that are tolerant to longer term stress conditions are required . It is becoming apparent that the hitherto relatively little studied process of post-stress plant recovery could be key to optimizing growth and production under fluctuating conditions with intermittent transient stress events. Developing more durable crops requires the provision of genetic resources to identify useful traits through the development of screening protocols. Such traits can then become the objective of crop breeding programmes. In this study, we discuss these issues and outline example research in leafy vegetables that is investigating resilience to short-term abiotic stress.
