The paper seeks to examine the effect of knowledge management on resilience and performance of emergent financial technology startups (Fintechs) in Lahore, Pakistan through the development of dynamic capabilities when confronted with environmental dynamism. Based on the tentative deductions derived from Dynamic Capability View (DCV)  of emergent financial sector ventures, this paper employs Partial Least Square for Structured  Equation Modeling to investigate these hypotheses. Sample of current cross-sectional study involves empirical analysis performed on primary data assembled from knowledge workers employed in emergent financial technology startups. Knowledge management practices also have a positive impact on the developing dynamic capabilities of the organization. Implementation of effective knowledge management practices results in reconfiguring and advancing the companies’ dynamic competencies under the conditions of dynamism and unexpected changes occurring in the external business environment.  Consequently, fin-techs succeed in accomplishing their goals of spirit, adaptive capacity i.e. increased resilience and escalated performance.
