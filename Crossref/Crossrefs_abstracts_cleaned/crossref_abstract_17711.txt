PurposeThis study aims to examine the direct and indirect effects of supply chain resilience enablers on supply chain disruption orientation per supply chain resilience. It conjointly examined the moderation of supply chain complexity on resilience enablers and supply chain resilience. It further detailed the conditional indirect effects of supply chain resilience enablers on supply chain disruption orientations via supply chain resilience at varying levels of supply chain complexity.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a time-lagged design (three-wave) and self-administered surveys to collect data from the supply chain managers of fast-moving consumer goods firms. A sample of 214 responses was used to test the hypothesized relationships.FindingsThe results showed that supply chain resilience significantly mediated on the relationship between supply chain resilience enablers and supply chain disruption orientation. Further, supply chain complexity positively moderated on supply chain resilience enablers and supply chain resilience. The results also supported the moderated mediated hypothesis.Research limitations/implicationsThis study contributes to prevalent theory and practices in the wake of recent disruptions faced by the firms. It persuades the managers to emphasize on structuring resilient supply chain system to recover from the disruptions and accumulate and incorporate learning gained from the disruptions to strengthen the firm's response management system.Originality/valueThis study attempted to explore the underlying antecedents and consequences of supply chain resilience in Pakistan and established boundary condition effects of supply chain complexity on the proposed relationships. This research complemented and extended the conceits of resource-based and contingent resource-based views.
