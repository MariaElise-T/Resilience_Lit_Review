 The Pain Resilience Scale (PRS) is a useful tool that evaluates behavioral engagement and adaptively regulates cognitions and emotions despite the pain. This study aimed to translate the PRS to Turkish and investigate its psychometric properties. The Turkish version of PRS was completed online by 332 healthy adults, and a subset of 105 respondents was re-assessed after 7–14 days. The reliability of the adapted measure was evaluated in terms of internal consistency, relative, and absolute test-retest reliability. Validity was evaluated in terms of structural, construct, and known-group validity using positive and negative psychological scales. The Turkish version of PRS has a three-factor structure and its cumulative variance is 78.06%. The total PRS score and its subscales correlated positively with pain self-efficacy, general resilience, and quality of life, and negatively with pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety, depression, and disability. The PRS scores were significantly higher in those with high general resilience ( p < 0.001). The PRS had high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and Minimum Detectable Difference (MDD) were calculated as 2.9 and 8.0, respectively. The Turkish version of PRS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring pain resilience in terms of behavioral perseverance and cognitive positivity.
