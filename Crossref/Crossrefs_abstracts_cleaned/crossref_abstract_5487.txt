Adverse life experiences have been linked with a wide range of negative outcomes. However, despite being exposed to adversity, individuals who exhibit high levels of resilience appear to be less impacted by adversity, and continue to function normally. Using self–report measures and a sample of 161 participants aged between 16 and 21, the present study aimed to identify whether exposure to adverse experiences, locus of control (LOC), academic delay of gratification and age could predict resilience in young students. Two significant individual predictors of resilience were identified: the amount of adversity within an individual’s relationship with their parents/guardians; and LOC. Specifically, the lack of adversity within the relationship with parents/guardians and an internal LOC were found to predict higher levels of resilience. These results will be discussed in relation to increasing resilience in students and young people.
