AbstractBackgroundResilience is dynamic and influenced by internal and external factors. In persons with chronic illness and/or disability, resilience is viewed as the ability to adapt to new life circumstances. Existing models of resilience typically focus on the absence of deficit and pathology in the individual, overlooking resources, well-being, and broader social impacts. Our proposed novel Relational, Intrapersonal, Social and Environmental (RISE) Model of resilience incorporates and describes the interconnection and influence of constructs that impact resilience and affect the quality of life.PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine the fit of the RISE Model against original interview data obtained from persons with stroke and their partners.MethodsThis study is a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected from post-intervention interviews that were part of an intervention pilot study designed to promote resilience in couples coping with stroke. Interviews were coded to examine relationships between RISE Model constructs.ResultsThe study included 36 interviews from 18 cohabitating couples; mean participant age was 53.33 years (SD Â±14.70). Examples of each construct within the RISE Model appeared in transcribed interviews and common patterns of co-occurring constructs were identified.ConclusionThe constructs within the RISE Model were supported by the interviews. The impact of disability does not remain confined to a single individual and instead branches out into the broader social context, including close interpersonal relationships. A deeper understanding of resilience and its relationship with intrapersonal, interpersonal and socio-ecological constructs would add value to our understanding and fostering of resilience in persons with disabilities and/or chronic illness.Clinical Trial informationNCT03335358.
