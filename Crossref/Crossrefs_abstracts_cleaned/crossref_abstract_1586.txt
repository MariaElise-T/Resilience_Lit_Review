 Objective: To determine, by using a naturalistic experiment resulting from Covid and Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, if a previously completed comprehensive intervention within a Mozambiqian village by the Non-Governmental Organization Care-for-Life ( CFL), resulted in community empowerment in the community's response to these disasters, as defined by World Bank. Method: Over a nine-month period, beginning three weeks post-cyclones (November 2019), data were collected using mixed research methods, including in-depth interviews (22), focus group discussions (four), pre–post household surveys, and nonparticipatory observations. Results: Quantitative results demonstrated that the village responded effectively by decreasing disease, increasing sanitation, and providing food security to community members. Using thematic analysis of focus group discussions and interviews, several themes were identified documenting the community's and village leaders’ responses. Discussion: This mixed-methods study demonstrated that the comprehensive CFL interventions were effective in empowering community leaders and members, and in building resiliency in responding to disasters.
