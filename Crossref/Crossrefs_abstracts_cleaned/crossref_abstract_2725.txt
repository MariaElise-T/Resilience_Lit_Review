The article reveals the manifestations of hardiness in medical residents as a factor of the professional adaptation. Medical workers are a risk group in terms of emotional burnout and other emotional disorders, since they directly interact with patientsâ€™ various somatic profiles, as well as a high professional responsibility. The formation and strengthening of resilience in medical personnel is an important task, since resilience is a psychological factor that enables people to successfully cope with stressful situations and reduces internal tension. The study was conducted by clinical psychologists at the Astrakhan State Medical University Astrakhan, Russia) in October 2022. It included clinical residents of the specialties Obstetrics and Gynecology (30 people) and Surgery (28 people). Our study has found that young medical residents have rather high levels of hardiness. This may be attributed to the age of the respondents, since they are at the first stages of their professional activities. A high indicator of "Engagement" was recorded for clinical residents, reflecting their determination and resilience. However, indicators of hardiness and satisfaction in the specialty "Obstetrics and Gynecology" were significantly lower than in the specialty "Surgery". On the basis of the study, a program of psychological support was developed facilitating stress prevention and formation of coping resources and self-regulation in young professionals.
