AbstractBackgroundIndividual differences in brain structure have been associated with variation in brain atrophy and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying genetic mechanisms that dictate structural differences are not fully understood. Recent advances in large‐scale immunohistochemistry (IHC) now make it feasible to quantify region‐specific changes in cell composition and relate such changes to both clinically relevant traits (cognitive resilience) and gene expression for novel mechanistic insight.MethodForty hemibrains of adult and middle‐aged AD‐BXD strains, a translational mouse model of human AD, were stained to evaluate neurodegeneration (NeuN), gliosis (Iba1&GFAP), and AD‐specific pathology (AB1‐42) using IHC. Individual differences in cellular composition were quantified using % coverage of each stain across multiple brain regions obtained from the QUINT workflow, in which experimental slices were systematically segmented and registered to the Allen Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework. Cellular composition changes in hippocampus were then compared to bulk hippocampal gene expression levels to identify cellular and molecular correlates of resilience to AD.ResultThe % coverage of hippocampal GFAP+ astrocytes, Iba1+ microglia, and AB1‐42+ pathology increased with age and correlated with genes enriched for immune‐related pathways, chromatin remodeling, and mRNA processing. Neuronal cell load (% NeuN coverage) in the hippocampus of AD‐BXD mice was associated with genes enriched for GABA receptor activity, NMDA activation, extracellular matrix integrity, and autophagy. Moreover, in aged mice, genes positively correlated with NeuN coverage were enriched for cognition. This was further supported by the association between % NeuN coverage and improved cognition as measured by better performance on contextual fear memory tasks.ConclusionUsing bulk RNAseq we were able to associate greater glial cell load with increased gene expression and explore pathways correlated with cellular composition in AD‐BXDs; however, it is unclear whether the variation in gene expression is a result of changes in the transcriptional activity of genes in these pathways, cell composition changes, or both. Integration of snRNAseq and brain‐wide quantitative maps will enable us to disentangle gene expression changes from cell composition, and perform genome‐wide studies to map the loci responsible for modulating these changes that underlie resilience in AD.
