AbstractIndividual factors are critical in navigating adversity; however, the influence of social ecologies on resilience should not be undervalued. Factors such as a relationship with caregivers, and contextual factors (i.e. culture, spirituality, education), serve as resilience enablers. This article investigated the role of caregivers and context as mediators on the impact of individual factors on resilience among learners presenting with Specific Learning Disability (SLD) at schools for Learners with Special Needs (LSEN). An explanatory quantitative research design was adopted, and mediation model was employed as the conceptual framework. Mediation models were developed for this study and regression analysis was used to test the models. The sample (N = 217 respondents) of this study was purposefully selected. The hypothesis was that individual factors have an impact on resilience. However, caregivers and context factors mediate this impact. The Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) was used to collect data. Results confirmed that although there are individual factors that enable resilience, the individual’s caregivers, and other factors in their context, strengthen their resilience development. The results of the study revealed that resilience of learners with SLD was enabled by a combination of individual factors and social-ecological factors (such as, caregivers and context). Therefore, a combination of factors is involved in the development of resilience.
