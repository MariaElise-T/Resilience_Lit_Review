Energy security and implicitly the regional energy architecture composed of critical energy infrastructures (power substations and overhead lines at 400 kV), can undergo various mutations and transformations caused by a possible syncope in the extraction, transport and exploitation of energy resources and energy, due to energy dynamism. The vulnerability of these critical energy infrastructures generates a number of risks and threats to them, thus endangering societal life, creating malfunctions and generating extreme damage to the state. Critical energy infrastructures thus become indispensable to society, without which the state and its mechanisms cannot function and ensure societal well-being, and their protection becomes a major national and European objective, prompting representatives of the member states of the European Union to take action to identify and manage any risk or threat. In the face of the vulnerabilities, threats and risks Romania faces in the new dynamic, turbulent and unpredictable geopolitical context of global, regional and Euro-Atlantic security, amid the military and health crisis and amplified by the global energy crisis manifested by the unfounded and unexpected increase in energy price, the Romanian state should have a strategy for strengthening the resilience of critical energy infrastructures, based on predictability, flexibility, continuity, adaptability and resilience.
