Abstract‘It all comes down tojuok’ is the recurrent answer to enquiries about suffering and misfortune among the Nilotic Jop'Adhola of eastern Uganda. Understanding what it means to ‘believe’ injuokrequires a theoretical approach that recognises culture as a battleground between conflicting voices. This article explores the multiple and often contradictory ways to talk about, practise and believe injuokand how the notion ofjuokintersects with Christianity and biomedicine in ever changing constellations.Juok, it is suggested, can be seen as an image of intersubjective experience that allows the anthropologist insight into ways in which people in Eastern Uganda engage with each other and with the ‘other world’.Juokis one of the things people use when trying to activate events and overcome obstacles in life. As such it reflects the resilience of people confronted with suffering.
