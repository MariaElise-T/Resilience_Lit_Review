 Stigmatization on the basis of race, sexuality, gender identity, and/or use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) exacerbates HIV disparities for young men who have sex with men of color (YMSM). We explored resilience, healthcare experiences, stigma, and impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on PrEP care needs among YMSM of color through virtual in-depth interviews. Analyses used adapted grounded theory/constant comparison. Regarding healthcare-based stigma, participants enacted multilevel resilience which was critical to their care retention during COVID-19 (Themes 1 and 2). Some participants noted that remote care could minimize healthcare stigma and promote retention in care and/or on PrEP (Theme 3). Participants were interested in long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP but expressed concerns about cost, effectiveness, and side effects (Theme 4). Community-based venues like pharmacies were preferred spaces for getting LAI PrEP injections (Theme 4). Although expansion of telehealth that helped mitigate care retention challenges during COVID-19 was temporary, continued telehealth use may reduce stigmatization and promote long-term retention and PrEP persistence.
