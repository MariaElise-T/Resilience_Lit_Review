Having a resilient workforce is crucial to enhancing organisational competitiveness in an era of intensifying global competition. However, few organisations see resilience as part of the soft skills and attitudes that can be developed strategically. This study examines nine dimensions of resilience of over 1500 banking employees and 310 university students being trained for the industry. The study shows that gender, age and education level affect the level of resilience. It also reveals that performance pressure does not seem to have detrimental effect on the bank employees' resilience. The study points to a number of research and management implications and highlights the need to provide tailored training and development to increase the resilience level of employees. It also provides indications of the types of skills that universities should help their students develop in order to better prepare them for their future employment.
