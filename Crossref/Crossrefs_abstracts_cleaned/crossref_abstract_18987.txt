Purpose: Pediatric cancer is a difficult experience for children and their families. It is thus necessary to promote family resilience for the effective treatment and quality of life improvement among children with cancer. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the components of a resilience-promoting program for children with cancer and their families and to synthesize the literature findings on the outcomes of the resilience-promoting program. Method: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using five databases (PubMed, CHIAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Research Information Sharing Service) up to July 22, 2020. The search was limited to studies published in English and Korean, and to grey literature published in Korea. Studies were critically appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Extracted data were summarized as tables. Results: Eight studies were selected. The main components of the resilience-promoting program were providing information (on strategies, medical and psychoeducation, and community resources) and emotional coping (expressing feeling, reappraising cognition about adversity, and stress management). The main outcomes of these programs were reinforced outcomes (resilience, benefit finding, coping, positive affect, problem-solving skills, family adaptation, and self-concept) and improved outcomes (in depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, impact of illness of the family, and mood). Conclusion: As the components and outcomes of family resilience-promoting programs vary, it is necessary to consistently use valid tools to effectively identify interventions. Additionally, various methodological studies are required to further analyze the effect of these programs.
