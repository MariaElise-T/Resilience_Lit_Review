 Resilience is of great importance for teams working in complex and unstable environments. Team resilience is the ability of the teams/groups to bounce back and sustain in the facade of adverse conditions. Research reveals that resilient teams are more likely to be productive, agile and innovative during the turbulent times. However, despite the growing importance of the concept, there is lack of reliable and valid scale to measure team resilience in the literature. Keeping this gap in mind the study aims to design and develop a reliable and valid measure to assess the resilience capacity of the teams. Findings of the study reveal that team resilience is a hierarchical and multidimensional scale comprising of four primary dimensions along with 10 sub-dimensions. Psychometric evaluation and validation has been done using 160 responses from 12 IT companies located in India. The instrument may be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying team resilience capacity and thereby acts as a starting point for increasing team resilience. Moreover, identifying teams with lower resilience scores may assist organizations in tailoring strategies that might improve the teamsâ€™ effectiveness.
