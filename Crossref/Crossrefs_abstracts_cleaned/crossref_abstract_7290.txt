Australians have experienced repetitive exposure to climate change adversity (either in-person or through televised exposure from media and internet sources). As these events become more prevalent and severe, developing, and implementing strategies to enhance emotional resilience at individual, community, and government levels is beneficial. This literature review examines one way of addressing this issue: enhancement of societal emotional resilience capabilities that can minimize negative impacts of climate change adversity upon emotional wellbeing. The study also offers an initial exploration of climate change adversity and emotional resilience. A systematic literature review identified key research themes. Subsequent findings identified policy and framework recommendations aimed at supporting emotional resilience in communities. Such strategies should focus on community preparedness through needs-based assessments and community engagement, fostering knowledge-building pathways and ongoing collaboration among system levels to address a diversity of community needs. These systematic approaches would ensure the accessibility and appropriateness of relevant supports by establishing frameworks that are regularly monitored, evaluated, and promoted.
