Abstract
Resilience is proposed as one of the main characteristics a contemporary supply chain system should possess in order to deal with the uncertainties created by the latest environmental, economic, and social crises. Especially in the case of the agri-food supply chains, the need to ensure that they are capable of responding to such disruptions has started to lead to the implementation of new practices considering the creation of more resilient and adaptable agri-food supply chain systems. This transitioning can be complicated as the integration of new practices involves the overcoming of certain barriers that occur. The aim of this research is to identify and discuss the critical success factors for the creation of resilient agri-food supply chains.
