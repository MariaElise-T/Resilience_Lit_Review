To keep the spread of the novel coronavirus down people are asked to continue following social distancing guidelines, which can impact employment and feelings of connectedness. Many people have not seen loved ones in-person for months. These are all very difficult on oneâ€™s mental health.

We can look to persons with lived experience of mental health conditions as examples of how to develop resiliency.
