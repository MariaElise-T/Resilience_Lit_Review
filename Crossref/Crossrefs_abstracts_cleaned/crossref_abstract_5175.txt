One of the internal resources being performed to have a better performance in different aspects of the individual life is resilience. The quality of resilience is frequently attributed to individuals who overcome all challenges and problems in life. The purpose of this study was to analyze the presence of correlation between resilience as a trait and neighborhood as an environmental factor. Wherein, neighborhood was further classified into five (5) underlying factors namely, the Physical Order, the Land Use and Service, the Social Norms and Values, the Social Capital, and, the Social order. This quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational study has utilized self-rated standardized questionnaires— the Brief Resiliency Scale of 2008 by Smith, B. W., Dalen, J., Wiggins, K., Tooley, E., Christopher, P., & Bernard, J., and the Perceived Neighborhood Scale of 2013 by Gariepy G, Smith KJ, Schmitz N. The sample consisted of eighty (80) selected participants in Barangay San Roque, Murphy, Quezon City. Based on the results of the study, two (2) among neighborhood underlying factors were found to have significant negative relationship with resilience, specifically the Physical order (p=0.047) and the Social order (p= 0.023). Conversely, there was no significant relationship found between resilience and the other underlying factors of neighborhood. Hence, it is recommended that future researches should further focus on other factors that may have stronger link with resilience such as local community and family support, and/or educational environment and teacher bonding for student populations.ReferencesAnderson, P., Jane-llopis, E., &Hosman, C.
