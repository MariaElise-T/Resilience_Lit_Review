In areas of civil engineering, the resilient friction base isolator (R-FBI) system has been used due to its enhanced isolation performance under seismic excitations. However, because nonlinear behavior of the R-FBI should be reflected in seismic design, effective stiffness (Keff) of the R-FBI is uniformly applied at both peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.08 g and 0.154 g which use a multimodal response spectrum (RS) method analysis. For rational seismic design of bridges, it should be required to evaluate the dynamics of the R-FBI from in-field tests and to improve the seismic design procedure based on the performance level of the bridges. The objective of this study is to evaluate the dynamics of the R-FBI and to suggest the performance-based seismic design method for cable-supported bridges with the R-FBI. From the comparison between the experimentsâ€™ results and modal shape analyses, the modal shape analyses using primary (Ku) or infinite stiffness (fixed end) showed a great agreement with the experimental results compared to the application of Keff in the shape analysis. Additionally, the RS or nonlinear time history method analyses by the PGA levels should be applied by reflecting the dynamic characteristics of the R-FBI for the reasonable and efficient seismic design.
