 Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic materials) demonstrate the fascinating property of becoming fatter when stretched. This phenomenon is fundamentally important to the properties of a material and a significant change in the value of the ratio has significant effects on the material's mechanical performance. This article describes foams with a negative Poisson's ratio that show better indentation resilience than conventional foams with a positive Poisson's ratio. The unusual mechanical properties of auxetic foams are attributed to the deformation characteristics of re-entrant (concave polyhedral) cell structures.
