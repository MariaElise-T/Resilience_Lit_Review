Abstract
During a flood event, flood-affected households need adequate flood resilience. The efforts to increase household flood resilience require an adequate understanding of the factors affecting household flood resilience. This study aimed to explore the factors influencing household flood resilience in three flood-affected sub-districts in Tangerang City, Indonesia. The composite indicator method was applied to process data on economic, home environment, social capital, institutional, communication and information, and flood risk perception, using questionnaire data from 354 flood-affected households as respondents and in-depth interviews with local leaders. The results showed that the composite indicator method worked well for measuring the household flood resilience index (HFRI); in the Gembor sub-district, HFRI was 2.88; in Gebang Raya, it was 3.12; and in Periuk, it was 3.03. Analysis based on economic conditions, flood depth, period of residence, and flood risk perception also showed variations in HFRI, which could determine methods to increase household flood resilience. In conclusion, the composite indicator method is an adequate tool to measure flood resilience despite it being an abstract object. Furthermore, the local government can use the HFRI to develop planning efforts to increase household flood resilience based on influencing factors.
