Abstract
Successful aging has been defined as functional resilience in late life despite history of chronic disease and/or concurrent medical conditions. Old age therefore may not be synonymous with ill health. We reported that octo-/nonagenarians who are survivors of a long-term cohort of aging have a distinct T cell repertoire expressing diverse NK-related receptors (NKR). Frequency of these unusual T cells is correlated with unimpaired physical/cognitive function. To determine whether broader repertoire remodeling relates to general well being, we recruited a new cohort of community dwelling elders aged &gt;65 years. Results showed physical/cognitive ability is unrelated with systemic cytokines, but with high levels of NKR on both T and NK cells, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in plasma. Bioassays showed NKR ligation is sufficient to induce T/NK cell activation, and an unexpected production of BDNF. BDNF in culture supernatants and plasma was biologically active as determined by measurable impact on autocrine T/NK cell activation, and on paracrine neurite sprouting and myotube function. Clearly, physical/cognitive resilience is linked to remodeling of the immune cell repertoire. T/NK-derived BDNF indicate unique communication circuit(s) of immune, physical, and cognitive function domains. Unraveling NKR-driven non-TCR centric immunopathway(s) will be key to the development of age-appropriate, group-targeted strategies to promote healthy longevity.
