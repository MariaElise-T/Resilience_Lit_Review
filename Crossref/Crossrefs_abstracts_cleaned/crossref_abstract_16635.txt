Building on the resilience literature, this study analyzes the response networks that were activated for four disasters during 2015–2016 (Cyclone Pam, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, Cyclone Winston, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake). The analysis shows that different interrelated resilient capacities are manifested in the activation of response networks. In particular, in exhibiting redundancy and robustness, disaster‐specific network structures are discerned. In both cyclones, response networks resemble a predefined cluster design, whereas in the earthquake disasters, networks are more fluid. Moreover, organizations' varied levels of prior response experiences help build the network's capacities of redundancy and resourcefulness. Implications are discussed in ways to advance contributions to research on resilience and disaster response networks.
