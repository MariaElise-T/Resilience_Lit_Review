The assessment of the seismic risk connected with the functionality of infrastructure has become an important issue in civil engineering, and consists of estimating costs due to earthquakes. In this regard, bridges are the most vulnerable systems among the various components of road infrastructure and the assessment of their resilience has recently been proposed. However, the development of methodologies that can assess the resilience of the full road infrastructure still constitutes a gap in the literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel methodology to include direct and indirect losses using a probability-based approach. A case study was carried out to investigate a road network consisting of two interdependent infrastructures.
