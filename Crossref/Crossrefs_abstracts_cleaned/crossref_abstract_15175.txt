 It has been shown that relative humidity exerts a definite effect on the physical properties of a mass of asbestos fibre. A special apparatus has been devised in which a mass of fibre may be compressed in such a way that the volume, pressure and relative humidity of the sample are known at any time. The effect of sorbed water on asbestos is to increase the apparent density and to decrease compressibility and resiliency. It has been assumed that the major factor which controls these characteristics is the fact that sorption of water affects the surface in such manner that the slippage of the fibres over one another is facilitated. Since no fibre unit is experimentally obtainable in the case of asbestos, the fibre bundle must be considered and the stiffness of such a bundle depends on the ease of slippage of its components and hence on relative humidity. This fact is of prime importance in the testing of asbestos where humidity will exert a direct effect on the screen test.Cotton and wool fibres have been examined, and a definite effect of humidity demonstrated. Certain theoretical speculations in the case of cotton have been put forward.
