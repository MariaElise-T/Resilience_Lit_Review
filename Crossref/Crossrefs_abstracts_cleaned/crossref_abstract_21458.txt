AbstractAims and objectivesThis study examines the effects of family beliefs and family strength on individual resilience and quality of life among young breast cancer survivors and determines whether family strength mediates the effect of family beliefs on individual resilience and quality of life.BackgroundFamily beliefs and family strength are meaningful protective factors that help individuals maintain physical and mental health. However, few studies have explored their impact on individual resilience and quality of life.DesignThis study was conducted using a cross‐sectional survey with a three‐stage, stratified, convenience sampling approach following the STROBE guideline.MethodsFrom August 2020 to May 2021, participants completed the shortened Chinese version of the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, the Chinese version of the Family Beliefs Scale, the Family Strength Scale and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Breast scale. Structural equation modelling and multiple mediation effects test were used to explore the relationships among family beliefs, family strength, individual resilience and quality of life.ResultsThe final model accounted for 44.5% and 78.1% of the total variance of individual resilience and quality of life, respectively. Family beliefs had an indirect effect on both individual resilience and quality of life through family strength. Family strength had a direct effect on individual resilience and had both a direct and an indirect effect on quality of life. Family strength mediated the correlations of family beliefs with individual resilience and quality of life.ConclusionMobilising family resources to establish healthy family beliefs and exert positive family strength will help increase young breast cancer survivors’ individual resilience and improve quality of life.Relevance to clinical practiceThis study confirms the importance for clinical nursing practice to mobilise family resources and develop interventions centred on family beliefs and family strength.
