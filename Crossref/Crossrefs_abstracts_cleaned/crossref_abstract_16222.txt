This study aims to find an extraordinary strategy to realize rural resilience through a digital village. The study used a qualitative method with case studies in two villages: i) Cijengkol Village and ii) Sepakung Village. This study finds the importance of digitalization starting from the village. The apparatus and community of Cijengkol Village are increasingly enjoying the benefits of digitization to complete various daily affairs. Meanwhile, Sepakung Village has published its natural wealth and tourism digitally. The digital village is one of the ideal solutions for rural resilience in the digital era. Human capital is the main factor.
