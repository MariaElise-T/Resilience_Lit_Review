This study explores potential variables influencing victim blaming. An empirical analysis is conducted with a focus on the concepts presented in the culpable control model and the defensive attribution theory, both of which explain victim blaming. This article further explores whether community resilience can reduce victim blaming. A survey was conducted on 210 adults and the results reveals a positive correlation between negative emotions and victim blaming. Victim blaming increases in cases where there was no similarity between the victim and the observer compared to where there is a similarity. It is also analyzed that the group with high community resilience has fewer victim blaming than the group with low community resilience. Finally, as the results of exploring the variables affecting negative emotions, it is confirmed that the higher the uncertainty about disaster risk, the higher the negative emotions related to disaster events. This study discusses the theoretical and practical implications based on the results.
