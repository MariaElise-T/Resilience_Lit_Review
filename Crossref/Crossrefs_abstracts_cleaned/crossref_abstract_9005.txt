Abstract

Background
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with health outcomes. Resilience factors provide opportunities to mitigate ACEs. This study aimed to understand ACEs and resilience in students at a university in the United States.


Methods
Students in the 2018-2019 health explorations course completed an online questionnaire (N = 82). Descriptive statistics were completed for all variables. ACE score was created by adding yes responses to ACE questions (range 0-10). Resilience scores were calculated using the Devereux Adult Resilience Scale (DARS, range 20-46). Simple and multiple linear regression were completed with ACE and resilience as outcome measures. Age, gender, family structure, and profession were used as predictors.


Results
Mean age was 18.4 (SD 1.9%), majority of respondents were female (89%), white (92.7%), rural (55.3%), and single (95.1%). Mean ACE score was 1.63 (SD = 1.99) with 40% reporting no ACEs, 26% three or more, and 18% four or more. DARS score (N = 77) had a mean of 39.29 (SD = 6.14). Age resulted in a slight increase in ACE score, β = 0.20, p &lt; 0.1, however, none of the predictors were significantly associated with ACE score. Future professions classified as helping professions resulted in a significant increase in DAR score, β = 3.91, p &lt; 0.01.


Conclusions
The response rate was low (20.5%), however, this pilot study provided insights into adversities and resilience factors of first-year students. Future research should include a larger, more diverse sample.


Key messages
Understanding ACEs and resilience in college students is necessary to mitigate and address ACEs early in adulthood.
