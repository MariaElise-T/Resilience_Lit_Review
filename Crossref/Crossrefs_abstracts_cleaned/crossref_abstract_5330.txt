This paper deals with the problem of resilient finite-time control for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems. The notion of finite-time annular domain stability of stochastic nonlinear systems is first introduced. Then, some sufficient conditions are given for the existence of resilient state feedback finite-time annular domain stabilizing controller, which are expressed in terms of matrix inequalities. A double-parameter searching algorithm is proposed to solve these obtained matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method.
