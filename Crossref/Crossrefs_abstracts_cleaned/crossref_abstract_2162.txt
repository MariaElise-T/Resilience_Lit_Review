Abstract

Background
Anti-trans violence has become the focus in European and international policy as stipulated in the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025. Despite the legal European anti-discrimination law, transgender people are still unable to be themselves without risks of social exclusion, feeling threatened, bullying at school, gender-related violence and hate crimes which negatively impacts their mental health (suicidality, hiding the trans identity).


Methods
Instead of making society more ‘trans sensitive', this study aims to strengthen the resilience of transgender youth (16-25 years old) bottom up, using a co-creative research approach. Inspired by the Lundy Model of child participation, transgender youth received a voice, platform and safe space to influence society. Thematically-analyzed data was gathered through focus groups (using creative techniques) in a co-creation session at the university hospital of Ghent.


Results
To increase their resilience, transgender youth want to (1) provide training for educational staff, develop didactic material and create safe coming-out environments, (2) participate in social activities focusing on gender expression, create social scripts, (3) improve self-confidence with techniques like Rock and water and self-defense programs, (4) participate in creative workshops to cope with stress and anxiety, (5) tell positive stories to tackle stereotypes. Based on this input from the co-creation session we will set up modules to strengthen their resilience.


Conclusions
The central question in research and practice should be how to take what they believe is necessary to become more resilient, take their challenges into account and how to use this to raise awareness on transphobia among trans people and international (trans)organizations.


Key messages
• To strengthen resilience in transgender youth by listening to their voices.
• To increase awareness, knowledge and skills of professionals regarding transgender people.
