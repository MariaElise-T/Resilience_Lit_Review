Abstract
Urban communities around the world are facing sudden acute stress associated with the effects of the Covid19 pandemic, making them more vulnerable to dealing with trauma and shock. Cities need to be able to remain stable function in the event of stress. This can be achieved if the local resources are best-networked and utilized. To this end, urban planning must integrate appropriate GI such as urban agriculture and community gardens that can increase the adaptability of the city. As a result, the role of GI and its implementation need to be revisited to encourage a culture of resilient communities. In this framework, this paper promotes healthy human and natural systems in urban environments, while providing the most valuable and necessary ecosystem services delivered by GI to build community resilience, such as community gardens. Examine the role of community-based GI for an era where lush cities and the luxury of public spaces do not provide enough positive value to people currently affected by the pandemic. To that end, this study is a descriptive comparison of stories to understand the relationship between community resilience and resilient cities through GI. The study will highlight cases of communities that failed or raised during pandemic, concluding in a set of lessons and recommendations for the development of community resiliency within urban environments.
