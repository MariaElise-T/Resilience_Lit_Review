AbstractThe aim of this investigation was to present a status of Dioscorea species inventory, looking at abundance, distribution and on‐farm trials to sustain the need for its extraction from the forest by the Abayanda. The study looked at the vulnerability and resilience of Dioscorea species in and around Bwindi Impenetrable forest, south‐western Uganda. The biological association of Dioscorea species in eleven research sites of Nteko, Rubuguri, Nyabwishenya, Buhoma, Mpungu, Mushorero, Kagote, Migyera, Kitariro, Ntendure and Rwanju was ascertained. The success of this study was aided by the collaboration with the indigenous community of pygmies (Abayanda). This entailed the interpretation, description, analysis and identification of the data and voucher specimens of the Dioscorea species encountered in the research area. The study focused on the wild yams, a delicacy among the indigenous Abayanda people of Bwindi and Mgahinga forests presently known as Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP). These two Afromontane forests are known to be rich in plant diversity. The study of Dioscorea species was confined to BINP forest where the numbers of Abayanda are more than those around MGNP and Echuya forest reserves.
