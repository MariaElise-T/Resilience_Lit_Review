The Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory (DRRI) is a widely used instrument for assessing deployment‐related risk and resilience factors among war veterans. A revision of this instrument was recently undertaken to enhance the DRRI's applicability across a variety of deployment‐related circumstances and military subgroups. The resulting suite of 17 distinct DRRI‐2 scales is the product of a multiyear psychometric endeavor that involved (a) focus groups with Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans to inform an assessment of the content validity of original DRRI measures, (b) examination of item and scale characteristics of revised scales in a national sample of 469 OEF/OIF veterans, and (c) administration of refined scales to a second national sample of 1,046 OEF/OIF veterans to confirm their psychometric quality. Both classical test theory and item response theory analytical strategies were applied to inform major revisions, which included updating the coverage of warfare‐related stressors, expanding the assessment of family factors throughout the deployment cycle, and shortening scales. Finalized DRRI‐2 scales demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability and criterion‐related validity. The DRRI‐2 can be applied to examine the role that psychosocial factors play in postdeployment health and inform interventions aimed at reducing risk and enhancing resilience among war veterans.
