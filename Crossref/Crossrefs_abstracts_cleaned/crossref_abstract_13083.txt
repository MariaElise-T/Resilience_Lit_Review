Digital entrepreneurship (DE) refers to the core scopes of the entrepreneur, entrepreneurial process, and ecosystem. Entrepreneur relates to digital behavior patterns, social impact, and knowledge, including the digital entrepreneurial intention of students to start a business. The current research aims to empirically examine personal characteristics covering psychological resilience, subjective well-being, demographic characteristics, and higher education service quality as environmental factors that might impact student’s digital entrepreneurship intention (DEI). A total of 305 responses were collected from undergraduate and graduate students in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, using a questionnaire consisting of four scales distributed online from various fields of study. The validity and reliability of the measurements and hypothesis testing were tested using SmartPLS. The research results show that service quality, student’s subjective well-being, and resilience positively influence their digital entrepreneurship intention. The moderating effect of the period of study on service quality and subjective well-being was rejected, while the moderating effect of gender was supported. However, the moderating effect of the period of study on student resilience was supported, and the moderating effect of gender was rejected. Therefore, universities and policymakers should focus on providing excellent services and support to improve students’ digital entrepreneurship intention and consider gender differences in designing relevant programs.
