AbstractThis study examines the moderating role of employee ambidexterity on how high-performance work systems and employee resilience relates to organisational resilience and employee well-being during crises. Additionally, it explores the influence of organisational resilience on employee well-being during crises. This study used a quantitative approach. Two-wave cross-sectional data were obtained from 324 employees of pharmaceutical manufacturing firms in Ghana and analysed using Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Squares. The findings indicated that a high-performance work system plays a crucial role in enhancing the link between organizational resilience and employee well-being. Although employee resilience was found to influence on organizational resilience and employee well-being positively, this effect is not statistically significant. The results also indicate that the role of exploitation ambidexterity is vital in strengthening the relationship between high-performance work systems, employee resilience, organizational resilience, and employee well-being, particularly during crises. This provides a comprehensive analysis of the influence of high-performance work systems, employee resilience, and employee ambidexterity on both organizational resilience and employee well-being. Additionally, using personal and organisational resources to examine how they promote employee well-being during crises empirically provides new insights into resilience and well-being literature.
