Introduction: This study aims to investigate the effect of positive resilience training on improving emotional self-regulation, psychological distress, and parent-child interactions in mothers of children with intellectual disabilities.
Methods: Data collection tools included Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (1992), Emotion Self-Regulation Questionnaire by Hofmann and Kashdan (2010), and Parent-Child Interaction Questionnaire by Pianta (1994). Positive resilience training was implemented in 8 sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. Data analysis was done using SPSS.v21 software and univariate and multivariate analysis of covariance tests. 30 individuals were selected using purposive sampling method who were randomly assigned to two groups (15 individuals per group).
Results: The results showed that positive resilience training was effective on the overall score of emotional self-regulation and the components of concealment and compromise. In addition, the effectiveness of this intervention on psychological distress had also been significant. Also, the results showed that positive resilience training had a significant effect on general positive relationship and the components of closeness and dependence.
Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it is recommended to prioritize positive resilience training in intervention programs aimed at improving mental health of the mothers of children with intellectual disabilities.
