We study the problem of universal resilience patterns in complex networks against cascading failures. We revise the classical betweenness method and overcome its limitation of quantifying the load in cascading model. Considering that the generated load by all nodes should be equal to the transported one by all edges in the whole network, we propose a new method to quantify the load on an edge and construct a simple cascading model. By attacking the edge with the highest load, we show that, if the flow between two nodes is transported along the shortest paths between them, then the resilience of some networks against cascading failures inversely decreases with the enhancement of the capacity of every edge, i.e. the more capacity is not always better. We also observe the abnormal fluctuation of the additional load that exceeds the capacity of each edge. By a simple graph, we analyze the propagation of cascading failures step by step, and give a reasonable explanation of the abnormal fluctuation of cascading dynamics.
