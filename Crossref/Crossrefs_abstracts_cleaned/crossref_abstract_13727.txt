 Prevention Institute, a nonprofit, national center dedicated to health and well-being, developed a toolkit for health and resilience in vulnerable environments (THRIVE), a community assessment tool, to help communities bolster factors that will improve health outcomes and reduce disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. THRIVE is grounded in research and was developed with input from a national expert panel. It has demonstrated utility in urban, rural, and suburban settings.  Within months of piloting, several communities had initiated farmerâ€™s markets and youth programs. THRIVE provides a framework for community members, coalitions, public health practitioners, and local decisionmakers to identify factors associated with poor health outcomes in communities of color; engage the range of partners needed to improve community health outcomes, such as planners, elected officials, businesses, housing, and transportation; and take action to remedy disparities.
