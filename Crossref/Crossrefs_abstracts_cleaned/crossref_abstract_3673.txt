Several partially edentulous patients are advised extraction of sound teeth as these teeth are inadequate to provide support for a good prosthesis. An overdenture in such cases provides opportunity to preserve the sound teeth and still provide a successful prosthetic rehabilitation. Resilient precision attachments further provide additional advantage of improved retention and stability and their resiliency helps preserving the abutment teeth over a longer period of time. Various techniques are followed to fabricate and incorporate these attachments. This case report describes two partially edentulous patients rehabilitated with tooth supported overdenture by direct and indirect technique respectively.
