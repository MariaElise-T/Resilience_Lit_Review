AbstractObjectiveEating disorder (ED) psychopathology is common among Iranian college students. Resilience (i.e., the ability to bounce back and adapt in the face of adverse and stressful conditions) has been found to be a protective factor against ED psychopathology in the West. However, no research to date has examined resilience as a protective factor against ED psychopathology in Iran. The current study used network analysis to examine an ED and resilience network in an Iranian sample.MethodParticipants were Iranian college students (N = 478) who completed the Farsi‐Eating Disorder Examination‐Questionnaire and Farsi‐Brief Resilience Scale. We estimated a network of ED symptoms and resilience processes and identified central and bridge symptoms.ResultsCentral ED and resilience nodes were discomfort in seeing one's own body, feeling guilty about eating due to shape/weight, and thinking about shape and weight making it difficult to concentrate. Having a hard time making it through stressful events bridged with binge eating and fear of losing control over eating.ConclusionProcesses related to managing stress and binge eating appear to maintain the association between ED symptoms and resilience processes.
