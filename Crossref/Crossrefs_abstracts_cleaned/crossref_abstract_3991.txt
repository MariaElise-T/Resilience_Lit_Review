Various changes that have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic require students to be able to adapt to various academic demands and rise from existing problems, considering that the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing today. This ability is referred to as academic resilience. This study aims to see the picture of academic resilience in students in terms of self-concept and family support. The subjects in this study were students at Bhayangkara University, Jakarta Raya. The sampling technique used in this study is purposive Sampling. The data analysis method used in this research is multiple linear regression analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the effect of two variables X (self-concept and family support) on variable Y (academic resilience). Based on the results of the regression analysis, the value of p = 0.005 or p <0.05 and the value of F = 5,631. That is, self-concept and family support together can predict academic resilience. The results of the analysis can be seen as the value of the coefficient of determination or effective contribution of self-concept variables and family support simultaneously or together can predict the resilience of 10.4%, while the rest is influenced by other factors.
