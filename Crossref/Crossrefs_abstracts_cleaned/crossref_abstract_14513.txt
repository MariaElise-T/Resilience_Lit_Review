Abstract
This paper discusses the plantation techniques and perceptible economic benefits of the Anambra State Government’s distributed Malayan Yellow Dwarf coconut seedlings. Through the distributed seedlings, the government seeks to ensure climate resilience and economic benefits for its people. Data was collected from a cross-section of 384 respondents randomly selected to represent the entire population. The study revealed the recommended planting techniques disseminated as trimming and dressing the seedlings to prepare for planting, ploughing the land to encourage aeration, 6.5 meters apart planting space, and digging a 2-square foot depth, among others. The study also found that 73.2% of the sample is moderately aware of these recommended techniques and that the awareness was determined by gender, educational level, agricultural experience, and household size. The respondents had positive feelings about the investment by the government, and it was recommended that policymakers should intensify efforts to populate the State with high-yielding coconuts that are likely to start producing in the next 3 – 4 years as a way of repositioning the State revenue generation.
