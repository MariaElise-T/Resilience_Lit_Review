Objectives  This study investigates the effects of shared leadership, team efficacy on resilience Clincal nursre.
Methods  Data collection was conducted on 194 Clincal nursre from April 10 to April 30, 2023, at P city and the responses to the questionnaire were analyzed by descriptive analysis, t-test, One-way ANOVA, Pearson's corre-lation coefficient, and Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis.
Results  As results of this study, shared leadership scored 3.91 out of 5, Team efficacy 3.84 out of 5 and Resilience 3.60 out of 5. Shared leadership was significantly higher the position (F=3.644, p<.05) and Team efficacy was higher with more clinical experience (F=2.683, p<).05), the higher the position, the higher it was(F=3.234, p<.05). The resilience of the older you are (F=4.626, p<.05), the higher the clinical career (F=3.811, p<.01), and the higher the position, the higher the position, the higher the clinical career(F=5.284, p<.01). Clinical nurses' of resilience was correlated with shared leadership (r=.393, p<.001)and there was a correlation with team efficacy (r=.582, p<.001). More clinical experience (β=.364, p<.01), had an effect on team efficacy is resilient (β=.608, p<.001) and explaining 40.6% of the variance(F=12.522, p<.001). In other words, it was results show that the resilience of clin-ical nurses increased were associated with enhanced as the clinical experience, the team efficacy.
Conclusions  Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that management measures such as the de-velopment and application of programs to improve resilience of clinical nurse are needed.
