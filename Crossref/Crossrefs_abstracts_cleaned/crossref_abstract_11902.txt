AbstractThis paper is aimed to analyze the existing relationships and controlling functions between the urban green infrastructures on the resilience of the urban sprawl. The analysis begins questioning whether urban sprawl sustainable growth can be controlled after achieving urban supported by urban green infrastructure. The analytic method used is based on developing a conceptual and theoretical framework of reference to review the literature on the main variables of the research: Green infrastructure, resilience, and urban sprawl. It is concluded that while it is difficult to find linear causality in a direct relationship among the variables of the analysis, it is supported by the existence of more holistic connectivity leading to the controlling of the urban sprawl. The analysis suggests that a holistic approach is required to build urban resilience based on green infrastructure by addressing a fuller range of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban spectrum of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban sprawl.
