AbstractThe study explored the influence of tourism IT adoption and risk management orientation on tourism supply chain agility and resilience that may impact sustainable tourism supply chain performance using dynamic capability view. The study gathered 302 perceptual responses from hotels and tour companies and analyzed using structural equation modeling in AMOS. The study also evaluated for invariance of the proposed model across hotels and tour companies. Furthermore, it also explored if tourism IT adoption and risk management orientation moderates the relationship among agility, resilience and sustainable tourism supply chain performance. Implications for theory and tourism managers were provided.
