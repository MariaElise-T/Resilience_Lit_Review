Despite growing attention to resilience in supply chain literature, the lack of a parsimonious conceptualization of supply chain resilience highlighting its multidimensional structure has hampered progress in empirical research. This study utilizes both the dynamic capabilities perspective in the conceptualization of supply chain resilience. The dynamic capabilities perspective is utilized to posit agility and visibility as reflective dimensions of resilience, while the SCOR perspective demonstrates that supply chain resilience as the combined effect of resilience achieved in sourcing, manufacturing and distribution processes. Thus, the resulting framework presents a comprehensive systems-based view of supply chain resilience that is very parsimonious.
