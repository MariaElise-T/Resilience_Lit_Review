Introduction: Resilience is an element that promotes the psychological well-being of people displaced by violence. The quality of life related to health focuses on an individual’s assessment of their quality of life, which becomes essential in evaluating health outcomes in the displaced population. Methodology: This is a qualitative study with a narrative-interpretive design that aims to understand the factors that generate psychological resilience and some connotations or perceptions of quality of life in a group of older adults displaced by violence in Colombia that belong to a support program called “income generation”. Results: Living conditions, such as physical and social-spiritual well-being, affected the groups’ quality of life. Resilience processes favour coping and tolerance to conditions of social vulnerability caused by displacement. Conclusions: The phenomena that help explain psychological resilience in the participants mainly correspond to individual differences, with self-perception of competence, positive perspectives, and projection towards the future as the factors that most boldly explain the resilience characteristics of older adults.
