Resilience is a dynamic and multidimensional construct that refers to
                        the ability of people to cope with or recover successfully from adverse
                        situations. The aim of this study was to analyze resilience in workers and
                        residents of a Centre for the Elderly institutionalized according to
                        sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age and marital status) after the
                        adverse situation caused by an earthquake in Lorca in May 2011. A
                        sociodemographic questionnaire developed ad hoc and the adaptation of the
                        Resilience Scale Connor-Davidson (CD-RISC) were administered. Participants
                        were 20 workers and 34 seniors in a Centre for the Elderly institutionalized
                        in the Region of Murcia (Lorca). The average age of the institutionalized
                        seniors was 81 years with a standard deviation of 7.68 and the average age
                        of professional caregivers was 37.85 years with a standard deviation of
                        9.60. The study allows to determine resilience capacity in response to
                        sociodemographic characteristics and the existence of significant mean
                        differences between the ability of tenacity-efficacy among workers and
                        residents of the Centre for the Elderly. This will allow to design actions
                        to prevent and/or intervene promptly.
