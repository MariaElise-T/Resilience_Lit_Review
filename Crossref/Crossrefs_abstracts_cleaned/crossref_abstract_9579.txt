Abstract
Sleep disturbance is a significant sleep health problem among caregivers of persons with dementia and could exacerbate numerous adverse health outcomes. Resilience is one’s ability to recover from challenges and is a protective factor that is posited to blunt the effect of caregiving stress on sleep disturbance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine if resilience moderates the association between perceived role overload and sleep disturbance using data from the 2017 wave of the National Study of Caregiving. The sample consisted of 480 informal caregivers (mean age = 61.77 years, SD = 13.69 years) of persons with dementia in the U.S. Participants completed self-report questionnaires about their sociodemographic and health characteristics, perceived role overload, resilience (i.e., adjusting to change and recovering from hardship), and sleep disturbance (i.e., frequency of trouble maintaining sleep). Data were analyzed using multiple regression with interaction terms to evaluate the moderation effect of resilience. Higher perceived role overload was associated with higher sleep disturbance, while controlling for caregivers’ age, race, gender, education, and self-rated health. The association of perceived role overload with sleep disturbance was attenuated among caregivers with higher levels of resilience (b = -.029, 95% CI: -.058, -.001). This study highlights the stress-buffering and sleep health benefits of resilience in the context of dementia caregiving. Among caregivers of persons with dementia, approaches to improve their ability to recover, resist, and rebound during caregiving challenges may mitigate stress and optimize their sleep health.
