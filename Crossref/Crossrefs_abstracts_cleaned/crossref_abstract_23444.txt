 Objective: ADHD is associated with elevated rates of comorbid depressive disorders, yet the nature and development of this comorbidity remain understudied. We hypothesized that a longer period of prior ADHD treatment, being less likely to engage in maladaptive cognitive/behavioral coping strategies, and less severe ADHD symptoms would predict greater likelihood of lifetime resilience to depression. Method: Seventy-seven adults with ADHD completed diagnostic interviews, clinician-administered symptom rating scales, a stressful life events measure, and self-report questionnaires. We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with resilience to depression. Results: Adults with more extensive ADHD treatment histories were more likely to be resilient to depression. Those who were less likely to report ruminative thinking patterns and cognitive-behavioral avoidance were also more resilient. Severity of current or childhood ADHD symptoms and recent negative life events did not predict resilience. Conclusion: Results identify protective factors that may promote the resiliency to ADHD-depression comorbidity.
