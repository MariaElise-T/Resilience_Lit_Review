The development process of urbanization has changed the natural factors such as topography, geomorphology, and bit difference, which increases the risk of urban storm flooding in case of extreme weather. The concept of urban resilience can guide urban planning and construction to resist rain and flood disasters and improve urban rain and flood safety resilience capacity. In order to effectively assess the level of urban rain and flood resilience, and effectively tap the key impact factors of resilience, this project takes Bengbu City as an example, and analyzes the urban infrastructure construction, economic and social development, urban ecological environment and hydrological situation of Bengbu City in recent years, constructs a comprehensive assessment model of urban rain and flood resilience, obtains the level of rain and flood safety resilience and key constraints in Bengbu City, and looks for optimization of the management of urban flooding, and find the effective implementation path to optimize the management of urban flooding.
