Abstract Although resilience is a relevant construct, there are no Brazilian instruments available to identify the resilient potential in children. Considering this, an instrument called Children’s Resilience Markers was developed. The study included 500 children from five different groups, aged 8 to 12. Through ANOVA, it was possible to notice that Children’s Resilience Markers was able to differentiate groups that presented higher resilience abilities. Children’s Resilience Markers presented good validity evidences. However, other studies must be carried out in order to reach a greater understanding of its psychometric characteristics.
