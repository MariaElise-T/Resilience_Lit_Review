Abstract
First of all, a field survey is carried out on the commercial space in the cold region, and a comparative analysis is made on the spatial design contents of commercial blocks in terms of regional location plane layout, traffic organization, spatial form and other aspects. Secondly, this paper analyzes the existing problems in resilient urban construction in the four aspects of overall design, space handling, block shape and environment design in commercial space planning and design. Basis on this, the space design countermeasures are proposed to enhance the adaptability and diversity of the space environment, enhance the redundancy of design and regionalization, strengthen the robustness and resilience of commercial space, and strengthen the intelligence and the ability of learning and transformation of the space environment.
