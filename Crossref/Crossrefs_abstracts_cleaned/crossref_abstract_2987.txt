 Repeated-load triaxial tests were conducted on crushed granitic base-course material to study the resilient response under different stress paths and compaction states. It has been established that the resilient response of this prestrained unbound granular material is best defined in terms of tangent stiffness (Et) and vertical stress (σv). The data also revealed the existence of a threshold value of tangent stiffness that is essentially dependent on initial confining stress for a given compaction state. When the tangent modulus exceeds this threshold value, a unique relationship between tangent stiffness and vertical stress exists for mobilized shear resistance ratios less than 0.4. This Et–σv relationship is independent of stress path. A simple power law model can be used to predict the resilient response of unbound base-course material and an approximate value of resilient modulus for any desired stress path and initial stress condition. The use of the tangent stiffness – vertical stress model for pavement design appears to be very promising.Key words: granular, material, resilient modulus, triaxial, stress path.
