AbstractThis study evaluates the conceptual and metrical correspondence between the construct measurements of the individual Competitive Productivity model and the scale that measures individual resilience in tourism. An individual work resilience scale was adapted to the context of the tourism industry. Scale items were operationalised on an online survey (n = 425) with tourism professionals and students. The role of age as an influence variable on individual resilience levels was explored. The results point to correspondences between the scale designed to measure personal resilience and the construct that identifies the ICP components. The findings suggest that companies should prioritise diversity in their recruitment policies, which allows them to capitalise on integrative thinking to become more ambidextrous, and consequently, more resilient.
