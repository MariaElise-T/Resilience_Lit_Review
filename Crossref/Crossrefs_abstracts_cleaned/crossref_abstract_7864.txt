Abstract
Background
Population aging is a pervasive phenomenon occurring rapidly worldwide, while sustainable development goals are considered the mental health among older adults.

Methods
To investigate the factors affecting mental health, we conducted a scoping review of the 47 papers published between 2015 and 2022 to explore various dimensions affecting older adults’ mental health.

Results
Our finding mirrors four dimensions of creating healthy and sustainable environments for older adults: person, place, processes, and resilience-related health in the living environment. The person dimension includes individual characteristics, attitudes and behaviors, and health status. The place dimension is divided into five categories: land use, access, physical form, public open spaces, and housing, while the process consists of the social, cultural, and economic environments. Resilience-related health dimension emphasizes the impact of natural and man-made disasters on older people’s mental health.

Discussion
These findings can provide policymakers insights into developing community-based environmental intervention strategies to promote mental health among older adults and support healthy and active aging.
