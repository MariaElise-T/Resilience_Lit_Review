Transformational Leadership as an essential component of organizations plays highly supportive role in sustaining organizationsâ€™ performance during disastrous conditions through development of organizational resilience. The research study investigates the effect of transformational leadership on organizational resilience with an intervening role of organizational learning as mediator. The study being quantitative exploration involves primary data collection from managerial level employees working in NGOs operating in Lahore, Pakistan, using survey questionnaire. The results of the study lead to conclude that transformational leadership has a direct positive effect on development of resilient NGOs, but the indirect effect, involving organizational learning as mediator, is insignificant. Therefore, under crisis contingencies, transformational leaders tend to support individuals and organizations in order to respond and recover from losses, through motivation, inspiration and provision of strong vision rather than promoting learning and enhancing intellectual resources of the organizational members.
