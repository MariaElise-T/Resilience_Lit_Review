AbstractThe coronavirus pandemic has exposed healthcare professionals to suffering and stressful working conditions. The aim of this study was to analyze professional quality of life among healthcare professionals and its relationship with empathy, resilience, and self‐compassion during the COVID‐19 crisis in Spain. A cross‐sectional study was conducted with 506 healthcare professionals, who participated by completing an online questionnaire. A descriptive correlational analysis was performed. A multivariate regression analysis and a decision tree were used to identify the variables associated with professional quality of life. Empathy, resilience, and mindfulness were the main predictors of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout, respectively.
