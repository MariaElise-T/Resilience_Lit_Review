This research analyzes the factors that affect resilience after natural disasters of 997 households in rural areas of Vietnam in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 by using logistic regression. The research results show that factors such as receiving timely warnings related to natural disasters, not taking measures to respond to natural disasters, and putting trust in the community will improve resilience after natural disasters. If the household head is of Kinh ethnicity and participates in community organizations, the response capacity whenever a disaster occurs is higher, and vice versa. Additionally, household heads not responding to natural disasters, instead receiving support from their relatives and friends and borrowing capital positively affect resilience capacity after one year since the disaster. In cases where Kinh women are household heads and join social communities, the resilience capacity after one year also increases. Besides, the research suggests some solutions to develop resilience capacity, which focus on the relationship between characteristics of households, household heads, and disaster response with the resilience capacity of rural households in Vietnam. Finally, this research proposes some suitable policies to improve resilience capacity in Vietnamese rural areas.
