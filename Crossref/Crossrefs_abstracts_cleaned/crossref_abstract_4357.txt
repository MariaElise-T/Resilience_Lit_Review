A polyurethane elastomer was microbiologically evaluated in vitro for its potential use in resilient denture liners. Specimens were immersed in suspensions of ten selected oral microorganisms; this was followed by viable cell counts at intervals during a 16-week period. Results indicated that the polyurethane neither supported the growth of the organisms nor was it degraded.
