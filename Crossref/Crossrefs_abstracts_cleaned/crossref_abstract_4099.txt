Executives and academics have presented the idea of Industry 5.0, which is an attempt to build upon the previous iteration, Industry 4.0, by including many important tenets such as human-centricity, resilience, and sustainability. Because of the significance of this idea, the current study provides a decision-making framework to examine a responsive supply chain dubbed responsive supply chain 5.0 for healthcare systems. This framework takes into consideration the aspects of Industry 5.0. In order to do this, at the onset, the most important connected factors and strategies are determined by consulting the relevant experts and body of published research. This problem has been considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Initially, the DEMATEL method was used to assess and prioritize the main criteria and their sub-indicators. Secondly, the CRADIS method was used to evaluate and rank the strategies used to make the supply chain more responsive. The results indicate that the collaboration and sharing of information strategy is the most appropriate strategy if applied.
