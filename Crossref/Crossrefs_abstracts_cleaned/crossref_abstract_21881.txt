The purpose of this study is to analyze the mediator effect of ego resilience in relation to parental neglect and depression of drop-out adolescents. A total of 318 drop-out adolescents were used for analysis, correlation analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to verify the relation of measure variables and mediator effect. According to the results of the analysis, the higher the level of parental neglect, the lower the level of ego resilience, and the higher the level of depression. It has also been confirmed that ego resilience has a partial mediator effect in the relationship between parental neglect and depression in drop-out adolescents. The findings suggest that ego resilience needs to be addressed in approaching the depression problem experienced from drop-out adolescents. In particular, if the level of depression is high due to parental neglect, it is suggested that strengthening internal capabilities by focusing on improving ego resilience will be an effective intervention in reducing depression.
