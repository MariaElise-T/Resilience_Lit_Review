Soil microorganisms are key drivers of soil biochemical processes, but the resilience of microbial communities and their metabolic activity after an extreme environmental change is still largely unknown. We studied structural (bacterial and fungal communities) and functional responses (soil respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, hydrolase activities involved in the mineralization of organic C, N, P and S, and microbial community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs)) during the microbial recolonization of three heat-sterilized forest soils followed by cross- or self-reinoculation and incubation for 1, 7 and 30 days. Soil ATP content, biochemical activities and CLPP were annihilated by autoclaving, whereas most of the hydrolase activities were reduced to varying extents depending on the soil and enzyme activity considered. During the incubation period, the combination of self- and cross-reinoculation of different sterilized soils produced rapid dynamic changes in enzymatic activity as well as in microbial structure and catabolic activity. Physicochemical properties of the original soils exerted a major influence in shaping soil functional diversity, while reinoculation of sterilized soils promoted faster and greater changes in bacterial community structure than in fungal communities, varying with incubation period and soil type. Our results also confirmed the importance of microbial richness in determining soil resilience under severe disturbances. In particular, the new microbial communities detected in the treated soils revealed the occurrence of taxa which were not detected in the original soils. This result confirmed that rare microbial taxa rather than the dominant ones may be the major drivers of soil functionality and resilience.
