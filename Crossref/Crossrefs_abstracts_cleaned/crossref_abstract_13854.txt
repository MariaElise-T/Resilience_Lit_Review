When encountering crisis events, systems, organizations, and people must react and handle these unpredictable events. Under these circumstances, important social functions and infrastructures must be restored or adapted as quickly as possible. This capacity refers to resilience. Although considerable research has been conducted on the resilience of infrastructure systems over the past years, a critical review of these studies remains lacking. Therefore, this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by presenting a comprehensive review of infrastructure research conducted in the past decade, namely, from 2011 to 2021. On the basis of a systematic search, this study identified 222 journal articles investigating infrastructure resilience. A review of the identified papers revealed five research streams in the area of infrastructure resilience (IR), namely, the assessment of infrastructure resilience, improvement of infrastructure resilience, conceptualizing infrastructure resilience from various perspectives, factors influencing infrastructure resilience, and the prediction of infrastructure resilience. This study also presented some directions that future research can pursue. These directions include analyzing factors influencing infrastructure resilience based on simulation, assessing the resilience of green infrastructure, improving the resilience of interdependent infrastructure, and predicting the resilience of infrastructure based on empirical research.
