ABSTRACTObjectiveThe current study aimed to test parasympathetic nervous system activity, indexed through resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as a resilience factor that moderates the associations between socioeconomic status (SES), circulating cytokines, and somatic health in children.MethodsThe sample included 181 parent-child dyads (mean [standard deviation] child age = 9.91 [0.57] years; 50.3% boys). Parents reported on family income, parental education, and subjective social status, to index SES. Children provided serum samples for assaying circulating inflammatory cytokines and had RSA measured during a 5-minute seated resting period. We used a composite measure of inflammation that combined standardized measures of interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor α. Parents reported on their child’s global health impairment and number of chronic health conditions.ResultsLower SES was associated with poorer global health, and higher levels of inflammation were associated with poorer global health, but these associations were not significant among children with high resting RSA. Specifically, resting RSA moderated the association between SES and global health impairment (B= 0.09, standard error [SE] = 0.02,p< .001). Preliminary evidence suggests that resting RSA may also moderate the association between inflammation and global health impairment (B =−0.12, SE = 0.03,p< .001), although this effect was no longer significant after Winsorizing an outlier value of a child with high global health impairment (B =−0.06, SE = 0.03,p= .04).ConclusionsHigh resting RSA may represent a physiological profile of resilience in children, weakening the associations between low SES and poor somatic health, and between greater inflammation and poor somatic health.
