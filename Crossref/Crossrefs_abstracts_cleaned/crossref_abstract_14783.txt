Knowledge employees&#39; innovation performance, as an important factor in maintaining a firm&#39;s competitive advantage, assumes a critical role in firm development, and existing research has confirmed that managerial leadership style has a significant impact on it. Based on social exchange theory and social cognitive theory, a mediated effect model of being moderated is constructed. Using 552 knowledge employees as research subjects, empirical analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression and process test, and the findings revealed that: platform leadership has a significant positive predictive effect on innovation performance of knowledge employees; organizational resilience is an important process mechanism between platform leadership and innovation performance of knowledge employees; the direct contribution of platform leadership to innovation performance of knowledge employees and organizational resilience in The mediating role between the two is moderated by innovation self-efficacy. The results of the study provide useful implications for how firms can leverage leadership effectiveness to cope with crises and enhance the innovation performance of knowledge employees.
