Abstract
The aim of this study is to present criteria to evaluate the resilience of sewer networks related to ground collapse and urban flooding likely to occur in a specific region and then to determine the ranks of the sewer networks resilience of the selected regions to show the applicability of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enriching Evaluations (PROMETHEE II) method. Fourteen evaluation criteria representing resistance, reliability, redundancy, and response and recovery are presented and their weights are estimated by the AHP by asking questionnaires to 10 sewer experts, leading to the result that the sub-criteria of reliability showed the highest importance, followed by the length ratio of good pipelines (under resistance) and adequacy of the flow capacity of the bypass pipelines (under redundancy). Four separate small blocks of drainage areas (total area of 3.57 km2; sewer length of 50.6 km) in Seoul are chosen for the case study. Using appropriate preference functions and thresholds for each evaluation criterion for PROMETHEE II application yields the resilience rankings of four blocks as Block III &gt; Block IV &gt; Block I &gt; Block II. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out by changing the weights.
