The article is based on the learning outcomes of a sensitization session held with students enrolled in eleven universities of the twin cities under a project titled Sensitization of Youth for Socially Resilient Communities in the Digitalizing World. The objectives were to sensitize youth for safe digital behaviour, spread the message of respecting human values, personal space, and privacy in digital communication, communicate the harassment policy concerns, and promote the emerging normative order for respecting cultural diversity and harmony for self-actualization behavioural change. Around 500 students directly participated in online and in-person sessions. The findings are based on the post-session assessment results recorded from 374 responses. The project outcome reflects a better understanding of the notion of privacy, personal space, cyber-bullying, cyber-crimes, online sexual assaults, types & legislation against harassment through a US-Pakistan diplomatic soft intervention and initiative for Pakistani youth.
