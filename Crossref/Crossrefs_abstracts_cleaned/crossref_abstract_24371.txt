Background
Recent estimates suggest around 14% of 11–16 years in England have a
                     mental health problem. However, we know very little about the extent and nature
                     of mental health problems among diverse groups in densely populated inner
                     cities, where contexts and experiences may differ from the national
                     average.


Aims
To estimate the extent and nature of mental health problems in inner city
                     London, overall and by social group, using data from our school-based
                     accelerated cohort study of adolescent mental health, Resilience, Ethnicity and
                     AdolesCent Mental Health.


Methods
Self-report data on mental health (general mental health, depression,
                     anxiety, self-harm) were analysed (n, 4353; 11–14 years, 85% minority ethnic
                     groups). Mixed models were used to estimate weighted prevalences and adjusted
                     risks of each type of problem, overall and by gender, cohort, ethnic group and
                     free school meals (FSM) status.


Results
The weighted prevalence of mental health problems was 18.6% (95% CI 16.4%
                     to 20.8%). Each type of mental health problem was more common among girls
                     compared with boys (adjusted risk ratios: mental health problems, 1.33, 95% CI
                     1.18 to 1.48; depression, 1.52, 1.30 to 1.73; anxiety, 2.09, 1.58 to 2.59,
                     self-harm, 1.40, 1.06 to 1.75). Gender differences were more pronounced in
                     older cohorts compared with the youngest. Mental health problems (1.28, 1.05 to
                     1.51) and self-harm (1.29, 1.02 to 1.56)—but not depression or anxiety—were
                     more common among those receiving (vs not receiving) FSM. There were many
                     similarities, with some variations, by ethnic group.


Conclusions
Adolescent mental health problems and self-harm are common in inner city
                     London. Gender differences in mental health problems may emerge during early
                     adolescence.
