This review addresses major questions about divorce, around which much contemporary research is oriented. These involve questions of the consequences of divorce for the adjustment of children and the vulnerability and resiliency of children in coping with divorce, whether children are better off in a conflictual intact family situation or a divorced family, and how mothers, fathers, and clinical or educational interventions can moderate the effects of divorce. Although research in the past decade has yielded considerable information about these questions, issues that need further investigation are also presented.
