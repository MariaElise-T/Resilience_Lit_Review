Abstract

Objectives
Examine and analyze the resilience levels of first and second semester BSN students in order to check for significant increases and decreases in resilience levels and factors.


Methods
Resilience levels were collected using the Connor Davidson CD-RISC-25 tool in both first and second semester students.


Results
No significant increases in resilience from first to second semester were noted, as anticipated. Several key areas showed significant decrease.


Conclusion
Resilience levels do not necessarily increase from one semester to the next; however, several significant decreases in levels did occur, suggesting a need for a resilience training module in the nursing program.
