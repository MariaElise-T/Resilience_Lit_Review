AbstractUncovering the mechanisms that lead to Amazon forest resilience variations is crucial to predict the impact of future climatic and anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we apply a previously used empirical resilience metrics, lag‐1 month temporal autocorrelation (TAC), to vegetation optical depth data in C‐band (a good proxy of the whole canopy water content) in order to explore how forest resilience variations are impacted by human disturbances and environmental drivers in the Brazilian Amazon. We found that human disturbances significantly increase the risk of critical transitions, and that the median TAC value is ~2.4 times higher in human‐disturbed forests than that in intact forests, suggesting a much lower resilience in disturbed forests. Additionally, human‐disturbed forests are less resilient to land surface heat stress and atmospheric water stress than intact forests. Among human‐disturbed forests, forests with a more closed and thicker canopy structure, which is linked to a higher forest cover and a lower disturbance fraction, are comparably more resilient. These results further emphasize the urgent need to limit deforestation and degradation through policy intervention to maintain the resilience of the Amazon rainforests.
