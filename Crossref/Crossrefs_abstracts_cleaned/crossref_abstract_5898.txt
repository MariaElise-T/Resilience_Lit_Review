This article has two purposes. The first is to show the role that urban gardening can play in building city resilience to various negative impacts resulting from changes in the economic and social spheres and connection with global warming. The second goal is to investigate whether Polish cities use urban gardening to strengthen the resilience of socio-economic systems to climate change. Resilience is understood as the capacity of a city to respond to a perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly. It concerns both social and technical infrastructure, including blue and green infrastructure. Worldwide, the usage of urban gardening to strengthen cities' resilience to climate change is becoming more and more common. Polish cities have yet to join this positive trend.
