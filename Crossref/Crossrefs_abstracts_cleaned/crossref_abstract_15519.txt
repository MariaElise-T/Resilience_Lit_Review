Objectives Do support and coping strategies moderate the link between stress and life satisfaction among grandparent caregivers? Background Grandparents raising grandchildren often experience stress, which may compromise their subjective well-being. Thus, it is important to understand the role of support and coping as protective or promotive factors in relation to grandparent caregivers’ resilience (i.e., life satisfaction). Methods Grandparent caregivers ( N = 74) reported their daily hassles, life satisfaction, social support, and coping. Results These grandparent caregivers are a vulnerable population in terms of stress and limited social support and coping. Structural equation modeling supported direct, promotive effects of social support and coping on life satisfaction, but not moderation. Conclusion Despite high levels of stress, half of the grandparent caregivers were satisfied with their lives, which was explained by their social support and coping skills. Some grandparents who assume this role likely would benefit from interventions that promote social support and coping skills.
