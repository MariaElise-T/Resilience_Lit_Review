AbstractHydrologic resilience modeling is used in public watershed management to assess watershed ability to supply life-supporting ecoservices under extreme climatic and environmental conditions. Literature surveys criticize resilience models for failing to capture watershed dynamics and undergo adequate testing. Both shortcomings compromise their ability to provide management options reliably protecting water security under real-world conditions. We formulate an empirical protocol to establish real-world correspondence. The protocol applies empirical nonlinear dynamics to reconstruct hydrologic dynamics from watershed records, and analyze the response of reconstructed dynamics to extreme regional climatic conditions. We devise an AI-based early-warning system to forecast (out-of-sample) reconstructed hydrologic resilience dynamics. Application to the La Tejer√≠a (Spain) experimental watershed finds it to be a low dimensional nonlinear deterministic dynamic system responding to internal stressors by irregularly oscillating along a watershed attractor. Reconstructed and forecasted hydrologic resilience behavior faithfully captures monthly wet-cold/dry-warm weather patterns characterizing the Mediterranean region.
