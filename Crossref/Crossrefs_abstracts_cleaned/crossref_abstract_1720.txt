There has been much recent discussions on the issue of proper installation of resilient channels. Of particular concern is the issue of the “shorting out” of the resilient channels, wherein the gypsum board attachment screws passes through the resilient channel and into the structural member. This paper will present the test results obtained during a series of tests to evaluate the significance of this issue. In addition data will be presented from a further study on the significance of the geometry of the resilient channel design.
