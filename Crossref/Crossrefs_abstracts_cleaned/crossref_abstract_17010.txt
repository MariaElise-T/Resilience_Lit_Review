PurposeWhile resilience is seen as fundamental to recovery and rehabilitation processes within the psychology discipline, (Bonanno, 2004), it has received little acknowledgement throughout speech pathology literature. Research suggests that targeting the malleable components associated with the recruitment and development of resilience has the potential to optimize acquired brain injury (ABI) rehabilitation outcomes. This article examines key constructs fundamental to understanding resilience and provides examples of existing evidence-based practices that can be feasibly incorporated into existing neurorehabilitation practices to drive the establishment of resilience.MethodArticles describing resilience models and frameworks were examined to identify resilience factors that could be fostered during neurorehabilitation therapy sessions.ResultsThe literature supports a series of common traits across resilience intervention models that enhance the development of resilience including the promotion of optimism, motivation, self-efficacy, and interpersonal connectedness. We describe a number of established communication strategies and counseling techniques that promote these resilience factors and can be integrated into rehabilitation therapy sessions.ConclusionsSpeech pathologists should consider resilience as a primary and essential clinical ingredient in their rehabilitation interventions. It is important that clinicians are trained in the communication and counseling skills that comprise these ingredients. Bolstering resilience while addressing rehabilitation targets can optimize clinical outcomes.
