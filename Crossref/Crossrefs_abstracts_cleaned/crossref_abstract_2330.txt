New Zealandâ€™s agricultural pastures contain significant soil carbon (C) stocks that are susceptible to change when impacted by management and natural processes (e.g., climate). Inputs of C to these pastoral soils is through photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric CO2 either on-site or elsewhere. Changes in soil C stocks are in response to the management of the system that alters the input-output balance. Increasing the resilience of pastures to climatic events such as hot and dry summers or cool and wet winters can increase inputs of C to the soil while sustaining above-ground production and so provide an opportunity for C sequestration. Furthermore, increased pasture for grazing can reduce the need for management practices identified as detrimental for soil C stocks such as irrigation or the production of cropped supplemental feed. A reduction in the need for renewal and its associated soil C losses, and the establishment of a more diverse sward, especially if deeper-rooting species are included, has the potential for increasing soil C stocks provided the diversity can be maintained. From a soil C perspective, a resilient pasture maximises CO2 uptake to ensure adequate above- and below-ground inputs to maintain or increase soil C stocks and minimise the need for management activities detrimental to soil C.
