AbstractThis study aimed to assess the relationship between health locus control, resilience and self‐efficacy in older adults with psychiatric disorders. This study was conducted using a cross‐sectional design. Sample: A purposive sample of 291 older adults receiving psychiatric outpatient care at Alabbasya Hospital for Mental Health in Cairo was recruited for this study. The data were collected by the following tools: sociodemographic data sheet, the multidimensional health locus of control scale, the general self‐efficacy scale, the brief resilience scale and the general health questionnaire. The study participants reported low levels of health locus of control, low levels of self‐efficacy and normal levels of resilience. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between resilience and general self‐efficacy. The study concluded that older people with psychiatric disorders reported low levels of health locus of control and self‐efficacy, while they experienced normal resilience levels. There was a strong positive correlation between resilience and general self‐efficacy among the study participants. The results of this study can guide healthcare professionals in developing tailored interventions and support programs to improve this population's quality of life and overall mental health outcomes.
