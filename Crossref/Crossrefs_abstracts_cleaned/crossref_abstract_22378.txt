Background This study aims to investigate the factors shaping resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic among people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods A total of 341 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. The online survey included scales of resilience, depression & anxiety, loneliness, social support, COVID-19 fear, stress, and sociodemographic information. Results Logistic regression test results showed loneliness (OR = 2.548, 95% CI = 1.251, 5.189), social support (OR = 2.217, 95% CI = 1.148, 4.279), income (OR = 2.581, 95% CI = 1.217, 5.472), sexual orientation (OR = 2.707, 95% CI = 1.004, 7.300), age (OR = 1.044, 95% CI = 1.006, 1.083) and COVID-19 fear (OR = 0.891, 95% CI = 0.840, 0.944) were statistically significant factors associated with resilience among PLWH. Conclusion In conclusion, reducing COVID-19 fear by providing the correct information about the COVID-19 pandemic, fortifying the level of social support satisfaction, as well as minimising the level of loneliness have the potential to improve psychological resilience among PLWH.
