Abstract
Climate-resilient buildings in Palestine can play an important role in a more sustainable residential building sector. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of adopting architectural design strategies and material technologies from vernacular architecture to create a new climate-resilient building. The paper targets single houses as these represent the majority of residential buildings in suburban and rural areas, and are similar to the vernacular architecture in size and functionality. The EDSL Tas simulation tool was used to assess the thermal performance and energy savings in the proposed model compared with traditional houses and modern typical houses, in two different climatic zones. The proposed climate-resilient house has materials and design strategies derived from vernacular architecture, in addition to the use of thermal insulation. The results show that the proposed house is more climate-resilient compared to modern houses. In cold winter and hot summer climates, the proposed model presents a total annual heating and cooling energy consumption of 59% less than typical modern houses, and 5% more than old buildings. In hot arid summer and warm winter climates, the proposed house presents a total annual heating and cooling energy consumption of 58% less than a modern typical house and 8% more than the traditional house.
