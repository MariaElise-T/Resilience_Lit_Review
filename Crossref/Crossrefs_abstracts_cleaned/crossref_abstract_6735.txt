Â The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has undergone a remarkable change and is now a formidable economic player. Changes in the market and other external circumstances have made it impossible to fully take advantage of this progress. This research delves into the concept of strategic resilience in the context of ASEAN, with a focus on strategies for responding to dynamic markets and settings. The research confirms that a high level of strategic resilience is necessary to overcome the challenges of regional economic integration. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) has promoted commerce among its members but has also raised issues of economic inequality and over-dependence on certain sectors. Adaptable business models and diversification strategies are essential in this environment for facilitating innovation and mitigating the effects of economic volatility. Strategic resilience in the area comprises climatic adaptability and environmental sustainability in addition to economic stability. Policies that encourage disaster preparation and sustainable resource management are especially important in ASEAN given the region's vulnerability to natural catastrophes and climate change. This research also emphasizes the significance of corporate culture and adaptive leadership in fostering creativity and flexibility. It is believed that cooperation within ASEAN and worldwide alliances contribute to strategic resilience. By sharing knowledge and experience, member states may strengthen their capacity to withstand shocks and boost stability in the area as a whole. The research concludes that strategic resilience requires not just predicting but also actively shaping shocks.
