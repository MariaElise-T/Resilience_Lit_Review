Nanostructure of Resilience Orthodontic bonding solutions, an orthodontic adhesive that is mostly used nowadays in the orthodontic practice, is analyzed in the paper. After determining the adhesive properties, a correlation was established between the nanostructure of tested adhesive and the tooth bracket bond strength. Based on AFM images of the analyzed adhesive, by way of correlations of arithmetic means of debonding force (I) and average adhesive roughnesses (Ra, Rq, Rzijs, Rz) we come to a conclusion that by increasing the average adhesive roughnesses, increases the debonding force too (I). After that we compared the obtained results with the other adhesives that are also most commonly used. It was observed that with all the roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rzijs and Rq) the strongest bond was achieved with Resilience Orthodontic bonding solutions, followed by Heliosit, Orthodontic (Ivoclar, Vivadent), GC Fuji Ortho LC, while the weakest bond was with ConTec LC âˆ’ Dentarum. Higher roughness of Resilience Orthodontic bonding solutions at the nano level is most probably due to a bigger number of thorns which penetrate into micro cavities developed under the action of acids. Higher roughness is a consequence of the chemical structure itself of the composite material.
