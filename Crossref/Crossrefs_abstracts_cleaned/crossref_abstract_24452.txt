 The COVID-19 global pandemic has had psychological consequences worldwide. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of concerns about contagion on negative affect (NA) according to resilience, gender and age by using a longitudinal methodology that evaluated the participants 4â€‰months before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the resulting lockdown situation imposed by the Spanish government. About 102 participants from a community sample were assessed. The results revealed higher levels of NA during the lockdown, as well as a positive relationship between age and the increase in NA. In addition, we found that a positive relationship between contagion concern and increase in NA was only observed in women with low resilience.
