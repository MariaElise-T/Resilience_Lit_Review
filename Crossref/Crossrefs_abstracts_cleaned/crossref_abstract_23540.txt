Abstract

Background
The operational definition of resilience is elusive and resilient people are difficult to identify. We used self-reported “major health event” (srMHE) to identify resilience and evaluate the functional and mortality trajectories associated with this condition.


Method
We selected from the InCHIANTI study persons aged 65 or older who could perform the Short Physical Performance Battery at baseline and attended the 3 years follow-up visit. We identified 4 groups: Controls: no srMHE and no decline in physical function; Decliners: no srMHE and decline in physical function; Resilient: srMHE and no decline in physical function; and Non-resilient: srMHE and decline in physical function. Linear mixed models and Cox regression were used to analyze changes in activities of daily living (ADL) score over 9- and 10-year mortality across groups, respectively.


Results
The 313 participants that reported a srMHE had worse perceived health status and higher number of GP visits and prescribed drugs at baseline. Of these, 78 were Resilient and 235 Non-resilient; of the remaining, 136 were Controls and 277 Decliners. Compared to the Controls, Resilient had similar change of ADL score over time (β: −.03, p = .92) and mortality (hazard ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.76–2.23), while Decliners and Non-resilient showed significantly higher mortality and, the latter, worsening of ADL score. Additional srMHE during follow-up affected the rate of change of ADL score and mortality more in the Controls group than in the Resilient group.


Conclusions
A srMHE along with repeated evaluation of physical function may be used to identify resilience in older people, and may complement the standard functional evaluation of geriatric patients.
