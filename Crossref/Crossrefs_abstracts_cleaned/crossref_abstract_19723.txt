The structural performance of shield tunnel structures is highly susceptible to degradation under complex environmental loads, with the most common manifestation being bolt preload loss. In this study, a shield tunnel numerical simulation model was established to analyze the seismic response of shield tunnels with varying degrees of bolt preload loss. Firstly, the deformation patterns of shield tunnel structures under seismic loads were analyzed. Subsequently, ellipticity and joint opening were selected as seismic resilience assessment indicators based on the mechanical response. A seismic resilience assessment model was then established, including three states: normal state, affected state, and recovered state. The results show a direct relationship between the recovery capacity of tunnel structures and the initial performance of the lining structure, as well as the magnitude of the load. The lower the degree of structure degradation, the greater the structural recovery capacity. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between residual deformation and the initial performance loss of shield tunnel structures, as well as the intensity of seismic loads. This study contributes to enriching the theoretical framework for the seismic resilience assessment of shield tunnels, which have significant implications and provide valuable references for engineering safety.
