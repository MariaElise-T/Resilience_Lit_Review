In this study, 20 nursing families were interviewed with a focus on the integration of family care needs and employment. The predominantly female cohort of nurses revealed considerable career change, employment breaks and the use of part‐time and casual work options as they worked to manage and integrate family care responsibilities with employment opportunities. Here, drawing on the stories of two particular respondents, I use Trentmann's notion of ‘disruption as normal’ to explore these shifts and reformations of family and career, arguing that multiple changes and reconfigurations of routine are not necessarily signs of fraying careers or fracturing family lives, but can be understood as an adaptive and resilient response to the everyday nature of disruption and the consistency of family change.
