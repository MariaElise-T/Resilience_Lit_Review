COVID-19 has posed a significantly severe impact on both peopleâ€™s lives and the global economic development. Increasing the community epidemic resilience will considerably improve the national public health emergency response capacity from bottom to top. This study identifies the influencing factors of community epidemic resilience through systematic literature review under the 4R framework, then obtains the relationships of influencing factors through Interpretive structural model, and finally assesses the performance of epidemic resilience using PROMETHEE II method through empirical cases in Nanjing, China. The results show that: (1) Eight factors influencing the epidemic resilience of community are identified, and the economic level plays the root role; (2) Community epidemic resilience can be improved from robustness, rapidity, redundancy and resourcefulness aspects; (3) Through the empirical analysis, the epidemic resilience ranking of community can be displayed (Community D > T > S > F); (4) Additionally, the performance and sensitivity analysis of influencing factors in each community can be demonstrated. (5) Finally, four implications are proposed, namely, allocating public resources rationally, significantly increasing the economic level, ensuring the accuracy of information delivery and conducting disaster learning.
