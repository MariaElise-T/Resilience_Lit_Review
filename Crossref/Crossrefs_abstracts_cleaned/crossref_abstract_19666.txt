Introduction Previous studies have shown correlations between adult attachment, stress-coping, and resilience, but little is known about how attachment and stress-coping affect resilience, particularly among first-generation immigrants. This study explored relationships among adult attachment, stress-coping, and resilience for first-generation immigrants. Method A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to assess associations between adult attachment and stress-coping with resilience among first-generation immigrants. Thirty-five participants answered an online Qualtrics survey. A simple linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze the results. Results The results indicated statistically significant correlations between avoidance scores and annual household income but not between resilience and education, resilience and income, and stress-coping scores and education and income. Positive reinterpretation growth was positively correlated with resilience, while denial and behavioral disengagement were negatively correlated. Adult attachment and number of years in the United States were not significantly statistically related to resilience. Conclusion The findings indicate high income may be associated with attachment avoidance, and increases in positive coping strategies and decreases in negative coping strategies are associated with resilience among first-generation immigrants. Understanding influences on first-generation immigrants to engage in stress-coping skills may inform the development and implementation of occupational therapy, including programs and interventions for successful client-centered outcomes.
