ABSTRACT Objective to analyze the relationship between resilience and associated factors (stress, minor psychiatric disorders and quality of life) of family caregivers with children and adolescents undergoing cancer treatment. Method mixed methods research, with sequential explanatory strategy, carried out with family caregivers of children and adolescents undergoing cancer treatment in a public hospital in the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Data collection took place from February to September 2018. The quantitative study was cross-sectional in nature, and the qualitative research was descriptive-exploratory. Participants included 62 family caregivers in the quantitative stage and 16 responded to semi-structured interviews. An instrument containing sociodemographic, economic, labor, health and resilience scales (CD-RISC-10-Br), minor psychiatric disorders (MPDs) (SRQ-20), quality of life (QOL) (WHOQO-Bref) and stress and semi-structured interview were applied. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data. Results family caregivers had a moderate level of resilience (48.4%); high level of perceived stress (41%); suspicion for MPDs (45%). They presented satisfaction in the physical Qol domains (67.7%); psychological (62.9%); personal relationships (61.3%), and dissatisfaction in the environment domain (75.8%). The interviews reported for health changes that could trigger MPD, stress and changes in quality of life. Conclusion high level of stress; suspicion for MPD and low QoL, with the environment, were evidenced as associated factors for a lower level of resilience of family caregivers. The need to develop actions that strengthen resilience was percieved, as caregivers were essential for the effectiveness of the care plan for children and adolescents undergoing cancer treatment.
