AbstractThis paper investigates the problem of resilient vector consensus for a group of dynamic agents against mobile malicious attacks. As real networks often operate under random environment and noises, we approach this problem by considering general random dynamic networks with weighted directed topologies. We propose three types of mobile attack models, which differ in the timing of moving of attackers and the capability of detecting such moving. By employing distributed discrete-time algorithms, the Lyapunov theory and martingale convergence theorem, resilient vector consensus is shown to be reached for all three models when the underlying network satisfies certain stochastic robustness conditions.
