AbstractIn 2020, COVID-19 forced global education online. Especially in developing countries, this change presented a challenge for those with limited access to devices and reliable electricity and Internet. Whilst some students struggled to adapt, others thrived with eLearning. This paper explores the experiences of one group of students who succeeded in overcoming not only the restrictions of COVID-19, but also significant political instability. The group has a mix of 1st year and 2nd year students in a pre-university program. The 2nd-year students in particular are noteworthy as despite the adversity faced, they have now successfully transitioned to university studies. Drawing on Bronfenbrenner’s (The ecology of human development: experiments by nature and design, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1979) socio-ecological framework, the data from twelve semi-structured interviews was analysed and inductively coded. The findings outline how personal goal orientation, coping mechanisms acquired in previous adverse situations, and a desire to serve their communities combine with external influences from families and communities and basic need fulfilment to enable the students to persevere and thrive. The implication is that as students draw on previous experiences, these five core concepts should be incorporated into general education to build the students’ capacity for resilience.
