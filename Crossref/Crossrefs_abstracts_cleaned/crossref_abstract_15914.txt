AbstractWe show a quasi‐irreversible shutdown (hysteresis) of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in an unfluxadjusted global climate model with an eddy‐permitting ocean. This global climate model is a prototype of one submitted to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and is the most comprehensive model to show this behavior. The AMOC has a resilience timescale for a given hosing: If the hosing exceeds the critical hosing for collapse for only a limited time, the AMOC recovers when the hosing is stopped. Beyond the critical time, when the hosing stops the AMOC stays in a weak state with no recovery within 200 years. We show that simple, observable metrics such as AMOC strength and mixed layer depth can indicate whether this critical resilience time has passed and that the mechanism controlling the presence of recovery is a positive advective feedback.
