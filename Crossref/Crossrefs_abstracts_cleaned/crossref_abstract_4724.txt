Older gay men and lesbians are at greater risk for depression due to a lifetime of sexual minority stress (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2013). For gay men and lesbians, depression is associated with aggression and relationship problems (Bernards & Graham, 2013). However, aggression may foster resilience if aggression is expressed in a healthy, nonviolent manner that motivates a person to take positive action towards a greater purpose (Russell & Richards, 2003). What are the relationships between aggression and resilience with depression in a sample of older gay men and lesbians; and do group differences exist? Data was collected from (N=50; Older gay men) and (N=50; Older lesbian women). SPSS 20 was used to run a multivariate analysis to test our overall model. Through a minority stress lens (Meyer, 1998), this study hypothesizes resilience moderates the relationship between aggression and depression. Significant differences between older gay men and older lesbiansâ€™ aggression, resilience, and depression scores exist. For the older gay men and lesbian combined group, a moderation analysis indicated that in addition to aggression and resilience being single significantly predicted depression accounting for approximately 57% of the variance in depression. Furthermore, resilience significantly moderated the relationship between aggression and depression in the model in the sample (N = 100) of older gay men and lesbians.
