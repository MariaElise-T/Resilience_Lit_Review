Research in preterm birth has focused on the disparate outcomes for Black, Hispanic, and Latina women as compared with White women. However, research studies have not focused on centering these women in frameworks that discuss how resilience is embodied. This article is a presentation of our transdisciplinary contextual framework of resilience, building on work that centers Black, Hispanic, and Latina women, as well as historical oppression and trauma resilience frameworks developed by transcultural psychiatry, psychology, public health, anthropology, medicine, nursing, sociology, and social work. To develop the model, we reviewed 115 articles and books (1977â€“2019), which were then evaluated and synthesized to develop a transdisciplinary framework of contextualized resilience to enable a better understanding of the complex interplay of medical and social conditions influencing preterm birth. The framework includes multiple ecological layers that cross the individual, familial and intimate, community, structural, policy and law, and hegemonic domains.
