Within an integrated planning approach, urban streams are a valuable natural resource with strategic significance for creating resilient cities. This paper explores the revitalization of small urban streams within sustainable development practices, and discusses the manifold benefits that it brings about. Best practice examples are presented to illustrate how watercourse revitalization improves flood mitigation and stormwater treatment, strengthens urban ecology, diversifies recreation options, and enhances visual appeal of the waterfront. These experiences are used to establish urban planning and design guidelines for revitalization of small streams in the City of Ni≈°. The results of this study should help with both setting up policy framework and implementation in planning practice.
