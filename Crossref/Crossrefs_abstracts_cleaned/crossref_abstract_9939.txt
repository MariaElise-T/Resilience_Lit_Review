 The demand for recycled material as the unbound base course in roadway construction has increased in recent decades because of the excellent mechanical properties of the recycled base course and inherent life-cycle benefits. However, concerns have been expressed about postconstruction changes in the resilient modulus (Mr) caused by moisture variation. This study investigated the relationship of Mr to soil matric suction (ψ) at an in-service stress state for recycled asphalt pavement, recycled pavement material, and recycled concrete aggregate compared with crushed limestone as a conventional base course control. Resilient modulus tests were conducted in accordance with NCHRP Project 1–28A Procedure 1a. Equipment modifications allowed for an applied ψ ranging from 1.5 kPa to 65 kPa during testing. A proposed model incorporated parameters from the soil–water characteristic curve to predict a summary resilient modulus (SRM), that is, the in-service Mr at a representative field stress state. The SRM increased with increasing ψ for all compacted base courses studied. An SRM ratio, defined as the ratio of the SRM at a particular ψ to the as-compacted SRM at optimum water content, was empirically quantified. The modulus ratio increased linearly with logarithmic ψ for the studied recycled and natural aggregates. The findings indicate that the Mr–ψ relationship is highly relevant for predicting in-service performance of pavement layers.
