American Indians and Alaska Natives suffer disproportionately from poverty and other inequities and are vulnerable to adverse health and socioeconomic effects of COVID-19. Using surveys and interviews (May–July 2020), we examined urban American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents’ (N=50) health and behaviors, family dynamics, community cohesion, and traditional practice participation during COVID-19. About 20% of teens reported clinically significant anxiety and depression, 25% reported food insecurity, and 40% reported poor sleep. Teens also reported high family and community cohesion, and many engaged in traditional practices during this time. Although many teens reported problems, they also emphasized resilience strategies.
