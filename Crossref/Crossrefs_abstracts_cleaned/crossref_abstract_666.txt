AbstractThe aim of this paper was to critically evaluate the Resilience Scale (RS). The RS is a standardized 25-item self-report assessment tool that measures the degree of individual resilience focusing on positive psychological characteristics instead of deficits. Participants are required to rate, using a 7-point Likert item, how much they agree or disagree with the statements and how much they identify with them; higher scores reflect higher levels of resilience. The test authors suggest that five dimensions underpin the RS: equanimity, perseverance, meaningfulness, self-reliance, and existential aloneness, and the scale loads onto two factors described as personal competence and acceptance of self and life. However, there is little empirical support for the conceptual framework. The tool has been translated and validated in several languages as well as administered to over 3 million people around the world in 150 countries, making it the most widely used resilience measure. Nevertheless, there are questions with regards to the underlying construct and content validity, since the proposed theoretical constructs underpinning the scale are open to debate. Despite its popularity and apparent reliability, there are potential difficulties with the measure which are presented here. Finally, it is suggested that the scale would benefit from further examination of the underlying constructs which contribute to resilience.
