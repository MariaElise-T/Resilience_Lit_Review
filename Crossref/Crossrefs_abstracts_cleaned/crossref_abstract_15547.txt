Realizing the building of urban resilience and improving urban resilience has become important contents of urban development. In view of this phenomenon, relying on the framework of trio spaces, which includes physical space, societal space, and cyberspace, the evaluation index system of urban resilience is established. The evaluation model of urban resilience is constructed by using CRITIC-entropy weight and the cloud evaluation method. Four sub-provincial cities in Northeast China, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Dalian, are selected as the analysis objects, and the resilience of each city is comprehensively evaluated and spatially evaluated. From the urban resilience comprehensive evaluation, this paper found the cities with the highest resilience levels in 2014, from 2015 to 2018, and from 2019 to 2020 are Dalian, Changchun, and Shenyang, respectively. The city with the lowest resilience level is Harbin. Although there are differences in resilience evaluation values of four cities, the resilience levels of these cities are all “qualified”. From the urban resilience sub-space evaluation, this paper explored the shortcomings of the resilience of physical space, societal space, and cyberspace of each city through the comparison. Then, some suggestions about highlighting the enhancement of cyberspace resilience, emphasizing resilience-building balance, conducting resilience evaluation, and monitoring regularly, and local government policy support are proposed to help to promote urban resilience from the concept of trio spaces.
