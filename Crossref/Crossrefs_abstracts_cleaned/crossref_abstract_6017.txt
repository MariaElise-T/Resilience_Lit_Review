Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is an increasing concern in India and it adversely affects the mental health and interpersonal relationships of the families. This research aims to study and assess the mental health of the families of concerned individual and establish the need for more attention and care towards this population. The present study was an attempt to find how coping influences anxiety, depression and resilience among the family members of substance use disorder. Adults ranging from the age of 18 years and above who are family members of SUD diagnosed individuals were taken for the study. The total sample of the study consisted of 100 adults out of which 50 were from Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu and remaining 50 from various other states. Three scales namely, DASS, BRIEF-COPE and Resilience scale was used for data collection on four variables. Results showed that coping style adapted by the family member impacts the psychological wellbeing of that individual. Similarly, it showed that avoidance coping is associated with anxiety and depression. However, there was no gender difference in anxiety, depression, coping and resilience in family members in relation to the SUD of another member in their family.
