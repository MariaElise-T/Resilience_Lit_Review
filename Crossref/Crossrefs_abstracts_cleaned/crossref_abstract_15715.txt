Emergency following the COVID-19 pandemic has forced educational institutions in over 190 countries to close, and teachers worldwide worked hard to adapt their curriculum to an online format and face multiple related challenges. The purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on teachersâ€™ performance and verify whether this change may have been justified by individual resilience, self-compassion and awe levels. The respondents perceived a significant drop in performance following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic across all investigated subscales. Preliminary data obtained in this study indicate that this drop may be explained by a link between performance and Awe, Resilience and Self-Compassion.
