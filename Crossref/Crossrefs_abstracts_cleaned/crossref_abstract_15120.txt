Military training programs have been developed to enhance soldier resilience competencies, which are necessary for soldiers to perform their duties effectively under stress. The ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and the experience of previous military missions abroad emphasize the need for effective training that helps soldiers recover quickly and continue their missions. However, selecting the most suitable resilience training program is challenging and the selection criteria need to be optimized to ensure the most needed competencies are considered. This study aimed to utilize a fuzzy MCDM method to establish the priority weight of decision-making criteria, identifying the core competencies necessary for soldier resilience training, and utilizing the fuzzy TOPSIS method to rank and select the most appropriate training program. The evaluation results were calculated using the MATLAB (R2020b) mathematical package developed by MathWorks. The application of the hierarchical MCDA model based on fuzzy sets theory indicated that mental agility is the most important competence in high-stress environments. The study found that the Mindfulness-Based Mind Fitness Training (MMFT) program, which is intended to regulate soldiersâ€™ emotions, had the highest rank among evaluated options according to the combined FAHP sub-factor fuzzy weights and alternatives evaluation conducted using FTOPSIS. The study provides valuable information on the selection of military resilience training programs.
