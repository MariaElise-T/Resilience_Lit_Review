AbstractObjectiveThe aim of this study is to examine the association between coping strategies, resilience, optimism and different mental health outcomes like stress, anxiety, and depression among the medical residents’ during the COVID‐19 pandemic, with consideration of different factors like seniority, frontliner, gender, and coping style.MethodsAn electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed by the DASS‐21. Professional quality of life was measured by the ProQOL scale. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief‐COPE, and resilience was measured by the Brief Resilience Scale.ResultsThe most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non‐COVID‐19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT‐R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p < .001). Lower avoidant coping scores, higher optimism, and higher resilience were associated with lower stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.ConclusionIt seems that avoidant coping styles can exacerbate depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in medical residents amidst the COVID‐19 pandemic. Strategies promoting optimism, resilience, and approach coping styles can decrease the mental health burden of the pandemic on medical residents.
