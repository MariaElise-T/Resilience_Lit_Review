Introduction:It is critical to understand how gender relations shape women’s and men’s lives to enhance their resilience toward disaster because women and men have different roles, responsibilities, and access to resources. Unequal participation between women and men in a disaster risk reduction program will influence how each can be affected by various hazards, and how they will cope with and recover from disaster. Even though women are often considered to have incredible resilience and capacity to survive in the face of disasters, they also experience a range of gender-specific vulnerabilities.Aim:This study aims to evaluate women’s participation in current efforts of the Disaster-Resilient Village Program and to develop a conceptual framework for implementing gender-based a disaster resilience program at the community level.Methods:This study employed a mixed-method approach and adopted several major activities including literature review, interview, focus group discussion, and a questionnaire survey with a total of 300 respondents. Three selected villages in Aceh Besar District, Aceh Province, were the study area of this study.Results:By using descriptive and inferential statistics, this study proposed a gender-based framework for implementing Disaster-Resilient Village Program.Discussion:This framework contributes to the emerging literature on gender-based disaster risk reduction and may assist policymakers in formulating regulations related to the community-based disaster risk management program. On the practical front, this study provided indicators to practitioners regarding some conditions that should be taken into account when mainstreaming gender in community-based disaster risk management programs. This study offered an original contribution to the existing bodies of knowledge on gender studies in disaster risk reduction efforts.
