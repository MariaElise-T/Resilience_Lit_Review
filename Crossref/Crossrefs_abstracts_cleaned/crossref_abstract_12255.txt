Abstract

Objectives:
Resilience can be defined as the capacity to overcome stressful situations, such as menopausal transition. Female sexual dysfunction is a problem that prevents women from experiencing satisfaction from sexual activity. In this study, we assessed resilience, sexual function, and quality of life among a sample of mid-aged Spanish menopausal women.


Methods:
This cross-sectional study was performed in 101 symptomatic menopausal women. Participants filled out the 14-item Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale, the 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the 16-item Cervantes-SF form, and a sociodemographic questionnaire.


Results:
Resilience scores were significantly higher among women with high sexual function scores (FSFI > 26), with a 14-item Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale total valuation of 86 [80-94] versus 74 [66-79.50] (P<0.001). Sexual function was significantly worse in the low resilience subgroup of participants, with an FSFI total score of 18.90 [14.10-24] versus 29.40 [24.60-33] in the mid-high resilience one (P<0.001). Menopauserelated quality of life was significantly worse among low resilient women, with a Cervantes-SF total score of 42.50 [34.17-56.70] versus 30.80 [20.80-44.90] in the mid-high resilience one (P = 0.004).


Conclusions:
In our sample, resilience was related to sexual health. Higher resilience scores seem to be linked to a better quality of life during the menopausal transition.
