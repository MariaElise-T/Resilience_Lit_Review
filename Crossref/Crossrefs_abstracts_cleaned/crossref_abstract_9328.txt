Background Resilience has been considered a key personal characteristic for a healthcare professional to be able to cope with the demands of their profession. There is a paucity of research that has considered resilience in midwifery and none has used a resilience scale over the length of the midwifery programme. Methods A resilience scale was used with one cohort of student midwives on five occasions throughout their midwifery programme. Results The mean across all of the five scale scores for the 15 participants was 122 (range of mean scores:92â€“135). The majority of participants (n=13) had average, moderate or moderately high resilience and all student midwives except one increased their resilience between the first and fifth completion of the scale. Conclusions The true resilience scale is a useful tool to use in midwifery undergraduate programmes to determine the development of resilience in student midwives. Importantly, the scale could be used at an early opportunity to identify any support needs.
