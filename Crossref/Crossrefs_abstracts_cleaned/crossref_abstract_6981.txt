Small, private, non-profit liberal arts universities with professional schools face threats that differ from those of large, public, and private institutions. These include threats such as low brand recognition outside a small geographic area, changes in the natural environment, and lower business school enrollments which reduce income from tuition. The University of Redlands responded to these threats by merging with a small institution in a different market and by adding a major in sustainable business and adding online delivery to its MBA program. These changes both built on the existing capacity for change and added new sources of resilience. They hired and developed leaders and followers with resilient traits and values. They built organizational cultures, identities, and character that could support resilience and positive change. They built a network of positive stakeholder relationships with diverse groups. Finally, they instituted teams, plans, and other resources that enabled agility.
