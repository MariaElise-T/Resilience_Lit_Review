Increased complexity of economic, social and technological systems cause that crises, uncertainty and risk have become an integral part of modern world. Undoubtedly, today’s organizations face the necessity of dealing with a growing number of various risk factors-generators: disasters, sudden bankruptcies of key participants of supply chain, loss of reputation, highly innovative products/technologies entering the market or risk resulting from introducing new legal regulations (Gorzeń-Mitka, 2015). Thus, U.Beck’s statement that the 21st century can be described as the century of risk seems right (Beck, 2009).Operation of companies in the current environment requires effective trade-offs among economic, environmental and social outcomes while maintaining the longevity of organizational efficiency (Eltantawy, 2016). For example, Maslaric et al. (2013) indicate that, modern trends in new business models, which assume a strive for continuous improvement in efficiency by cutting costs and reducing waste in every supply chain processes, create a new risk perspective. In this situation, striving to achieve balance between organizational efficiency and organizational resilience is more than a necessity. This has caused seeking for new approaches to protect value and results of our activities. One of them is creation of resilience. According Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary word "resilience" has two meanings: the ability of people or things to feel better quickly after something unpleasant and the ability of a substance to return to its original shape after it has been bent, stretched or (Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 2016).
