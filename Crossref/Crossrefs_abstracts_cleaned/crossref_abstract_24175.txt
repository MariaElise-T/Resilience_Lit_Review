Recently organizations such as enterprises, governments and nonprofit organizations have been increasingly demanded to develop a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS). For developing a BCMS, it is indispensable to grasp the current state of the organization concerned quantitatively, but no effective method for such quantitative evaluation has been established. This paper presents one example of the evaluation indexes, focusing on organizationâ€™s vulnerability and resilience to disruptions. And by introducing the prototype of self-rating form adopting the evaluation indexes, this paper attempts to make the current state of the organization concerned on them more graspable. The objective of this study lies in promotion of evaluation of the current state of organizations and continuous improvement of preparedness for the possible disruptions in order to realize the more resilient organization.
