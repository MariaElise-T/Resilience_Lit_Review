AbstractCyber–physical distribution systems with renewable energy should have high resilience under extreme conditions. However, in a distribution system with deep cyber–physical coupling, the propagation of information risk impairs the resilience of the system. This paper proposes a strategy to improve the resilience of cyber–physical distribution systems that considers cross‐space propagation of information risk. First, the mechanism for interaction between the cyber space and physical space is analyzed, and an information risk cross‐space propagation model is proposed. Second, the risk status of key device nodes is quantified according to the risk propagation model, and an optimization strategy for information risk control is obtained, whose objective function is the minimum risk of the coupling network. Third, a fault restoration strategy that considers cyber space risk is proposed. Finally, the paper reports experiments using the modified IEEE 33‐node and 123‐node distribution networks to simulate the proposed strategy and verify its effectiveness.
