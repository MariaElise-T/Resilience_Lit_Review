This study investigated the existence of resilience resource factors that may promote language maintenance in a Batak community whose language is critically endangered. Drawn from Chandler and Lalonde’s (1998) concept of cultural resilience, Olsson et al.’s resilience resources model (2003), and Landweer’s (2002) indicators of language use, interview and observation data from twenty-five children were collected and analyzed within ten months. Data were validated from interviews and focus-group discussions with parents, local leaders, and teachers in the community. Findings showed that:  (1) the individual’s developed language, strong identity with the Batak community and their self-efficacy, malleability, and flexibility are the resilience resources at the individual level ; (2) cohesion and care within the family, strong use of Batak language at home and being a non-blaming family are the resilience resources at the family level; and (3) positive teacher influences in Batak language maintenance, being a non-punitive community and the consistent use of the Batak language within the community on a day to day interactions are the resilience resources at the community level. The enumerated are strong language resilience resource factors promoting language resilience among young Batak speakers.
