The better adaptation and mitigation options can help to curtail the effects of climate change on livestock performance. To reduce poverty and promote sustainable development through livestock production, favorable policies and action-oriented research are urgently required to address the pertinent issue. For effective adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change and livestock production, these measures should be scaled up through policy. For example, understanding farmersâ€™ perceptions and including them in policy development can improve food security and environmental conservation by promoting widespread practice adoption. In addition, a comprehensive view of costs, time, and effort required from the producer need to be included to the policy framework to maintain sustainable and resilient production systems.
