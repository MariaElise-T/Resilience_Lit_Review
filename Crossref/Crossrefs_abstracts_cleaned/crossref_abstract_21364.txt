The traditional inhabitants of the Amazon settled on the banks of the several rivers and streams that  cut  through  the  forest,  and  from  there  they  take  their  daily  livelihood  through  hunting,  fishing  and  handicrafts made from the materials found around them. The actions of protection, preservation, care and conservation  are  imperative  to  guarantee  the  survival  of  the  place.  Especially  when  disruptive  events  affect the local balance, such as the effects of climate change or the economic and health crises, such as the COVID pandemic19. By restricting the movement of people to avoid contagion and the spread of the disease,  it  also  restricted  the  spectrum  of  daily  activities  for  a  good  portion  of  the  population,  which  caused  disruption  in  the  system.  Based  on  semi-open  interview  techniques  and  direct  observation  of  economic  entrepreneurs,  the  São  João  do  Lago  do  Tupé  riverside  community,  located  in  the  Tupé  Development  Reserve,  Manaus,  Amazonas,  the  study  aims  to  analyze  the  perception  of  the  vulnerability  of  these  enterprises  in  the  market,  finance,  organization  and  cooperation  dimensions  and  assess  the  state of resilience in the face of the adverse conditions that may reach them.
