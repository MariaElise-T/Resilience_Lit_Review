            Older adults, who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), exhibit less stress and greater well-being than their younger peers. However, there have been no in-depth explorations of adaptive coping strategies among this population, nor has the role of frailty status been addressed. The current study examined stress and coping in 30 U.S. older adults (mean age = 81 years, range = 68 to 95 years) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering themes of: (1)
            Pandemic Stresses
            : stresses experienced during the pandemic centered around social isolation and concern for others' well-being; (2)
            Resilience
            : older adults proved highly adaptable, with lifetime experience as a stress buffer; and (3)
            Silver Linings
            : older adults reported positive by-products, such as reconnecting with and a renewed appreciation for life and nature. Motivation for change and change itself centered around creating value and meaning in the present, especially around social isolation. Findings challenge existing ageist stereotypes, give insight into interventional design, and highlight the importance of ensuring infrastructural and societal support. [
