There could be many empirical contexts which could be applied in urban resilience. The general objective of this research is to assess urban expansion and its implication on urban resilience in regio-metropolitan cities in the Amhara Region (Gondar and Bahir Dar). It used mixed research approaches and cross-sectional design. Data were collected from primary and secondary sources. Primary data were collected from a survey questionnaire, key informant interview and FGDs while secondary data were gathered from both published and unpublished sources. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to determine sample size, and a proportional sampling method was used. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, percentage, SD), while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results indicate that major factors that influence building urban resilience are lacking proper urban planning, basic infrastructure and good governance in both cities, and both cities are extremely far behind in implementing urban resilience principles. Hence, the study improves the community participation in development policy formulation and implementation for urban resilience.
