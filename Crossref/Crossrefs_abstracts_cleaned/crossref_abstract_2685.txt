(1) Background: Resilience enables individuals to develop positive coping strategies when faced with adversity. However, knowledge on resilience in stroke patients remains limited, and resilience assessment methods continue to be debated. (2) Aim: To perform a concept analysis of resilience in stroke patients. (3) Methods: The Walker and Avant approach to concept analysis was adopted. Searches were performed in the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Chinese Electronic Periodical Services (CEPS) databases and grey literature using the keywords “stroke patient”, “resilience”, and “concept analysis”. (4) Results: The defining attributes of resilience in stroke patients were classified into internal personality traits and external environmental support. Antecedents included physical, mental, and familial and social impairments caused by the disease, and the consequences were good adaptation, which included active cooperation with rehabilitation activities, positive thinking, goal setting, and harboring hope for the future. (5) Conclusion: Resilience is of a diverse and complex nature. Optimism and positivity, problem-solving ability, and familial and social support may assist in re-adjusting or restoring the balance between physical and mental health when a stroke patient faces adversity. Key factors affecting resilience in stroke patients should be further investigated in future research to assist in the development of effective interventional treatment measures.
