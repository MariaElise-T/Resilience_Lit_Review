With the widespread application of supply chain management ideas in the construction field, supply chain resilience as a tool for risk management has also begun to attract scholarsâ€™ attention. The prefabricated building supply chain (PBSC) is greatly affected by internal and external risks in China. This paper constructs a conceptual model of the factors affecting the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain from the perspective of resilience management. Based on 202 valid questionnaires, it makes an empirical study on the above conceptual model by using the method of the structural equation model (SEM). The results show that the production and assembly construction of components have a significant impact on the resilience of supply chain of prefabricated buildings (PB), while the process of transportation and storage of components has no significant impact on it. In addition, the study also verified that information factors and partnership factors have a strong regulatory effect on these three processes. In theory, it provides a new perspective for the supply chain management of prefabricated buildings. In practice, it provides a decision-making basis and scientific guidance for the enterprises in the supply chain of prefabricated buildings in China.
