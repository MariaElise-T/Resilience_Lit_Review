Background Upper limb (UL) impairment in stroke survivors is both multifactorial and heterogeneous. Stratification of motor function helps identify the most sensitive and appropriate assessments, which in turn aids the design of effective and individualized rehabilitation strategies. We previously developed a stratification method combining the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) and Box and Block Test (BBT) to stratify poststroke UL motor function. Objective To investigate the resilience of the stratification method in a larger cohort and establish its appropriateness for clinical practice by investigating limitations of the GPT completion time. Methods Post hoc analysis of motor function for 96 community-dwelling participants with stroke (n = 68 male, 28 female, age 60.8 ± 14 years, 24.4 ± 36.6 months poststroke) was performed using the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (F-M), BBT, and GPT. Hypothesis-free and hypothesis-based hierarchical cluster analyses were conducted to determine the resilience of the stratification method. Results The hypothesis-based analysis identified the same functional groupings as the hypothesis-free analysis: low (n = 32), moderate (n = 26), and high motor function (n = 38), with 3 exceptions. Thirty-three of the 38 participants with fine manual dexterity completed the GPT in ≤5 minutes. The remaining 5 participants took 6 to 25 minutes to place all 25 pegs but used alternative movement strategies to complete the test. The GPT time restriction changed the functional profile of the moderate and high motor function groups leading to more misclassifications. Conclusion The stratification method unambiguously classifies participants by UL motor function. While the inclusion of a 5-minute cutoff time for the GPT is preferred for clinical practice, it is not recommended for stratification purposes.
