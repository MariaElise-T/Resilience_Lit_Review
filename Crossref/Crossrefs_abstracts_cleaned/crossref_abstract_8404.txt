IntroductionStress and burnout are clearly problems for mental health workers. In this paper, we present data from research study on moderators of burnout in mental health staff.Objectives/aimsThe purpose of this study was to explore the phenomenon of resilience as experienced by Russian mental health clinicians working in a highly demanding, specialized and stressful environment (e.g., staff shortages, health service shortages, not being notified of changes before they occurred).MethodsThe study used a range of self report questionnaires. Measures included a demographic checklist, the Hardiness Survey (Maddi 1984), and the GCOS – The General Causality Orientation Scale (Deci & Ryan 1985). The participants for this study were drawn from Medico-rehabilitation Unit, Psychiatric hospital, – the disciplines of psychiatry, clinical psychology and nursing. In all, 10 ward based mental health professionals were surveyed.ResultsThis paper outlines the results of these measures. This in turn allows us to develop intervention strategy to ensure an effective provision, which depends on satisfied professionals, who have a sense of ownership over what they do and an ability to shape the direction of their endeavours.ConclusionsThe study's findings have the potential to inform organizations in mental health to promote resilience in clinicians, to deliver stress management interventions for staff with the potential to reduce the risk of burnout and hence staff attrition, staff retention and mental health.Disclosure of interestThe authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.
