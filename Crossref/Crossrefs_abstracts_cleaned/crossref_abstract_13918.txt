AbstractResilience has become an attractive proposition in many organisations seeking to perform well under adversity and uncertainty in a dynamic and changing operational environment. We developed a survey tool to measure organisational resilience and implemented it in several large training establishments. The gap between the training organisations' actual and desired resilience was identified through analysis of the survey's quantitative responses. The survey's qualitative (free‐form) responses underwent inductive (thematic) and deductive (resilience attribute allocation) analysis to expand our understanding of training establishment problems and possible solutions from the survey participants' perspectives. Here we applied the House of Quality (HOQ) approach to prioritise the solutions to the organisational issues identified from the qualitative responses to align those with the organisational resilience attributes' priorities. The organisational resilience attributes were prioritised in another round of HOQ application to align them with the importance scores of the organisation‐specific resilience requirements. We used the results from our two HOQ rounds to create an optimal path (response) to move from actual to desired organisational resilience, demonstrated in a survey‐based resilience case study conducted in a large Defence training establishment.
