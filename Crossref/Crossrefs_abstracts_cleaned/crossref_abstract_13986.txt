The phenomenon of forced migration due to the war in Ukraine generated enormous flows of population that moved to European countries and therefore also to Romania. A particularly complex and constantly evolving social phenomenon - the problem of refugees - is only at the beginning of sociological and social assistance investigations. In this article, we intended to detail the situation of Ukrainian refugees from a small sample selected in the north of Romania following three axes of analysis: the refugees' perception of their situation, the identification of the factors that contribute to the development of the refugees' resilience and the evaluation of the perception of the humanitarian aid received since leaving the country of origin by refugees. Exploratory research (undertaken as part of a master's thesis) can be a good start for wider research carried out in several areas in Romania where the reception and assistance of war refugees is in full swing.
