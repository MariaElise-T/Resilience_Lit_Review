AbstractWe aimed to examine the subtype classification characteristics of depressive symptoms in Shidu parents (SDPs, parents who have lost their only child) and their associations with resilience and coping styles. The sample comprised 182 SDPs (Mean age = 59.93 ± 7.41 years, 61.5% females). Latent profile analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Three subgroups of depressive symptoms in SDPs were identified: the depression and pessimism group (38.4%), the low depression symptoms group (30.8%), and the well‐adapted group (30.8%). The low depression symptoms group had a lower education level and higher family monthly income than the depression and pessimism group. The low depression symptoms group and the well‐adapted group scored significantly higher in resilience, and lower in negative coping style than the depression and pessimism group. The results highlighted that target intervention is needed for SDPs with high education levels, low family monthly income, high negative coping style, and low resilience in the depression and pessimism group.
