The synergistic improvement in urban resilience and low-carbon development level is significant for mitigating and adapting to climate change, achieving the ‘dual carbon goal’ and promoting sustainable urban development. By constructing a comprehensive evaluation index system of urban resilience and low-carbon development, this study quantitatively measures the level of urban resilience and low-carbon development of the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration (CPUA) from 2009 to 2021. Further, the coupling coordination degree model and geographical detector explore the spatial and temporal evolution pattern and driving factors of the coupling and coordination (CCD) of urban resilience and low-carbon development. The results show the following: (1) From 2009 to 2021, urban resilience shows a good momentum of continuous rise, and the spatial distribution pattern is ‘high in the northeast and low in southwest’. Low-carbon development is characterized by the development trend of ‘first decline and then rise’, forming a spatial distribution pattern of ‘high in the south and low in the northwest’. (2) The CCD also shows a rising development trend. The type of coupling and coordination is mainly reluctant coordination. (3) The CCD shows a significant spatial correlation, and the degree of spatial agglomeration shows a downward trend. (4) The level of economic development and the level of scientific and technological innovation are the main two driving forces for the spatial differentiation of the coordinated development of the two systems. In addition, the explanatory power of the interaction of various influencing factors was significantly enhanced. In a word, this study was helpful to clarify further the spatial interaction between urban resilience and low-carbon development and also to provide experience and reference for low-carbon resilience construction and high-quality development of other urban agglomerations in the world.
