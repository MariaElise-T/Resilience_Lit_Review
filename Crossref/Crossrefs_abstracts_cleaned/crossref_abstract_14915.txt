Low‐density polyethylene (LDPE)/polyethylene–octylene elastomer (POE) foams with different composition ratios (POE, cross‐linking agent, and blowing agent) were produced by using the continuous cross‐linking and foaming process to improve the rebound resilience of chemical cross‐linked LDPE foams. The effects of POE, cross‐linking agent, and foaming agent on rebound resilience of LDPE/POE foams were investigated by using a rebound test, cross‐linking degree experiment, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. Results show that the rebound resilience of LDPE was improved by increasing the flexibility of cell walls and the cell density and decreasing the foam density. Compared with the rebound resilience of pure LDPE (33%), the proposed LDPE/POE foams could meet the requirements of gymnastics mats for high rebound resilience (55%). POLYM. ENG.
