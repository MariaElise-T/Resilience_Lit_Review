Through this study we aimed to explore how primary school teachers were able to adapt their teaching practices in the online context during the COVID-19 pandemic and which were the protective factors that contributed to the development of resilience. We focused on their self-assessment of online teaching quality and investigated its correlation with their level of resilience. In measuring the resilience levels of primary school teachers we have taken into account risk and protective factors. Thus, we observed that social and family support had the greatest influence on the formation of resilient attitudes among teachers. The majority of the teachers that participated in this study scored a high and very high level of resilience. We obtained a positive correlation between the chosen variables: primary school teachers' level of resilience and their self-assessment on the quality of their own online teaching during the quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
