PurposeThe paper aims to identify the most supply chain resilient company suitable for the customized preferences of partner firms in the context of the Chinese supply chain framework during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachA hybrid multicriteria model, i.e. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), was used to assign weights to each criterion, which was subsequently analyzed by three approaches, namely Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDA), to rank the top ten companies in descending order of supply chain resilience. Further, sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the consistency in ranking with variation in weights. The rankings are validated by a novel Ensemble Ranking algorithm and by supply chain domain experts.FindingsThe rankings suggest the company “China Energy Construction Group Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd” is the most feasible and resilient company, presenting interesting findings to partner firms, and Bosch is the least reliable supply chain company of the ten firms considered, thus presenting interesting findings to partner companies.Practical implications“Crisis Management Beforehand” is most critical in the current pandemic scenario. This implies that companies need to first prioritize taking proactive steps in crisis management followed by the need to minimize the “Expected impact of pandemic.” Performance factors also need to be regulated (sales, supply chain rank and financial performance) to maintain the company's overall reputation. Considering the consistent performance of the China Energy Construction Group Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd., it is recommended as the most reliable supply chain firm to forge strategic partnerships with other supply chain stakeholders like suppliers and customers. On the other hand, Bosch is not recommended as a supply chain reliable company and needs to improve its crisis management capabilities to minimize the pandemic impact.Originality/valueThe paper aims to identify the most supply chain resilient company suitable for the customized preferences of partner firms in the context of the Chinese supply chain framework during the COVID-19 pandemic.
