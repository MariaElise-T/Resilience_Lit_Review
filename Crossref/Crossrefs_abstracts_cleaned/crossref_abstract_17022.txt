Abstract
In terms of survival, resilience serves as an example of choice when confronted with situations where opportunities to choose are lacking. Thus, in such conditions, it becomes necessary to adapt to the incompatible circumstances being encountered. The traditional settlement community of Bugis Wajo holds “ulayat rights”, enabling them to thrive for generations in the vicinity of Tempe Lake. One of them, the traditional communities in Wette Hamlet in Lautang Village must grapple with annual flooding of 2–3 meters during the rainy season due to river water overflow from Tempe Lake. This flooding phenomenon stands as a testament to the unique ability of local traditional communities to adjust to normal conditions during dry seasons and adapt to the rainy seasons, allowing them to endure in their daily communal pursuits. This research employed quantitative descriptive methods and utilized eight variables, which were subsequently assigned scores to quantify resilience. Based on the results and the ensuing discussion of the analysis, it is evident that secure housing holds immense value in bolstering community resilience. There are high values in community resilience concerning community capacity, social capital, connectedness, and access to clean water. Meanwhile, there is a moderate level of community resilience when considering aspects such as disaster preparedness, livelihoods, and health. In conclusion, the analysis identifies a high degree of community resilience within the traditional community of Wettee Hamlet in Lautang Village.
