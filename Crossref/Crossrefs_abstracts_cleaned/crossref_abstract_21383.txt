Strategic resilience is achievable at different stages and with different instruments. The most used ones in normal times of equilibrium are related to the capacity of regaining stability and maintaining the continuity of institutions, relations and expected objectives, at a strategic level. The new pandemic and the turbulent world with tectonic level of changes makes resilience enter in a new era where dynamic adaptability and pro-active action should be the needed instruments in order to acquire the suitable level of resilience at a strategic level. This could mean, however, to maintain just the core tasks and basic objectives of the defence and security systems and to have the ability to give up institutional physical premises as well as to adapt details, nuances, doctrines, embracing creativity, welcoming inventive solutions and building the capacity to reform during crises at the same time with the effort to meet public requirements and to fulfil current normal day by day missions.
