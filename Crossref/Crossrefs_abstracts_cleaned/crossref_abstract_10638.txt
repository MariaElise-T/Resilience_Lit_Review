Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of mental disorders and resilience against suicide in a suicide attempt. This research is applied, in terms of purpose, and post-event in terms of type.
Methods: The statistical population of the study included all young men in Qazvin and the statistical sample included 80 of them who were purposefully selected and divided into two groups of suicide attempters and normal people. The Revised Mental Disorders Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90-R) and the Suicide Resilience Questionnaire (Osman et al., 2004) were utilized to collect data.
Results: The results showed that the mean scores of those who attempted suicide were significantly high on aggression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, physical complaints, psychosis, paranoid delusions, depression, and morbid fear than normal individuals. Also, the mean scores of those who attempted suicide were significantly lower than the normal group in the overall score of resilience and internal protective subscales, emotional stability, and external protection (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, it is suggested to increase the resilience against suicide with psychological training and with interventions based on psychotherapy theories, to address mental disorders which played an important role in a suicide attempt in the present study, and as such to reduce the risk of suicide.
