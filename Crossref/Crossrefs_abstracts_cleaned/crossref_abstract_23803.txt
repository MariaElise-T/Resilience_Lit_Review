A questionnaire survey of 500 respondents from Malaysia's indigenous community was used to gather data. The findings of this study show that most indigenous groups believe that sustainability in terms of attitudes, behaviour, and opportunity recognition has increased the aim of moving forward in entrepreneurs' adaptive resilience as compared to sustainability norms. Given that resilience is a malleable competency and that there is a positive relationship between sustainable behaviour and resilience, institutional actions are required to reinforce the social esteem of the entrepreneur among indigenous community to cope with environment challenges.
