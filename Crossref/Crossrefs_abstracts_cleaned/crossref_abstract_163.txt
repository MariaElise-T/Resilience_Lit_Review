AbstractThis article addresses measurement issues in the examination of resiliency within school settings. The Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents is described as an example of an instrument developed specifically for this purpose. This description identifies developmentally sound factors of personal resiliency that are relevant for youth in school settings. Also addressed are criteria of psychometric soundness required for universal screening and impact tracking, norm‐based profiles of personal resiliency, and summary indices of resource and vulnerability for use in screening. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
