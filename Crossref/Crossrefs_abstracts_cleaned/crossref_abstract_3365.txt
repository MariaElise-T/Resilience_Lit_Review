The growing food demand, the tendency for organic food, and the adaptation of the e-commerce business model require new food supply chain management approaches. On the one hand, 30% of the worldâ€™s produced food is wasted, and CO2 emissions are rapidly growing due to transport. On the other hand, the increasingly complex and dynamic environment is decreasing the effectiveness of food supply chains. Because of these trends, sustainability and resilience are becoming more relevant to food supply chains. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a strategy based on information exchange to improve food quality and decrease the level of CO2 emission in last-mile deliveries of food products. To achieve this goal, an agent-based model of last-mile deliveries was developed. The model simulated traffic flow and traffic accidents as disturbances in the system while measuring the level of CO2 emission and food quality of the network. The simulation compares information sharing between all vehicles in the urban area and without information sharing in four scenarios of the food industry. In practice, information sharing is achieved by using connected vehicle technology. The use of information sharing between vehicles in last-mile delivery processes allows the development of a self-organizing system, which would adapt to disturbances and lead to the development of sustainability in the long run.
