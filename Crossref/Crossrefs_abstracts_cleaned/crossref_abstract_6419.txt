One of an organization’s significant challenges in a globalized world is reducing risk by building resilient supply chains (SCs). It is required to realize a competitive advantage in a volatile and fast changing environment. Conversely, the key enablers of such sustainable and resilient supply chain management are not fully analyzed in building projects. This study aims at determining the stationary enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains. For this to happen, a questionnaire survey comprising 32 enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains has been conducted with Egyptian engineers to appraise their degree of importance. The results show that the five most important enablers of resilient and sustainable supply chains are: top management support, adaptability, visibility, quality awareness, and responsiveness. This research’s results will allow building administrators to create diverse SCs, while being mindful of how the characteristics of a supply chain decrease or increase its resilience and eventually affect the exposure to risk in the building’s SCs.
