Engineering and economics seek equilibria in the disparate dimensions of money and energy. In Part I of the present development [1] the mechanical instability of conservative systems in the domain of energy was compared to the five typical stages of events considered crises in any field, including those dimensioned in money. In that view, the economic, and engineered stability of the built infrastructure can be qualified, and to an extent quantified in terms of robustness, resilience, and sustainability. It is expanded herein with details and examples.
