Older people living with HIV (PLWH) are at risk for poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Psychological resilience may protect HRQoL in this population. The sample included 174 predominately African American PLWH (age 40â€“73). Results indicated associations between resilience, socioeconomic status, cognitive performance, instrumental activities of daily living, personality, and depressive symptoms. HIV factors (e.g. viral load, duration of HIV) were not associated with resilience. Adjusting for confounders, resilience was associated with mental HRQoL. Understanding factors associated with resilience among older PLWH and the translation of resilience to HRQoL may inform interventions to improve well-being among individuals aging with HIV.
