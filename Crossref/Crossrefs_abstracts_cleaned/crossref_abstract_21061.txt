ABSTRACTThe present exploratory study was designed to examine the relationship between resilience and job satisfaction in psychiatric nurses working in inpatient units in a large, urban medical centre. The long range goal was to understand the dimensions of job satisfaction in this inpatient environment in order to implement nurse retention programmes specifically targeted toward teaching nurses skills in developing resilience. The nurses (n = 32) reported a high level of resilience and high job satisfaction. The job satisfaction subscale of professional status had the highest mean rating among these nurses, and the physician–nurse interaction subscale had the lowest mean score. Implications for future practice and research are addressed.
