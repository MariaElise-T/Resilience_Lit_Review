PurposeMany MRI sequences are sensitive to motion and its associated artifacts. The linearized geometric solution (LGS), a balanced steady‐state free precession (bSSFP) off‐resonance signal demodulation technique, is evaluated with respect to motion artifact resilience.Theory and MethodsThe mechanism and extent of LGS motion artifact resilience is examined in simulated, flow phantom, and in vivo clinical imaging. Motion artifact correction capabilities are decoupled from susceptibility artifact correction when feasible to permit controlled analysis of motion artifact correction when comparing the LGS with standard and phase‐cycle‐averaged (complex sum) bSSFP imaging.ResultsSimulations reveal that the LGS demonstrates motion artifact reduction capabilities similar to standard clinical bSSFP imaging techniques, with slightly greater resilience in high SNR regions and for shorter‐duration motion. Flow phantom experiments assert that the LGS reduces shorter‐duration motion artifact error by ∼24%–65% relative to the complex sum, whereas reconstructions exhibit similar error reduction for constant motion. In vivo analysis demonstrates that in the internal auditory canal/orbits, the LGS was deemed to have less artifact in 24%/49% and similar artifact in 76%/51% of radiological assessments relative to the complex sum, and the LGS had less artifact in 97%/81% and similar artifact in 3%/16% of assessments relative to standard bSSFP. Only 2 of 63 assessments deemed the LGS inferior to either complex sum or standard bSSFP in terms of artifact reduction.ConclusionThe LGS provides sufficient bSSFP motion artifact resilience to permit robust elimination of susceptibility artifacts, inspiring its use in a wide variety of applications.
