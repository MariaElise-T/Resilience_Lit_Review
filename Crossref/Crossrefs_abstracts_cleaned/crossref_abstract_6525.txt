Academic resilience can be defined as the capability of students to solve their problems in times of pressure, anxiety, stress, and other setbacks. It is imperative to have insight into academic resilience as students are involved in various obstacles in the field of education. Scientific epistemological views reflect the individual's beliefs pertaining to science, its qualities, methodologies, and the individual's acquisition process. The study was undertaken to determine the relationship between academic resilience and scientific epistemological views among undergraduate students. A sample of 200 undergraduate students, comprising 72 males and 128 females, was selected through simple random sampling from different faculties of Aligarh Muslim University. Two tools were used for data collection, Academic Resilience Scale (2010) and the Scientific Epistemological Views Scale (2005). For data analysis, Pearson's coefficient of correlation and the t-test were calculated. The results revealed that there exists no relationship between the two variables. In the case of academic resilience, a significant difference was found between the male and female groups, with female students coming out as more resilient than male students. However, in scientific epistemological views, no significant difference between male and female groups was found.
