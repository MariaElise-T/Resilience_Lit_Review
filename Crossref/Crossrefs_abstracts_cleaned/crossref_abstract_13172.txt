AbstractCeramic aerogels are attractive for their promising applications in thermal insulation, ultrafiltration, catalysis, and many other areas, owing to their high porosity, low density, high specific surface area, low thermal conductivity, and thermal stability. However, the practical applications of conventional ceramic aerogels are usually impeded by brittleness. Resilient ceramic aerogels overcame the brittleness of conventional ceramic aerogels and realized reversible compressibility, but they usually show brittleness under tensile stress and limited load‚Äêbearing ability. In this short review paper, we reviewed the strategies to modify the mechanical properties of resilient ceramic aerogel. These strategies were achieved through tuning the deformation and moving ability of the nanowire building blocks and the deformation resistance provided by the aerogel architecture. Perspectives for further modifying the mechanical properties of resilient ceramic aerogel are also discussed.
