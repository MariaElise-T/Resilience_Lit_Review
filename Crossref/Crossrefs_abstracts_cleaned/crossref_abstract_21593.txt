To deal with emergencies in the development of large passenger aircraft, the optimization of supply chain resilience is studied. First, based on the “main manufacturer–supplier” model adopted by the synergistic development supply chain of large passenger aircraft, a resilience analysis framework is established from the perspective of the main manufacturer and supplier, based on which a bilateral grey quality function deployment resilience measurement model is proposed. Second, a single-perspective resilience optimization model of the main manufacturer and supplier under cost constraints is constructed. Then, an overall resilience optimization model of the supply chain considering the synergistic effect and cooperation uncertainty is presented. Finally, the development of a large airliner’s fuselage is taken as an example to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model. The results show that (1) the synergy between the main manufacturers and suppliers can not only improve resilience of the whole supply chain, but also reduce their own competitiveness and resilience, respectively; (2) a benign cooperative relationship can effectively improve the overall resilience; on the contrary, it can reduce the overall elasticity; (3) the cost of supply chain has a great impact on the resilience of the main manufacturers and suppliers, respectively.
