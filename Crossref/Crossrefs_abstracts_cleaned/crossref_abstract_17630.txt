PurposeThe aim of this study was to identify and evaluate interventions shown to improve nurse resilience in the acute care settings.Design/methodology/approachThe study was a systematically conducted scoping review of the literature. Databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Emerald insight and Google Scholar were searched and this complemented by reviews of the reference lists.FindingsIn total, 13 papers were included in the review but there was limited evidence of the effectiveness of individual programs. The authors found that resilience training programs for individuals reviewed provided some evidence for the effectiveness of the training. However, the context of job design, work risks and leadership require attention.Originality/valueResilience is an important requirement for nursing staff that helps to mitigate the stress of the working environment, particularly in the acute care setting. However, the managerial strategies required to build resilience are not well known or applied. The findings of this research may help to design cohesive and comprehensive management programs to promote and preserve nursing resilience in acute care settings. Any such program needs to reflect the four key themes that appear to underpin resilience: relationships, motivation, emotions and well-being.
