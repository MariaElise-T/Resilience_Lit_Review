Professional counselors who provided services to those affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita completed the K6+ (screen for severe mental illness), the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale. Results indicated that participants who survived the hurricanes had higher levels of posttraumatic growth than participants who served as volunteers. Both volunteer and survivor‐volunteer participants were susceptible to compassion fatigue. To further resiliency, self‐care strategies were found to minimize burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious traumatization.
