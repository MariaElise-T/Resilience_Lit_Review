Travel demand plays a moderate role in the resilience impact assessment of public transport network disruptions. We analyze how travelers can proactively build transport resilience by responding to adverse events using alternative routes. We consider route diversity (i.e., the numbers of alternative routes for all origin–destination (OD) pairs) as a measure of the network’s capability to accommodate route choice behavioral change and look for potential proactive travelers from the spatial distribution of OD pairs with alternative routes in the Beijing subway network. We further investigate how proactive resilience can be built by choosing alternative routes with the least extra time cost.
