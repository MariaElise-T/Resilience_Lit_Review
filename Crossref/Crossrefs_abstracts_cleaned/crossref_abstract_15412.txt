Increased levels of resilience will reduce the negative consequences of any disaster and develop the capacities of communities to mitigate future disasters. The main objective of this study was to measure the level of resilience of two different communities in two different study areas and compare the resilience levels in terms of a flood. The study used the Analysis of Resilience of Communities to Disasters (ARC-D) toolkit. The study was conducted in two different areas to compare the level of community resilience. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the study. A structured questionnaire was developed by using the toolkit. Results of the study indicated that communities in study area 1 were more resilient than communities in study area 2. Communities from study area 1 were more aware of their risk(s) and problem(s) and ensured proper strategies and actions to solve problems. On the other hand, communities in study area 2 were less aware of their risk(s). The strategies and actions implemented by the communities of study area 1 focused on the short-term problem(s), which reduced their level of resilience. Measuring resilience is very important in terms of developing disaster risk reduction (DRR) plans and incorporating DRR in the development process in lower-income countries and developing countries. As data scarcity is one of the major issues in developing countries, introducing a community resilience assessment mechanism can be a great help to reduce gaps in the planning and implementation process.
