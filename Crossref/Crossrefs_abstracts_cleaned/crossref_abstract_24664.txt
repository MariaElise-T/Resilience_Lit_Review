Assessment and planning of crisis management with the natural disasters approach include many components. In this regard, floods and earthquakes are some of the fundamental pillars in this field. With this view, paying attention to the current and future planning and research priorities of the world shows that crisis management in flood-prone and earthquake-prone areas and increasing resilience are the most important priorities for sustainable development studies and planning in the world. The western region of Iran (Lorestan province) has a special place due to the prominent features of flood and seismicity. This study aims to investigate the current situation regarding floods and earthquakes and increase the resilience of settlements with emphasis on the study area. After studying the current structure of flood and earthquake zoning according to multi-factor criteria, zoning was performed based on the integration of GIS and AHP information systems, and at the output of the work, high-risk settlements were determined separately for rural and urban areas with geographical coordinates, and then areas with low, very low, medium, high, and very high resilience were presented separately for rural and urban settlements. Also, after analyzing the SWOT model, strategies to increase the resilience of settlements to floods and earthquakes were presented. The study method of this research and the results, strategies, and operational options presented while being used in the study area are also applicable in other areas.
