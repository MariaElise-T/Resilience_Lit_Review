AbstractOptical fibres have been developed as a transmission medium to carry traffic in order to provide various services in telecommunications platform. Failure of this fibre caused loss of data which can interrupt communication services. This paper has been focused only on survivable schemes in order to guarantee both protection and restoration in WDM optical networks. In this paper, a dynamic resilience approach has been proposed whose objective is to route the flows in a way which minimizes the total amount of bandwidth used for working and protection paths. In the proposed approach, path-based protection is utilized because it yields lower overhead and is also suitable for global optimization where, in case of a single link failure, all the flows utilizing the failed link are re-routed to a pre-computed set of paths. The simulation results demonstrate that proposed approach is much more efficient as it provides better quality of services (QoS) in terms of network resource utilization, blocking probability etc. as compared to conventional protection and restoration schemes. The proposed approach seems to offer an attractive combination of features, with both ring like speed and mesh-like efficiency.
