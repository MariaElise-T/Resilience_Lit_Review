The study focuses on the psychodynamic approach to the psychological consequences of acquired motor disabilities in paraplegic individuals following a traffic accident.

The author discusses adaptive strategies and resilience mechanisms used to overcome these identity challenges and reconcile with a new sense of self, a new post-traumatic identity
