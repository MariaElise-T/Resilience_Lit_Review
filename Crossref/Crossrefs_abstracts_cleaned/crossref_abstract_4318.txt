A resilient robot can recover its original function after partial damage of the system. This paper develops an underactuated resilient robot that utilizes a combination of passive joints, active joints, adjustable links, and passive links. A novel method based on the genetic algorithm was proposed to determine the goal configuration of a partially damaged robot. The novelty of the method lies in the integration of both discrete and continuous variables. This model is illustrated by a 3-DOF robot manipulator in the simulation.
