AbstractHospitals play essential roles in modern communities in the lives of people. During and after earthquakes, they are supposed to be resilient and provide continued medical and social services. Resilience assessment methods are essential for determining hospitals' resilience levels, and the results will provide a direct basis and foundation for the design of new hospitals and retrofit optimization of existing hospitals. This paper reviews the resilience assessment methods and performance measures for hospitals subjected to earthquakes. Current assessment methods are divided into indicator‐ and functionality‐based categories, and the performance measures for quantifying the functionality of hospitals are classified into availability, productivity, quality, and hybrid. This study will assist stakeholders and managers in understanding available assessment methods.
