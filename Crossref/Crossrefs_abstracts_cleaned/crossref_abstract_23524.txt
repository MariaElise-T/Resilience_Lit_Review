 A high level of resilience is positively related to successful aging. However, interventions to increase resilience in older adults are not yet available. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of community participation in the relationship between resilience and successful aging. Data from 284 individuals aged 60Â years and above were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. The pathways among resilience, community participation, and successful aging were statistically significant after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, depression, disability, and chronic disease. The analysis revealed a partial mediating effect of community participation (unstandardized estimate = .01, p < .01), explaining 16.4% of the total effect of resilience on successful aging. Promoting community participation may be beneficial for enhancing successful aging in community-dwelling older adults. Further studies to examine the causal relationship between community participation and successful aging and to develop community services are recommended to use community resources as means to support successful aging.
