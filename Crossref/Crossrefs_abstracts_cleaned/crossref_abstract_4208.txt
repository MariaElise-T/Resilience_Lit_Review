In the last few decades, climate change and urbanization have made natural disasters worse all over the world. This has increased the likelihood of flash flood disasters. The purpose of this research is to determine if the six key processes (retention, detention, infiltration, purification, storage, and drainage system) of the China sponge city concept have been accounted for in the projects carried out to construct flood-resilient towns in Sri Lanka, as well as the influence of flood mitigation. This research has identified projects that have adapted the concept's main processes by reviewing the report of the Weras Ganga Development Plan, conducting key informant interviews, and a field survey. As a result, flood height is reduced in Boralesgamuwa and sub-urban areas. But some stages are missed because the SCC is not applied as a concept to flash flood control projects in Sri Lanka.
