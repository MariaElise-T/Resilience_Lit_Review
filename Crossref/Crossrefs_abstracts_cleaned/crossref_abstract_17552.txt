AbstractAimThis study investigated the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between academic stress, COVID‐19 anxiety, and quality of life (QoL) among Filipino nursing students during the COVID‐19 pandemic.BackgroundThe COVID‐19 pandemic has impacted the QoL of nursing students who are experiencing mental health issues. The mediating role of resilience in mitigating the effects of academic stress and COVID‐19 anxiety on nursing students’ QoL remains understudied.MethodsThis study employed a correlational cross‐sectional design, with a convenience sample of 611 Filipino nursing students. Data were collected using the scales Connor and Davidson Resilience, Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life, COVID‐19 Anxiety, and Perception of Academic Stress and analyzed using Pearson's r, bivariate analysis, and multistage regression analyses.ResultsAcademic stress and COVID‐19 anxiety negatively correlated with QoL and resilience. Resilience was positively associated with QoL and reduced the effect of academic stress on QoL, indicating that resilience is a crucial mediating variable between academic stress and QoL. Finally, resilience had a significant mediating influence on QoL, as evidenced by a reduction in the effect of COVID‐19 anxiety on QoL among nursing students.ConclusionsFilipino nursing students' QoL was affected by academic stress and COVID‐19–related anxiety. However, resilience mediated this impact, preserving QoL.Implications for nursing and health policyNursing colleges and affiliated hospitals must collaborate to monitor academic stress and pandemic‐related anxiety. Nursing students should be provided with programs such as seminars and team‐building activities to enhance their resilience.
