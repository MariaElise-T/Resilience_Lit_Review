Background: Resilience engineering (RE) is a new approach to upgrade safety management  systems. Due to its novelty in the field of safety, RE seems to be promising in providing good
indicators to assess priorities in organizational strengths/weaknesses while planning to promote
safety within organizations. Several methods have been recently developed to evaluate RE
performance. The current study is an attempt to quantify and determine the priorities of RE
dimensions in a steel industry using analysis network process (ANP).
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 489 male workers of a steel industry participated. For
this purpose, the RE questionnaire was distributed among workers and, then, super decisions
software (version 3.2) was used to analyze the data.
Results: The results indicated that there was a sufficient level of RE in the organization where
top management commitment with normalized weight 0.1781 and awareness-opacity with
normalized weight 0.1483 were ranked as the first and last priorities of the organization,
respectively.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the top management system, with the adoption
of safety policies, has been able to improve the performance of RE in the organization. Managers
should consider appropriate measures to improve the RE situation.
