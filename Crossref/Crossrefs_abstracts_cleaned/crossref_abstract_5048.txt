AbstractResilience is a broad concept allowing us to understand health and well‐being as a multidimensional process that continually grapples with a multitude of stressors. Currently, there are efforts across disciplines and scales to develop this concept of resilience. Unfortunately, individual and community resilience efforts tend to only abstractly conceptualize macroscale dynamics while social–ecological efforts tend to treat individuals and communities as nonindependent components of these macroscale dynamics. Combining these efforts is needed to create a robust dialog around resilience. This paper reviews and synthesizes social–ecological, community, and individual resilience literature by proposing longitudinal, multilevel models of resilience. In developing these models, some of the issues that have prevented synthesizing these literatures are resolved, including generalizability issues, within system variation, and the operationalization of social and natural and micro‐ and macroscale factors. Three brief examples are presented to elaborate on the utility of the multilevel model of resilience.
