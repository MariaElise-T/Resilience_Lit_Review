Larry Lynam of the AMWA Florida Chapter graciously invited me to speak last year at one of the monthly First Thursday virtual networking meetings the chapter regularly organizes. Our initial focus was on how I researched and wrote my memoir, Resilience: One Family’s Story, which was published in October 2019.1 Following my presentation, we had a lively discussion on the tools I used to organize the large amount of information generated from my research to write the memoir. As the processes and tools I used in writing the memoir are equally valuable in my medical writing, I was prompted to write this article to share them with the wider AMWA membership.
