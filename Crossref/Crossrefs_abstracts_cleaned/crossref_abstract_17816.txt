The aim: To investigate the impact of special physical training sessions on the formation of cadets’ psychological resilience and physical readiness for the stress factors of future professional and combat activities. 
Materials and methods: The research involved 96 cadets (men) in the 2nd training year of S. P. Koroliov Zhytomyr Military Institute (Ukraine) aged 18-20 years, who were divided into two groups: the experimental (E, n = 47) and the control (C, n = 49). The cadets of the E group studied according to the authors’ program, and the C group cadets – according to the existing program. Cadets’ psychological resilience was studied using psycho-diagnostic methods aimed at assessing their volitional qualities. Cadets’ physical fitness was assessed by the tests of general and special physical training. 
Results: It was found that the level of general physical training of the E and the C group cadets was significantly the same (p > 0.05) at the end of the research but in terms of special physical training and psychological readiness, the E group cadets had all indicators significantly (p < 0.05-0.001) better than those of the C group. 
Conclusions: It has been proved that the special physical training sessions conducted according to the authors’ program were more effective than the existing program in forming cadets’ physical readiness and psychological resilience for stress factors of future professional and combat activities.
