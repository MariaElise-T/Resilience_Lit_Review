Authentic leaders are recognized as self-aware individuals who act according to their values and beliefs in the organization. Most of the studies have acknowledged the positive impact of authentic leaders on followers. However, the characteristics of an authentic leader, such as making decisions according to his/her own belief system, might negatively affect the followers. The current study aims to investigate the relationship of authenthic leadership/leaders (AL) and creativity through the mediating role of resilience. In this study, data were collected from 172 nurses working at public hospitals using a three-wave, time-lagged study design. The findings show that authentic leadership significantly predicts hope among employees. A hopeful individual positively reflects creativity in the workplace and also mediates the relationship between authentic leadership and creativity at workplace. These results report that authentic leadership impacts hope in a positive manner; thereby, increasing the level of creativity of nurses at the workplace. The study also highlights that if a resilient nurse is supervised by an authentic leader, it decreases hope and eventually creativity at work. The paper elaborates theoretical and practical implications for the health care sector along with limitations and direction for future research.
