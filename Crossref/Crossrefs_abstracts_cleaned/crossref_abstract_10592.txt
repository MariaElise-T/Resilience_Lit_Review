It is well established that pediatric oncology is perceived as a setting that is personally and professionally demanding. Many sources acknowledge the development of conditions, such as burnout, compassion fatigue and vicarious traumatization, as a result of being continuously subjected to highly stressful circumstances in a professional capacity. There are a myriad of individual and collaborative factors that are known to mediate stress in the oncology setting. One such factor is resilience. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate what is known about coping and its relationship with resilience in assisting pediatric oncology nurses to manage work-related stressors. From the themes identified within the reviewed studies, it is clear that the applicability of resilience in pediatric oncology nursing has not been thoroughly investigated. The literature suggests that the presence of resilience among pediatric oncology nurses is possible. What is not known is whether there is a link between this resilience and ability to cope with the stressors of pediatric oncology.
