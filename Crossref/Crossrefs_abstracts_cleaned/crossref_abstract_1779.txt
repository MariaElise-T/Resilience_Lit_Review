Introduction: The impact of resiliency on professional burnout in nurses has been evaluated in several studies. This meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effect of resiliency on different aspects of nurses' professional burnout.
Materials and Methods: Publications were identified through targeted literature review in national and international databases between 1980 â€“ 2017, in Persian and English. Two independent coders assessed and extracted articles. Data analysis was done by random effects model. Study heterogeneity was measured by I2 test. The data were analyzed by STATA software v. 14.
Results: Initially, 227 articles were extracted. After titles and abstract screening, 108 articles were selected for full text review. Only five of them had the necessary inclusion criteria for analysis. The meta-analysis performed on these observational studies showed that correlation between resiliency and burnout was -0.57 with a 95% confidence interval of -0.354 to -0.726.
Conclusion: Regarding the inverse relationship between resiliency and burnout, it is recommended to plan for the interventions that can improve the resilience of nurses against burnout. Conducting interventional and resilient training courses for nurses in nursing education can be considered.
