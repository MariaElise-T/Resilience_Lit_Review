AbstractThis study explores the relations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), mental health and resilience among Hispanic adults living in the United States – Mexico Border region. Numerous studies have investigated the negative impact of ACEs on adult mental health, but the concept of resilience as a protective factor for mental health in the Hispanic communities has limited consideration in ACE treatment interventions. The proposed study addresses this gap in knowledge by investigating relations between ACEs, resilience, and mental health. An online survey was administered to 221 university students to assess the relationship between ACEs, mental distress and resilience. Using hierarchical linear regression, three models were estimated. First, including demographics, second including ACEs and low resilience, followed by the interaction of ACEs and resilience. Analyses indicate that ACEs were associated with mental distress (B = 1.02, 95% CI 0.37 – 1.68, p < 0.01) and low resilience was associated with mental distress (B = 5.37, 95% CI 3.15 – 7.59, p < .01). The interaction between ACEs and low resilience was also related to mental distress (B = 1.32, 95% CI 0.17 – 2.47, p = 0.03), indicating that ACEs had a larger association with mental distress among respondents with low resilience. Findings highlight the importance of the direct association between resilience and mental distress, along with the moderating influence of resilience on the relation between ACEs and mental health. Interventions promoting resilience may be effective in reducing mental distress, especially among individuals with a history of ACEs.
