            ) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important for maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance. The pivotal role of Tregs in immune tolerance demands that they possess a dedicated molecular machinery to maintain stable Foxp3 expression when challenged by an inflammatory environment. Whereas epigenetic mechanisms acting on the
            foxp3
            locus have been extensively implicated in Tregsâ€™ stable expression of Foxp3, the detailed molecular machinery remains elusive. In this study, we show that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an X-linked multifunctional epigenetic regulator, is a crucial player in the epigenetic machinery that confers Tregs with resilience against inflammation. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic description by which MeCP2, a molecule best known for its function in the central nervous system, regulates Treg function and immune tolerance.
