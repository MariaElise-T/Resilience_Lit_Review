SummaryThe study of resilience may lead to the identification of new targets for prevention and intervention, yet there has been little research on why some people, but not others, show resilience after facing stressful life events. New research in this issue shows that resilience is equally explained by genetic and environmental influences, and that individual experiences and situational factors are both important in shaping resilient responses to stress. These findings could inform the development of interventions that enhance psychiatric resilience after exposure to adversity.
