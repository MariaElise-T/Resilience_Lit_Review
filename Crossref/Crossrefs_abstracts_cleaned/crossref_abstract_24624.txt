"Teacher well-being is a critical factor in the overall success of educational institutions and plays a significant role in student outcomes. This paper delves into the intersection of counseling and resilience pedagogy as a comprehensive approach to support and enhance teacher well-being. By fostering resilience and providing professional counseling, we can address educators' challenges and promote a healthier, more supportive working environment. The study examines teachers' unique stressors and challenges, including high workload, emotional demands, and the pressure to meet performance standards. We then explore the potential benefits of counselling to provide emotional support, promote self-awareness, and equip teachers with coping strategies to manage stress and prevent burnout. Resilience pedagogy, however, focuses on cultivating the ability to adapt to and recover from adversities. This paper investigates the application of resilience pedagogy in the context of teacher well-being, outlining methods for enhancing resilience through professional development, self-reflection, and the establishment of supportive networks. We provide evidence-based recommendations for integrating counseling and resilience pedagogy in educational settings by drawing on empirical research, best practices, and case studies. We also propose a practical framework for schools and policymakers to develop and implement targeted interventions to promote teacher well-being. In conclusion, this paper has emphasized the importance of a dual approach that combines counseling and resilience pedagogy to address the well-being of educators. Investing in teacher well-being can create a more supportive environment that ultimately leads to improved educational outcomes for students and the long-term success of the education system."
