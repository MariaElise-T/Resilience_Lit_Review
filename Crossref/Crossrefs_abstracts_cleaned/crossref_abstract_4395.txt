Being a part of the military fraternity poses unique challenges to the individual, and the ripple effects on the family, especially the military school children are inevitable.  The present study focused on exploring gratitude, resilience and life-satisfaction as a function of age and gender among 371 Indian military children, aged 11-14 years. The relationship between the three measures and the impact of gratitude and resilience on life-satisfaction was studied.  Gender differences were observed with respect to the measure of resilience. A significant impact of gratitude and resilience on life satisfaction was observed. This study holds necessary implications in the field of health and well-being of military children.
