Vulnerability conditions not only depend on the exposure and susceptibility of physical elements in
hazard-prone areas but also on the socio-economic fragility and lack of social resilience and abilities to
cope. Hence, vulnerability has to be understood from a comprehensive and multidisciplinary perspective encompassing
exposure, susceptibility and lack of resilience. These factors capture conditions for the direct physical impacts (exposure and
susceptibility), as well as for indirect and at times intangible impacts (socio-economic fragility and lack of resilience), of potential
hazard events.
