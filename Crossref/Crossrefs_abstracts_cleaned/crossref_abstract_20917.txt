OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to explore the influence of nurse work characteristics, resiliency, and burnout on retention, and patient quality and safety.


BACKGROUND
With an ongoing nursing shortage, maintaining qualified nursing staff is critical. We explored the direct and indirect effects of practice environment, nurse work characteristics, and burnout on retention, and perceived quality and safety.


METHODS
Responses from 507 RNs were collected via an anonymous online survey. Theorized relationships were explored via path analysis and invariance testing.


RESULTS
Positive practice environment and favorable work characteristics lowered burnout and improved outcomes. The indirect effects of work characteristics and burnout were dependent upon individual level of resilience. Social capital minimized the effects of burnout for participants reporting below-average resilience.


CONCLUSIONS
Leader support was critical in shaping positive perception of the practice environment. A nurse leader's visibility and actions impact intent to stay. Results of this study may inform healthcare systems struggling to retain a robust, engaged nursing workforce.
