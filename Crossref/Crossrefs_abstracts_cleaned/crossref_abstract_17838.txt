AbstractOver the last ten years Turkey has gone through two different types of crises, namely the global economic crisis of 2008–2009 and the (geo)political crisis after 2015. This paper analyses the resilience of the economy of the tourism city of Antalya to both crises by focusing on the development of GDP of its inbound tourism countries and the births and deaths of both tourism and non‐tourism firms. The impact of the global economic crisis was moderate. The (geo)political crisis of 2016, by contrast, had a strong impact on Antalya’s economy. The city’s tourism arrivals strongly decreased, new firm formation stagnated, although the death rate of firms did not increase, and the sectoral diversification of new firms declined. Antalya conforms more to the engineering type of resilience to both crises than to the adaptive one which requires ability/willingness to shift into new sectors.
