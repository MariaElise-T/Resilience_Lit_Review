AbstractSpirituality is a universal phenomenon and an inherent aspect of human nature that unfolds during adolescence as the individual searches for transcendence, meaning, and purpose in life. Recently, spirituality has received attention as a source of resilience for adolescents. Theoretical perspectives and empirical research suggest that spirituality (distinctly and in relation to religiosity) promotes healthy development in adolescents, enhances the ability to cope, and leads to positive outcomes in mental health, psychological well‐being, and academic learning. Given the value of spirituality as a source of resilience, implications for educational practices to foster adolescent spiritual development are discussed in the context of school, family, and community settings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
