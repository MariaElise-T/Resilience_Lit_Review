With the development of the smart health (s-health), data security and patient privacy are becoming more and more important. However, some traditional cryptographic schemes can not guarantee data security and patient privacy under various forms of leakage attacks. To prevent the adversary from capturing the part of private keys by leakage attacks, we propose a secure leakage-resilient s-health system which realizes privacy protection and the safe transmission of medical information in the case of leakage attacks. The key technique is a promising public key cryptographic primitive called leakage-resilient anonymous Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption. Our construction is proved to be secure against chosen plaintext attacks in the standard model under the Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption and decisional linear assumption. We also blind the public parameters and ciphertexts by using double exponent technique to achieve the recipient anonymity. Finally, the performance analysis shows the practicability of our scheme, and the leakage rate of the private key approximates to 1/6.
