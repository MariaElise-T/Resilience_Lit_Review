 Historically, seed banks conferred resilience to Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands by providing propagules of many species to replace invasive plants, such as Typha ×glauca Godr. After flooding, the seed bank could allow recovery of wetland composition and structure as the water levels fall. Using the seedling emergence method to estimate seed density, species and guild richness, and floristic quality, we evaluated the resilience of five wetlands along the western coast of Green Bay, Lake Michigan by comparing seed bank attributes in areas invaded by Typha to those of neighboring uninvaded areas and to attributes of the extant vegetation. Resilience decreased from north to south among the five wetlands, mirroring a gradient of decreasing water quality. The invasive Lythrum salicaria L. dominated the seed bank of all five wetlands despite low relative abundance in the extant vegetation. The resilience of Green Bay coastal wetlands is threatened by the overwhelming presence of L. salicaria in the seed bank. Because the seed bank holds a wetland’s potential to be renewed by the natural hydrological cycle, seed bank assessment should be a routine measure of wetland resilience.
