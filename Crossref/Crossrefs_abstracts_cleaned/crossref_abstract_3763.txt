AbstractSinking and shrinking, the Vietnamese Mekong Delta is a materialization of dynamic river flows, sediment flows, and coastline processes. Past policy aspirations and extensive water infrastructures have shaped the delta into one the most significant food producing landscapes in Southeast Asia. Yet, these changes have also created new environmental risks by transforming the hydrological system. Research has produced a growing and increasingly diverse empirical literature on the delta's environmental context, without necessarily providing water resource managers, policymakers and practitioners with the information needed to galvanize more resilient development. This focus review presents a detailed overview of the recent scientific findings, exploring how the management of water resources is changing, as well as their inter‐relationship with land use, policy, socio‐economic transitions, and global environmental crises. Compound and systemic risks to the delta include climate change, hydrometeorological hazards, upstream developments and an unsustainable development trajectory. We outline scientific knowledge gaps, as well as the pressing need for sharable analysis‐ready data and innovations. Finally, we provide recommended future research avenues for multiscale actions toward a sustainable and resilient delta future.This article is categorized under:
