Abstract
The most common natural hazard in the world, flooding often damages Indonesiaâ€™s economy and claims many lives and properties. This article explores the significance of flood environmental management and socioeconomic configurations to flood resilience. The Smart Environment Model (SEM) helps understand the flow of the theoretical framework of flood reliance growth. Methodology in this research uses the quantitative method with independent sample two tests to analyze different patterns of flood experience in Malang City. The Multinomial Logistic Regression statistical analysis is used to evaluate causal models in Smart Environment Model. The Smart Environment Model provides a framework for methodically analyzing flood learning from various events (socioeconomic and smart environment) to demonstrate how to apply the SEM model and as an initial attempt to explore the question, of the linking between environmental flood management and flood resilience. These two environments are characterized by contrasting levels of flood resistance. There are differences between these two village flood resistance, Glintung Village and Sukun Village. The result shows that the SEM model has factors that are socio-economics, smart learning environment, and ecological path which have a significant impact on flood environment management. On the other hand, external factors including mitigation and preparation, have a significant in flood resilience that have subsequently in flood environmental management patterns. The linking flood environmental management and Socioeconomic to nurture flood resilience in the Face of Climate Change.
