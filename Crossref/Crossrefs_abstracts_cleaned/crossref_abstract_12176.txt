Abstract

Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore behavioral and mental health outcomes among a sample of farmers living in the United States and compare differences between male and female farmers. Methods

An online cross-sectional survey was distributed within the farming community by researchers, farming consultants, and community partners. Chi-Square and ANOVA analyses were used to explore relationships between variables of interest.


Results
Female survey respondents reported significantly higher perceived stress, and significantly lower resilience than their male counterparts. A significant interaction effect was observed between gender and farm roles on alcohol consumption patterns, with female farm owners and managers reporting binge drinking behavior most frequently.


Conclusion
This study identified distinct differences between respondents in terms of stress, resilience, and alcohol consumption patterns, based on both gender and occupational roles.
