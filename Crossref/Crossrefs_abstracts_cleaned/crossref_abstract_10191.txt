Purpose
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has experienced various natural and man-made hazards. The energy sector dominates in the UAE and protection of this critical infrastructure against any impending hazards is important. The purpose of this paper is to examine the vulnerability of Emirati energy sector, explored barriers to enhance resilience and ways to overcome identified barriers.


Design/methodology/approach
Study followed case study research strategy and multiple case studies; three electricity generating power plant facilities – one in Abu Dhabi, one in Dubai and one in Sharjah were selected. Data collection involved a combination of a questionnaire survey and semi-structured face-to-face interviews. In total 42 questionnaire responses and nine interviews among Emirati energy sector employees were analyzed.


Findings
Results indicated terrorism, atmospheric and tectonic hazards as the three main risks of vulnerability within Emirati energy sector; whereas “lack of or absence of national government legislation” and “awareness and education” are revealed as the main barriers. Improving human resource management within Emirati energy sector through better awareness, training and practices is considered as a priority.


Research limitations/implications
It is argued that the vulnerabilities and barriers identified in this study can be applicable to Emirati energy sector in general, not just the case studies represented in the study.


Originality/value
The feedback from the members of the Emirati energy sector is indicative of the latent failures and urgent issues that need to be addressed; predominately those of training, education and awareness. Findings of this study may help UAE energy sector to be prepared and build resilience for future hazards.
