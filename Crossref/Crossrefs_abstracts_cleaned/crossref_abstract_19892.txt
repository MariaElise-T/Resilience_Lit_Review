 This paper investigates the resilience of oscillatory power networks with Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics via phase difference. Here, we propose a general framework to measure the resilience of power network in response to perturbations affecting nodes and transmission lines during operation. Moreover, the assessing resilience approaches provide an estimation of the phase difference and power difference. To identify the resilience of power network that makes stable operation possible, several small-size oscillatory networks are selected to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed schemes. Simulation results show that the resilience plays a crucial role in the synchronous performance.
