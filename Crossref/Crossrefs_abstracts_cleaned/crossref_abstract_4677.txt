This study was conducted in determining the factors that affect nursesâ€™ resiliency while working in public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design was used and self-administered surveys were completed by 420 nurses. Nurses working in public hospitals have had high levels of resilience and mental well-being during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with their ProQOL found to be average. Higher levels of mental well-being and ProQOL contributed to developing better resiliency. The study poses the significance of taking preemptive measures on the parts of both the government and the healthcare institutions themselves to assist nursing professionals in enduring disasters such as the pandemic.
