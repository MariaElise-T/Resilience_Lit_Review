Background:
Nursing students experience stress that may impact their sleep and resilience, especially those attending rural campuses that may have potentially limited access to resources.


Purpose:
The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among perceived stress, sleep quality, resilience, and demographics and predictors of resilience among senior BSN students.


Methods:
In this cross-sectional study, perceived stress, sleep quality, resilience, and demographic data were collected from a senior student cohort attending a new baccalaureate nursing program on a rural Appalachian campus (N = 16). Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and multiple regression analyses.


Results:
Perceived stress significantly associated with sleep quality, resilience, and gender. Perceived stress, sleep quality, and gender significantly explained 61% of the variance in resilience, with perceived stress as the strongest predictor.


Conclusions:
Early collaborative assessment and intervention focused on mitigating stress may promote improved sleep and resilience. Availability of resources for students attending small rural campuses is essential.
