The objective of this paper was to present a dynamic resource orchestration framework as a source of organizational resilience through blended orchestration of the firm's dynamic and static resources to generate sustained value during disruptive shocks. We adopted an integrative literature review methodology and proposed a dynamic resource orchestration framework as a managerial option to create and sustain firm value. Conceptually, a dynamic resource orchestration framework was presented as the integration of firm resources and managerial capability. We proposed dynamic resource orchestration as a model input impacting organizational resilience through the combined effects of resource accumulation, resource orchestration, and managerial capabilities. Through a thorough examination of the literature production anchored on dynamic capabilities framework and organizational resilience, we advanced a perspective that the ultimate source of combined firm resilience and sustainable competitive advantage does not necessarily accrue from the resources at a firm's disposal but by how management dynamically blends and orchestrates the existing resources, thereby creating an optimal source of capability. Our proposed conceptualization was based on the assumption that dynamic capabilities are part of firm resources and, therefore, strategic orchestration of dynamic capabilities leads to superior firm resourcefulness and consequential sustained resilience. We identified gaps and proposed directions for future research.
