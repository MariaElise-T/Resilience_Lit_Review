Since 1648, the number of small states has varied significantly. There have been more than one "rise and fall" in the number of small states. This study begins a broader analysis into causality by investigating this phenomenon. By setting out the changes in the composition of the international states system since its inception in its modem form with the Peace of Westphalia, the study intends to discuss the proliferation of small states over time as a significant phenomenon in the history of international relations. The study then continues by linking the changes in the number of small states to major systemic changes, arguing that different types of states system correspond to different levels of "systemic resilience" of small states.
