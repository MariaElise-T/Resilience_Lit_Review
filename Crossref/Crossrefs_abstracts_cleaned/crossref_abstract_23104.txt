Objectives Few evidence-based psychosocial programs exist within craniofacial care. This study (a) assessed feasibility and acceptability of the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management-Parent (PRISM-P) intervention among caregivers of children with craniofacial conditions and (b) described barriers and facilitators of caregiver resilience to inform program adaptation. Design In this single-arm cohort study, participants completed a baseline demographic questionnaire, the PRISM-P program, and an exit interview. Participants Eligible individuals were English-speaking legal guardians of a child <12-years-old with a craniofacial condition. Intervention PRISM-P included 4 modules (stress-management, goal-setting, cognitive-restructuring, meaning-making) delivered in 2 one-on-one phone or videoconference sessions 1â€“2 weeks apart. Main Outcome Measures Feasibility was defined as >70% program completion among enrolled participants; acceptability was defined as >70% willingness to recommend PRISM-P. Intervention feedback and caregiver-perceived barriers and facilitators of resilience were summarized qualitatively. Results Twenty caregivers were approached and 12 (60%) enrolled. The majority were mothers (67%) of a child <1-year-old diagnosed with a cleft lip and/or palate (83%) or craniofacial microsomia (17%). Of these, 8 (67%) completed PRISM-P and 7 (58%) completed interviews; 4 (33%) were lost-to-follow-up before PRISM-P and 1 (8%) before the interview. Feedback was highly positive, with 100% willing to recommend PRISM-P. Perceived barriers to resilience included uncertainty about their child's health; facilitators included social support, parental identity, knowledge, and control. Conclusions PRISM-P was acceptable among caregivers of children with craniofacial conditions but not feasible based on program completion rates. Barriers and facilitators of resilience support the appropriateness of PRISM-P for this population and inform adaptation.
