<p>The concept of preparing communities within the United States to better respond to acts of terrorism has been evolving since the September 11 terrorist attacks and Anthrax letters of 2001. For casualties resulting from a biological or chemical incident, increasing reliance has been placed on our healthcare system for early detection and treatment. Such preparedness efforts and the unique healthcare challenges they pose remain foreign to most practicing medical professionals.</p>
