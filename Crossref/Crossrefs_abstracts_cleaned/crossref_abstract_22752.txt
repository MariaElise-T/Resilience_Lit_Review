Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of emotional labor and resilience on job satisfaction, and the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between emotional labor and job satisfaction.
Methods For this purpose, 184 social workers working at home-based senior welfare facilities located in D Metropolitan City were selected as the study subjects, and a survey was conducted with emotional labor as the independent variable, resilience as the mediating variable, and job satisfaction as the dependent variable. For the data, frequency analysis, reliability verification, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were applied to derive the research results using the SPSS program.
Results There was a significant positive relationship between inner emotional labor, control, positivity, sociability resilience, and job satisfaction recognized by social workers engaged in home-based welfare facilities for the elderly. It was found that positivity and sociability had a significant positive effect on job satisfaction. In addition, resilience was found to have a significant effect as a complete parameter in the effect of internal emotional labor on job satisfaction.
Conclusions The quality of social welfare services depends on the quality of social workers who provide a variety of services to the elderly in the field. Through this study, it was found that job satisfaction can increase when social workers appropriately control their emotions and express positive and sincere behaviors in the process of performing their duties. Therefore, social workers engaged in welfare facilities for the elderly should actively promote various measures to strengthen resilience in order to provide better services to the elderly and improve their job satisfaction.
