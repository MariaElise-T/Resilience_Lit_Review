 Resilience has been related to mental health during perinatal period.  However, to our knowledge, there are no instruments of resilience that have been validated in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Resilience Inventory in a sample of Mexican pregnant women.  A sample of 280 women was evaluated using the Resilience Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire and a stressful life events questionnaire.  The reliability coefficient of Resilience Inventory was 0.88 for the complete scale. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a three-factor structure of resilience (personal competence, religiosity and positive attitude) for pregnant women. Concurrent validity was supported by negative correlations with prenatal depressive symptoms and stressful life events. The Resilience Inventory could be a potentially a valid and reliable measure. It is necessary to continue exploring the role of resilience in the perinatal period and identify the factors that shape it.
