The concept of Resilience is now closely related to Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The built heritage plays an increasingly important role in the definition and implementation of urban resilience to disasters. In particular, historical Italian towns represent a significant example of urban organism, evolved and adapted itself a result of the seismic history of the country, which has characterized morphologies, typologies and masonry construction techniques. The objective of the research is to provide a proposal for preventive strategies for the post-crisis reconstruction, aimed to the implementation of urban resilience.
