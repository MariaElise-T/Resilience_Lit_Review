SummaryThis research work introduces some novel techniques for interference‐resilient OFDM wireless communication. Firstly, novel schemes for spatial multiplexing and interference cancelation based on signal subspace estimation are proposed. Secondly, the OFDM system is designed such that it meets three main objectives simultaneously, namely, (i) interference‐resiliency, (ii) throughput maximization, and (iii) energy consumption minimization. Interference‐cancelation techniques in prior art mostly consider maximization of throughput without any focus on energy consumption. On the other hand, the literature in energy minimization is limited to interference‐free environments. Most of the previous techniques also have a drawback that they cannot operate in smart or dynamically changing interference environments. The focus here is on interference‐resilient communication with equal attention to both throughput and energy‐efficiency maximization in dynamic hostile environments. The optimization problem is formulated, and then optimal policies and switching thresholds are found for throughput and energy‐efficient interference‐resilient communication. Methodologies for estimating the channel and jammer conditions and then adapting the transmission strategies accordingly are proposed. Moreover, to have an effective defense against smart jamming scenario, a constant‐payoff scheme is also introduced. Simulation results are compared with previous techniques that demonstrate the efficacy of proposed research. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
