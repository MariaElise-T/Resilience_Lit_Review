Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with heightened nocturnal autonomic nervous system (ANS) arousal and sleep disturbances. It has been suggested that relationships between sleep and nocturnal ANS activity are influenced by insomnia; however, investigation of this relationship has been limited in PTSD. This study examined nocturnal ANS activity and its relationship to sleep in PTSD and resilience. Physically healthy young adult African Americans with current PTSD (n = 20) or who had never had PTSD despite exposure to a high‐impact traumatic event (resilient, n = 18) were monitored with ambulatory electrocardiograms and actigraphy for 24‐hr periods. Frequency‐domain heart‐rate variability measures, that is, low‐frequency to high‐frequency ratios (LF/HF), which index sympathetic nervous system activity, and normalized HF (nHF), which indexes parasympathetic nervous system activity were examined. Normalized HF during the time‐in‐bed period was lower for those with PTSD than those with resilience (p = .041). Total sleep time was strongly correlated with time‐in‐bed LF/HF (r = −.72) and nHF (r = .75) in the resilient group, but these were not correlated in the PTSD group. The results suggest elevated nocturnal ANS arousal and dissociation between ANS activity and total sleep time in PTSD.
