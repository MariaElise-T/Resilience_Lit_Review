We demonstrate an end-to-end framework to improve the resilience of man-made systems to unforeseen events. The framework is based on a physics-based digital twin model and three modules tasked with real-time fault diagnosis, prognostics and reconfiguration. The fault diagnosis module uses model-based diagnosis algorithms to detect and isolate faults and generates interventions in the system to disambiguate uncertain diagnosis solutions. We scale up the fault diagnosis algorithm to the required real-time performance through the use of parallelization and surrogate models of the physics-based digital twin. The prognostics module tracks fault progression and trains the online degradation models to compute remaining useful life of system components. In addition, we use the degradation models to assess the impact of the fault progression on the operational requirements. The reconfiguration module uses PDDL-based planning endowed with semantic attachments to adjust the system controls to minimize the fault impact on the system operation. We define a resilience metric and use a fuel system example to demonstrate how the metric improves with our framework.
