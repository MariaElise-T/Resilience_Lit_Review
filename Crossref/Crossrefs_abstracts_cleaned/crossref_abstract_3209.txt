In a time of constant change and disruption in education, it is common for teachers to feel anxious about their chosen career. Teacher ‘resistance’ is a natural response in such circumstances and one that can take a significant personal and professional toll, both on the individual and those in their community. In this article, I aim to take a more positive approach and frame teachers’ responses to change as a form of resilience, rather than resistance, and as a mindset that can be harnessed for the benefit of the individual as well as the organization. Besides, I offer some recommendations for managers on developing a positive mindset and for teachers to take on a leadership role within the institution.
