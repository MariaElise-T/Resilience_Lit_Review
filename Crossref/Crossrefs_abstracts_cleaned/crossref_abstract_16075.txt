Abstract
Date Presented 03/26/20
The study’s aim was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of cognitive-control training using mobile phones to improve resilience and QOL among soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces. A group of 154 combat-unit soldiers were recruited and randomized to a controlled clinical trial group and an active control group. No significant effects of training on QOL, resilience, or mental health were found. The study’s results encourage OTs to develop accessible, occupation-based interventions for enhancing resilience.
