South Korean manufacturers have dealt with supply chain interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as many other manufacturers have around the world; however, it seems that some Korean manufacturers are remarkably resilient. Many Korean manufacturers have withstood perilous supply chain dynamism and maintained operational performance without interruption. This study examines the antecedents of supply chain resilience and operational performance to suggest how other manufacturers can develop and maintain continuous uninterrupted operations even amid dynamic supply chains and global disruption. This is an empirical study of South Korean manufacturers utilizing PLS-SEM analysis with mediation effects. This study examines the interrelationships of six variables including, supply chain disruption orientation, managementâ€™s intention, digital infrastructure capability, innovation adoption, supply chain resilience, and operational performance. The implications are meaningful for both scholars and practitioners alike. This paper contributes to literature pertaining to both supply chain management and technology assimilation.
