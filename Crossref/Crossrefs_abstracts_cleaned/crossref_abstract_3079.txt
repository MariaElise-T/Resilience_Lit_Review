Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental issues of the 21st century, and its impacts extend to the current society's infrastructure. Consequently, the need for resilient infrastructure to withstand climate impacts becomes paramount. This paper reviewed the need for resilient infrastructure in today's society. Literature was reviewed under three major subcategories viz a viz impacts of climate change on infrastructure, impacts of infrastructural development on climate change, and climate-resilient infrastructure. It was found that the extent to which climate change translates into risks for infrastructure depends upon the interaction of the changing climate hazards with the infrastructure. In Nigeria and Africa at large, many infrastructures give an unsatisfactory performance, and they are short-lived due to technical and non-technical factors. Extreme weather events due to climate change will likely increase disruption to these infrastructures. The paper recommended a great need to overhaul already existing infrastructure to withstand climate change disruptions better.
