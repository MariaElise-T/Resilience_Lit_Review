Abstract. Over the last few years, the world has seen many social, industrial, and technological revolutions. The latter has enabled a combination of expertise from different fields in order to manage a wide range of multidimensional issues such as integrated societies and industrial ecosystems achievement, urban planning, transport management, sustainable development and environmental protection and currently pandemics management. Super smart society's vision that is driving the 5.0 social revolutions is at the heart of the current situation that requires system resilience, sustainability, proactivity, interoperability and collaborative intelligence between society, economy, and industry. Establishing communication bridges between different entities, of different natures and with different objectives implies solutions that reinforce the development of efficient, dynamic, and communicating business models on a large scale, merging cyber and physical spaces. Through this paper we explored the potential of digital twins for the development of a new vision of world global dynamics under the aegis of a virus whose parameters are still elusive to date.
