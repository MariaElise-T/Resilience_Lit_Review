AbstractThe Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire (WFRQ) is one of the most widely used and strong theory‐based measurement tools of family resilience. This study aimed to develop and psychometrically test the Chinese version of the WFRQ (WFRQ‐C). The WFRQ was translated following Brislin's translation model. Psychometric testing, combining classical theory test and item response theory, was conducted with a sample of 800 community adult residents. The Connor‐Davidson resilience scale‐10 (CD‐RISC‐10), Self‐reported Family Happiness Scale (SFHS‐1), and Family APGAR (Adaption, Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve) Scale (Family APGAR‐5) were applied for convergent validity. Six items were deleted at the item analysis level. The minimum average partial test and a parallel analysis supported a three‐factor structure, which was validated by confirmatory factor analysis. The three factors were named “Family belief system,” “Organization, communication and problem solving,” and “Utilization of external resources.” The WFRQ‐C was significantly correlated with CD‐RISC‐10, SFHS‐1, and Family APGAR‐5, with r values ranged from 0.51 to 0.56. The Cronbach's α was 0.97 for the scale and 0.93, 0.95, and 0.72 for the three factors, respectively. The ICCs of 0.96 for the whole scale, and 0.95, 0.75, and 0.95 for the three factors, respectively. The mean score for the WFRQ‐C was 97.00 ± 17.94, of which per capita monthly income and education level were predictors. The 26‐item WFRQ‐C is a stable, concise, and validated tool to measure family resilience. It is applicable for Chinese community adults in nonspecific stressful settings and has potential utility in the health care domain.
