 In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between father presence and the resilience of adolescents, and whether failure learning mediates this association. Specifically, we obtained in-depth details on the relation between father presence and adolescents’ resilience by examining the mediating effects of four subfactors of failure learning: failure cognition, reflection and analysis, experience transformation, and prudent attempt. For this purpose, we used the questionnaire to access Chinese middle school students’ father presence, resilience, and failure learning. In total, six hundred and twenty-six valid questionnaires were collected. The results were as follows: (1) there was a significant positive correlation between father presence, failure learning, and resilience; (2) failure learning played a mediating role between father presence and adolescents’ resilience; (3) the mediating effect of experience transformation and prudent attempt (two subfactors of failure learning) between father presence and adolescents’ resilience was significant, while the mediating effect of failure cognition and reflective analysis (the other two subfactors of failure learning) was insignificant.
