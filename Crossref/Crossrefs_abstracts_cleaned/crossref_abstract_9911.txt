 This paper sets out the approach, solutions and lessons learned in designing sustainable and resilient water and energy infrastructure for the Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture. It showcases the role that decentralised infrastructure and nature-based solutions can play in addressing the demand for infrastructure and food security. It argues there is a need to design for both current and future uncertainty, and to work with and protect the environment. Finally, it discusses the role of knowledge sharing between international and local partners to build and benefit from capability across the project team and ensure appropriate solutions for the context are adopted.
