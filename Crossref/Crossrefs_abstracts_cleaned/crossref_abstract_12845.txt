AbstractFood systems in Indonesia and other developing countries have witnessed a rapid change in production, trade, and consumption patterns. The central highlands and northeastern coast of Bali form one such system, with centuries of documented regional trade relations between coastal and highland communities whose food products were complementary. This paper adopts a moral economy approach to explain the decline in local food security at a systemic level, and to explore also how it may be reversed. In particular, I explore how this regional food system operated, and how modernization since the 1990s has compromised biodiversity, ecological sustainability, social resilience, and food security. Greater attention to this moral dimension of food systems, it is argued, will contribute to more successful agricultural development and food security programs.
