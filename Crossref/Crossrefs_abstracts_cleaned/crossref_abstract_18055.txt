AbstractEmerging studies allude to high stress in autistic adults. Considering the detrimental impact of stress on health outcomes, examining individual resources which may influence the extent to which stress is experienced (e.g., coping and resilience) is vital. Using a person‐focused approach, this study aimed to identify coping‐resilience profiles, and examine their relations to general perceived stress and daily hassles in a sample of autistic adults (N = 86; aged 19–74 years). Cluster analysis identified four coping‐resilience profiles (i.e., high cope/ low resilience, low cope/ high resilience, engage cope/ high resilience, and disengage cope/ low resilience). The high cope/ low resilience and disengage cope/ low resilience groups had significantly higher general perceived stress than the remaining groups. No significant group differences were noted in relation to daily hassles. Jointly addressing coping and resilience may be beneficial on the perceived stress experienced in autistic adults. The use of coping‐resilience profiles may also allow for the personalization of stress management and support options in the autistic adult population.
