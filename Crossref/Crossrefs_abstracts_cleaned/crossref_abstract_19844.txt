COVID created a perfect storm of conditions leading to excessive and prolonged stress on already vulnerable nurses. This study examines the feasibility of enhancing psychiatric mental health nurses' (PMHNs') resilience by practicing a 3-minute mindfulness-based intervention. In this pilot study, we explored if PMHNs could be recruited and retained for intervention implementation, intervention acceptability, and measurement of any notable changes over the prescribed period. Study feasibility is reflected in high participant retention and increased postintervention resilience scores. Given the positive outcomes, a larger-scale study is warranted. Additional areas of opportunity include strategies for increasing participant uptake, and, due to limited acceptability feedback, the introduction of a usefulness scale.
