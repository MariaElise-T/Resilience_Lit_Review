 Sustainable transport commonly considers either the interaction between built and natural environments or the interface between transportation and interdependent critical infrastructure. Although considering each of these key dimensions is a crucial task for achieving sustainable transport, the dimensions are infrequently considered together. When an integrated network design framework is proposed, two important issues are taken into account: ( a) the aftermath of potential severe weather episodes on metropolitan-area infrastructure and ( b) the existing interdependencies across transportation and fuel supply chain networks. Then the response of infrastructure in the face of flooding hazards is investigated. Framed within a multistage linear stochastic program, the proposed model seeks to find fueling station deployment that provides the transportation network with optimum random functionality when the network is stressed or under attack. A set of numerical experiments illustrates how changes to enhancement strategies at different stages of government affect the optimal investments in resilient design.
