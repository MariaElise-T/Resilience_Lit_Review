The information in this study was using software or application developed based on a conceptual model formed as a framework for SMEs’ managers in dealing with natural disasters. The conceptual model was shaped based on actual data from SMEs’ owners and leaders, as well as stakeholders in four regencies in the Madura Island, Indonesia, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep, by identifying the variables or dimensions of SMEs’ resilience to natural disasters. The conceptual model was produced using sequence and use case diagrams to identify the relationship between risk and resilience dimensions to measure the level of resilience of SMEs. The level SMEs’ resilience to natural disasters was the basis of information received by SMEs’ owners and leaders. This study is expected to help SMEs to determine the level of SMEs’ resilience to the risk of natural disasters to minimize the existing risks.
