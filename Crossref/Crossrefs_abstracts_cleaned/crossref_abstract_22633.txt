Abstract
As the temperature-humidity index (THI) increases, animals are less able to regulate body temperature leading to decreases in production and immune function. The High Immune Response (HIR™) technology classifies animals based on estimated breeding values (EBVs) of their IR capacity as high (H), average (A), or low (L). H-responders with their unique IR genotype have less disease than A or L, but have not been evaluated for adaptation to heat stress. Therefore, rectal temperatures of beef & dairy cows with known IR classification were recorded during THI&lt; 74 (normal) and THI&gt;74 (above normal). Results show that 50% of beef & 65% of dairy cows had body temperature above 39.2 at THI&gt;74. However, cows that ranked H for antibody response were significantly better at regulating temperature and respiration at THI&gt;74, than A or L. In vitro experiments showed variability in PBMC function when cells were heat stressed (42□, 4hrs). PBMC were stimulated with ConA to measure proliferation or LPS to assess nitric oxide (NO) production. HSP70 was measured in control and heat treated cells. Dairy results indicated that H responders had significantly greater cell proliferation across all treatments and greater NO and HSP production with significance depending on the treatment. Beef results indicate that HSP70 from unstimulated PBMC increased after 1 or 2 heat treatments, and the magnitude of the change varied by IR class. Conversely, PBMCs challenged with LPS produced more NO before than after heat treatments. These results indicate that cattle with diverse immune response genotypes vary in their ability to withstand heat stress, and that it should be possible to identify resilient individuals with both greater immunity and adaptation to climate warming.
