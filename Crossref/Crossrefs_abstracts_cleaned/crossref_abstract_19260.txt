 This study examined strengths (i.e., empowerment, purpose) and challenges (i.e., depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology, financial and housing worries) experienced by women ( N = 44) with histories of addiction and victimization newly admitted to a sober living home (SLH). Women had moderate to high levels of both strengths and challenges. In general, strengths and challenges were inversely related (e.g., higher purpose was related to lower depression), and challenges were positively related (e.g., higher financial worries were related to higher posttraumatic stress symptoms). The findings remind us that women entering SLHs have myriad needs and that comprehensive services drawing upon women's resilience are needed.
