AbstractMitigation education policies have not been implemented optimally in schools because they have not received synergistic social support. This study will articulate four main points, which are: 1) social support for disaster mitigation education policy; 2) school resilience profile; 3) development of school’s resilience policy, and 4) factors influencing the success of policy implementation. The research method is descriptive analysis approach to describe the respondents’ opinions as they are regarding the draft policy brief and the indicators of school resilience policies for disaster mitigation. The study sample consisted of the heads of the education office and the principals of upper secondary schools in Indonesia. Sample selection was done by purposive sampling, from the regions in 18 disaster-prone provinces, 24 heads of department and 24 principals of each disaster-prone area at the high school level in Indonesia are taken as respondents. The data collection technique used in the study was the use of online media through Google Forms and focus group discussion through Zoom meetings. The results of the study concluded that: 1) disaster mitigation education policies require social support from the central government, regional governments, higher educational establishments, and students who work synergistically; 2) the school’s resilience profile is still relatively low and requires school policies strengthening; 3) the development of school resilience policies requires strategic and proactive steps from the school; 4) the success of the policy implementation is largely determined by the school’s strategy in dealing with the supporting and hindering factors. By successfully implementing school resilience policies in schools in Indonesia, the role of schools will be more optimal in disaster mitigation.
