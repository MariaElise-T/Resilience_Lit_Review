The planning and transformation of existing energy systems through renewable energy sources and the cleanest fossil fuels is considered to be one of the most promising and effective strategies for achieving the transition to a low-carbon world. At the same time,due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy and the frequent occurrence of extreme disasters comes with decreasing system inertia and much faster frequency drop when contingency of large power loss occurs, which seriously threatens the security of power system operation, so more and more attention is being paid to the safety and security of power systems in key areas. In order to achieve energy transition and emergency security through optimal distributed energy, this paper proposes a hybrid energy system of photovoltaic - natural gas - energy storage. A multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously considers economic costs, environmental benefits and system resilience is then developed, utilizing fuzzy satisfying approach to obtain the optimal system configuration under the decision makerâ€™s attitude parameters. A case study from an industrial park is conducted to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization method. The calculations show that multi-objective optimisation of distributed energy systems can reduce carbon emissions by 75,364 to 414,997 tonnes per year, and can also effectively respond to extreme disasters by ensuring the normal operation of critical loads with high priority and the safety of the system through appropriate load shedding for loads with low priority.
