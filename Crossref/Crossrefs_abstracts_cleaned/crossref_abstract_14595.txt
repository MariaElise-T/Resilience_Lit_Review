The challenge is understanding how Iraq's political and historical conditions after the 2003 US invasion have affected its economy. The report examines post-conflict reconstruction in Iraq and its economy. This study examined economic figures, government legislation, and scholarly works. We analyse economic statistics and current trends in Iraq to assess its economic recovery. The analysis found that Iraq's economy has been erratic since 2003.
