Abstract
Soil microbiota has increasingly been shown to play an integral role in viticulture resilience. The emergence of new metagenomic and culturomic technologies has led to significant advances in the study of microbial biodiversity. In the agricultural sector, soil and plant microbiomes have been found to significantly improve resistance to environmental stressors and diseases, as well as influencing crop yields and fruit quality thus improving sustainability under shifting environments. Grapevines are usually cultivated as a scion grafted on rootstocks, which are selected according to pedoclimatic conditions and cultural practices, known as terroir. The rootstock connects the surrounding soil to the vineâ€™s aerial part and impacts scion growth and berry quality. Understanding rootstock and soil microbiome dynamics is a relevant and important field of study, which may be critical to improve viticulture sustainability and resilience. This review aims to highlight the relationship between grapevine roots and telluric microbiota diversity and activity. In addition, this review explores the concept of core microbiome regarding potential applications of soil microbiome engineering with the goal of enhancing grapevine adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress.
