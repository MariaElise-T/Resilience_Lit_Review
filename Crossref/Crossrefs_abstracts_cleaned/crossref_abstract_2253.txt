ABSTRACTWe extend the intelligent career framework to support a rapidly expanding nascent and mobile workforce: edu‐immigrants. Edu‐immigrants undertake international post‐secondary education for the purpose of remaining and working in a new country. Interviews were conducted with community stakeholders, which informed the development of a cross‐sectional open‐ended survey of 374 edu‐immigrants. The more resilient relied upon their own coping strategies to seek permanent settlement and career aid. They were challenged by a lack of a perceived legitimate stake and few key “knowing whom” contacts. Universities and community can facilitate the establishment of supportive social and professional networks for edu‐immigrants. Our findings contribute by providing new knowledge about the universality of the intelligent career in the context of international education and immigration.
