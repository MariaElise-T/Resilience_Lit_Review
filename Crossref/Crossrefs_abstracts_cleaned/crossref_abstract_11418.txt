Climate change and growth in coastal population make many American communities increasingly vulnerable to coastal disasters such as hurricanes, winter storms, and tsunamis. This research argues that neighborhood-level organizations can and should play a significant role in preparation for and response to such events. In particular, neighborhood and homeowner associations routinely play key roles in mobilizing community response to safety, physical decay, and infrastructure problems, all central concerns in preparation for and recovery from natural disaster. Neighborhood organizations then can act as lynchpin actors in a multiorganizational cooperation framework for disaster preparation, recovery, and resilience.
