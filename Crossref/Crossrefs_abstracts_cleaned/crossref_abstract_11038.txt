Background:
High rates of nursing faculty burnout and moral distress fuel faculty attrition, which directly affects our ability to educate new nurses. This study investigated the relationships among resilience, moral courage, and purpose to inform strategies to promote well-being in nursing faculty.


Method:

              A descriptive, correlational study was conducted using a convenience sample of nursing faculty in the United States and Canada (
              n
              = 690). Participants completed three surveys: the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Moral Courage Scale for Nursing Faculty (MCNF), and the Meaning of Life Questionnaire (MSQ), as well as a single open-ended question.
            


Results:
Moral courage was moderately correlated to resilience, and the Meaning of Life Presence subscale was moderately correlated to resilience. Meaning of life presence and meaning of life search were moderately negatively correlated.


Conclusion:

              Resilience, moral courage, and purpose are essential in promoting professional fulfillment and personal well-being in nursing faculty.
