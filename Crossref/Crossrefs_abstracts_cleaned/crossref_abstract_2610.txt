A three‐dimensional finite element analysisObjective:  The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of mucosal properties and relining material on the stress distribution in peri‐implant bone tissue during masticatory function with a conventional complete denture during the healing period through finite element analysis.Materials and Methods:  Three‐dimensional models of a severely resorbed mandible with two recently placed implants in the anterior region were created and divided into the following situations: (i) conventional complete denture and (ii) relined denture with soft lining material. The mucosal tissue properties were divided into soft, resilient and hard. The models were exported to mechanical simulation software; two simulations were carried out with a load at the lower right canine (35 N) and the lower right first molar (50 N). Data were qualitatively evaluated using Maximum Principal Stress, in MPa, given by the software.Results:  All models showed stress concentrations in the cortical bone corresponding to the cervical part of the implant. The mucosal properties influenced the stress in peri‐implant bone tissue showing a different performance according to the denture base material. The simulations with relined dentures showed lower values of stress concentration than conventional ones.Conclusions:  It seems that the mucosal properties and denture reline have a high influence on the stress distribution in the peri‐implant bone during the healing period.
