 There is growing evidence that contact surfaces within healthcare settings can serve as reservoirs for pathogen colonization and spread infectious bacteria to humans. This article aims to demonstrate the use of a Prevention through Design Environment Material Integrative Control (PtD-EMIC) instrument to predict the infection prevention resilience potential of materials commonly used for healthcare contact surfaces. PtD-EMIC is based on fuzzy logic and Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System architecture. Its objective is to serve as a computational design tool that guides the selection and specification of interior materials that may moderate the spread of pathogens in healthcare environments. This objective is accomplished through an applied systems requirement simulation framework that can help guide interior material choice and design for healthcare spaces. The motivation for developing this instrument is to provide a vehicle that can expand healthcare design industry capabilities and interior environment analysis research by using computational approaches to inform interior material selection and design decisions that support healthcare environmentsâ€™ infection control strategies. The selection and sourcing of embedded data related to relevant and high-use acute care treatment area finishes, the premise of instrument use, precedent research basis, and system architecture, as well as tool validation and demonstration of use, are all discussed. The text explains how using this instrument can facilitate categorization and leveraging interior material performance outcome data for informing safety-critical healthcare design.
