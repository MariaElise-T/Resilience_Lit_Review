 This article reviews the conceptualization of resilience and empirically examines the dimensionality of a construct of resilience and adaptation by using structural equation modeling techniques. As part of a longitudinal study of youth development, youth ages 12, 14, and 16 and their parents who lived in high-risk neighborhoods in the Denver metropolitan area were interviewed. The construct of resilience and adaptation was measured by six indicators: psychosocial functioning, self-esteem, academic performance, absence or low level of drug use, gang involvement, and delinquent activities. Factor analyses using LISREL suggest the existence of at least two latent constructs of resilience and adaptation: Adjustment and low level of Antisocial Behavior. Implications of the findings are discussed.
