With the continuous development of public transportation, the impact of unexpected events on the operation of bus networks has become increasingly severe due to the growing demand for public transportation and passenger volume. To accurately assess the impact of unexpected events on the operation of bus networks and scientifically evaluate their resilience, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing the resilience of bus networks. With the aim of providing scientific evidence to enhance the reliability of public transportation networks, this framework can be used to determine the resilience of bus networks to unexpected events. The main contributions of this framework include three aspects: 1. Construction of the CRITICâ€“entropy weighting model for screening and calculating key indicators of the resilience of the bus network; 2. Use of resilience cycle theory to construct a model for analyzing the resilience of bus routes, and design a set of resilience quantification factors to calculate the resilience of bus routes; 3. Use of complex network theory to construct a model for analyzing the resilience of the bus network, by taking the bus route resilience obtained in the second step as the edge weight to calculate the resilience of the bus network. This paper takes the Beijing public transit system as an example and uses real data to verify the accuracy, scientificity, and feasibility of the proposed framework for analyzing the resilience of public transit networks to sudden events. The resilience analysis framework constructed in this paper has improved the existing research on transportation network resilience in theoretical aspects. Furthermore, the results outputted by this framework can provide a decision-making basis for network adjustment and disaster recovery for the management departments of public transportation networks in practical applications.
