This systematic literature review of librariansâ€™ responses to traumatic and tragic events in the school ecology curates the existing anecdotal and empirical evidence to identify gaps in the research and suggest areas for future research. Using resilience as the conceptual framework, the authors implemented a review protocol to plan, conduct, and report on the role of librarians across the profession and more specifically within the school ecology and school library environment when faced with unforeseen circumstances. Results show that while the field lacks empirical studies on the topic, information available through the popular and professional media can begin to provide some background to inform future research.
