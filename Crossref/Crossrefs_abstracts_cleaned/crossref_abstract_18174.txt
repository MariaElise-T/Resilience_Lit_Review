 In people with intellectual disabilities research and policy are often still focused on risks or the prevention of risks. Research on the process of resilience is in its infancy in the care for people with intellectual disabilities. In the current study, applying a guided photovoice procedure, people with intellectual disabilities were asked what helped them to deal with adverse events. Additionally, informants from their social network were asked to reflect on this question. The following sources of resilience were identified: acceptance, autonomy, beautiful memories, perseverance, physical wellbeing, positive emotions, social skills, spirituality, activities, a home and the social network. Our findings provide practical guidelines for clinicians to talk about resilience with people with intellectual disabilities. Suggestions for future research are made that will contribute to the process of resilience and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities.
