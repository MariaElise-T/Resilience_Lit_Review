Objectives This study aims to define resilience of spousal family caregivers for older adults living with dementia in the Vietnamese context. Methods A directed content analysis was conducted on 22 interview transcripts, including nine follow-up interviews, of a sub-sample of 13 spousal caregivers, drawn from a larger study with family caregivers for relatives with dementia in a hospital in Vietnam. The study started with key categories from the theory of the unifying model of resilience in dementia caregiving to guide the analysis process, while new codes and categories were identified during this process. Findings The study results show a revision and extension of this model by introducing a revised model with newly developed sub-categories under the five revised key categories of adversity, resilience processes, outcomes, internal resources, and external resources. Conclusions The results provide evidence for the development of resilience-based interventions and services for spousal caregivers in their contexts.
