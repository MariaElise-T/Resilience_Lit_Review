The recent proliferation of applications of mindfulness in different fields of psychology, including its use in coaching psychology, has been noted and questions have been raised regarding transfer of concepts and issues of competence. As a psychologist who has been using mindfulness-based input over the past two decades, it seems an opportune time to continue a practice-based discussion on the use of mindfulness in the area of coaching psychology. In particular, to consider ways in which mindfulness inputs facilitate the development of resilience in managing issues arising in working life. This has wide relevance for applied psychologists in the area of executive coaching.
