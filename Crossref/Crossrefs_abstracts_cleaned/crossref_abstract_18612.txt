AbstractThis paper studies H∞ output quantized control for networked control systems (NCSs) under resilient event‐triggered mechanism (ETM) and aperiodic denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks. First, by integrating attack information into triggering conditions, an output‐based resilient ETM is introduced. Second, a switched system model is established, which integrates impacts of aperiodic jammer, resilient ETM, quantization, and disturbances into a unified framework. Third, less conservative exponential stability criteria are obtained with guaranteed H∞ performance. Further, sufficient conditions for co‐designing dynamic output feedback controller and resilient ETM are presented. Finally, an example confirms effectiveness of the proposed methods.
