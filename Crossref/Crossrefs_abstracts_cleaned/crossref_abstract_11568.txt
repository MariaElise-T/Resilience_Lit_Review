Abstract
Developments of technology and digitization encourage more efficient and integrated regional and city management through the smart city concept. The concept covers various aspects, such as environmental, economic, and social, including disaster management. West Java is known as a province with high disaster risk in Indonesia. There are various types of hazards and the average annual frequency is approaching 1,200 disasters. Comprehensive management is required to minimize losses also to build disaster resiliency. West Java Province has begun moving towards digitization of disaster management, integrated with the West Java Command Center, within the scope of the West Java Resilience Culture Province concept. This research will focus on reviewing the component of disaster management digitization in the context of a smart city, and its influence on building provinces with a resilient culture. In establishing a smart and resilient province, a development strategy covering all phases of disaster is vital, not only for emergency response but also for mitigation and rehabilitation. Further development is required, covering infrastructure, technology, and collaboration to achieve a higher level of resilience in West Java.
