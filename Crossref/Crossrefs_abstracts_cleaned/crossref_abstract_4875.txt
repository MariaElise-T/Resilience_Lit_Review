Abstract
As different governments have assumed power in Zambia since the democratic tide that swept across Africa in the early 1990s, the conundrum of a free press continues to complicate governance and journalistic practices. This study investigated how members of Parliament (MPs) felt about press freedom. A survey administered to current MPs, which had a response rate of 52%, revealed that almost 95% (94.6%, n=70) agreed or strongly agreed that press freedom in Zambia should be increased. A parallel measure of questionnaire reliability asked Parliamentarians to respond to the statement, Press freedom in Zambia should be decreased. The majority 81.1% (n=60) disagreed or strongly disagreed. The study’s overall results indicate that there is an awareness of the importance of press freedom among the MPs, but there appears to be a reluctance – rather than resilience – to implement changes that would provide for a freer press system.
