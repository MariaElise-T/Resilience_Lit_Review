The wealth of research on the value and psychological importance of parenting support and education is very positive (Buchannan, 1999; RCPCH 2002). However the evidence suggests that too few families from refugee backgrounds are accessing such services. This paper explores how educational psychologists can begin to address this imbalance to promote the emotional wellbeing and resilience of refugee parents. This is examined via an overview of parenting support available, within the current socio-political context. Approaches that foster non-pathology, mutual respect, shared learning, empowerment and advocacy are then discussed. Finally case study examples of inclusive practice specifically tailored to meet the needs of refugee parents are described and the need for targeted outreach support is promoted.
