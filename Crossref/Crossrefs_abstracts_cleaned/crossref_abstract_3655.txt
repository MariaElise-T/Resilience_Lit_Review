Modern generation trend through renewable energy-based distributed energy resources has made microgrids an important part of the power system. Robust control of the inverter providing quality power has become an essential microgrid (MG) requirement. This paper proposes continuous control set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) on inverter for dynamic voltage regulation supplying reactive power to the load for a MG. The proposed method uses the terminal voltage magnitude, which reduces calculation time, sensor per phase, and the engagement burden of the controller. This paper applies a nonlinear VSI model and a series parallel structure nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model of artificial neural network (ANN) to predict future output which CCS-MPC optimizes. The proposed VSI with CCS MPC is applied to a case study of a real system as a plug-and-play device. Simulation shows the satisfactory result of the proposed controller. The inverter control system has been made resilient to protect itself and automatically recover from faults on the DC and AC side, providing quality power to its local load when the fault has been removed.
