The COVID-19 epidemic has caused dramatic impacts and changes in the tourism industry, and job insecurity and emotional exhaustion have created psychological stress and negative emotions. Social support for Taiwan tourism workers (travel agency, transportation industry, lodging industry, tourism and leisure industry, etc.) plays an important role in their career resilience. However, not all of the potential social support moderators have a critical impact. This study used PLS-SEM analysis to survey 373 respondents by using an online questionnaire to investigate the critical influence of social support on the spread of COVID-19 using career motivation theory. In addition to the direct relationship between the individualâ€™s psychological resilience and social support, the strategy of social support (family and friends, national relief policies and workplace support) is also pointed out. The results of the study illustrate the effectiveness of workplace support in combating the epidemic. This study provides information on effective resistance to the epidemic, how to prolong career resilience during unexpected shocks and stresses, and how to understand the mechanisms of adaptation or resilience in adversity and complements the study of factors and literature base in resilience research. It is also used as a study of the impact factors and industry strategy planning in future research.
