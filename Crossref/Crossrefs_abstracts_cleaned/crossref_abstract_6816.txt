<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 who commit crimes so that they must take responsibility for their actions by undergoing guidance at the </em>Lembaga Pembinaan Khusus Anak <em>(LPKA) are called juvenile offender. Juvenile offenders, who are adolescents in their developmental period, certainly experience pressures caused by various changes in environmental conditions that they must face while serving a sentence in the LPKA. Therefore, a juvenile offender must have resilience. This study aims to examine whether there is an influence between self-esteem and resilience in foster children in LPKA. The participants of this study were 132 juvenile offenders consisting of 64 juvenile offenders of LPKA X and 68 juvenile offenders of LPKA Y. The research data were collected by distributing questionnaires of Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Resilience Quotient (RQ) measuring instruments. The hypotheses were tested using the simple linear regression method. The test results show that self-esteem positively and significantly influences foster children's resilience in LPKA by 20.2%, p = 0.00 &lt;0.05.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Keywords: </em></strong><em>Self-esteem; Resilience; Juvenile offenders</em></p>
