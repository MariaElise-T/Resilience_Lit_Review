Against the backdrop of today's increasingly frequent financial crises and cyclical economic fluctuations, economic resilience has become a hot topic in the field of regional research. This article will conduct in-depth research on the current situation of regional economic resilience development in China. This study will start from the perspective of enhancing regional economic resilience. This article constructs a relatively comprehensive evaluation index system in the research. At the same time, the author uses the entropy weighted TOPSIS method to scientifically measure the level of regional economic resilience. Based on the measurement, the development status of each province from 2012 to 2012 is comprehensively evaluated. Finally, a comprehensive analysis is conducted on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the evolution of regional economic resilience. The results of the study found that the overall level of economic resilience in China is steadily increasing. Among them, most regions have enormous potential for improvement, and regional differences are gradually narrowing.
