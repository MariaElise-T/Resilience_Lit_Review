The safe and efficient function of critical national infrastructure (CNI) relies on the accurate demand forecast. Cyber-physical system-based demand forecasting systems (CDFS), typically found in CNI (such as energy, water, and transport), are highly vulnerable to being compromised under false data injection attacks (FDIAs). The problem is that the majority of existing CDFS employ anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AIDS) to combat FDIAs. Since the distribution of demand time series keeps changing naturally with time, AIDS treat a major change in the distribution as an attack, but this approach is not effective against colluding FDIAs. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel resilient CDFS called PRDFS (Proposed Resilient Demand Forecasting System). The primary novelty of PRDFS is that it uses signature-based intrusion detection systems (SIDS) that automatically generate attack signatures through the game-theoretic approach for the early detection of malicious nodes. We simulate the performance of PRDFS under colluding FDIA on High Performance Computing (HPC). The simulation results show that the demand forecasting resilience of PRDFS never goes below 80%, regardless of the percentage of malicious nodes. In contrast, the resilience of the benchmark system decreases sharply from about 99% to less than 30%, over the simulation period as the percentage of malicious nodes increases.
