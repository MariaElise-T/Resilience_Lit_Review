The increase in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters in recent years require new methods and tools to deal with this change. New approaches must be developed to ensure the safety of cities and settled communities from these events. Implementing the resilience of a territory requires an integrated approach to act simultaneously on physical, economic and social reality. The described research had investigated on possible tools to really improve physical and social dimension. Resilience is assumed as a paradigm within the project for the construction/transformation of the built environment. Is highlighted the fundamental role of the social component in determining priorities and security issues for each specific context. Physical and social environment are characterized, therefore, as an inseparable dyad for any action aimed at strengthening the resilience and safety of the environment built. In the implementation process of the resilience of an urban system, two closely interrelated areas are identified: for one, the community capability of implementing organizational-procedural adaptability; contrary, the physical space and the natural dimension, as a place of construction of the technological-spatial convertibility, and the ecological and environmental responsiveness. Among the several conditions to ensure adequate levels of connection and correlation with ecological factors, topological, social and technological developments of the built environment, in this paper are described those related to risk communication as fundamental first tool.
