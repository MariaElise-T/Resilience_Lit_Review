 Cross-cultural workers are often exposed to a host of environmental, interpersonal, and physical stressors. This exposure may lead to negative mental health outcomes such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, or sub-clinical psychological distress. This study sought to investigate risk and resilience factors, both broadly and in-depth, among a group of faith-based cross-cultural workers. An adapted Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory, 2nd edition (DRRI-2) along with the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD–RISC) were administered to N=268 missionaries and faith-based humanitarian aid workers. A comprehensive correlational analysis revealed significant relationships to risk and resilience in the areas of pre-field preparation, negative family events while on the field, and pre-field negative events. Implications for member care are discussed.
