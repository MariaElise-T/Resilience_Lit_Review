AbstractMuch attention in recent years has been focused on the idea of replacing patchworks of public policies in specific issue areas with more coordinated or ‘integrated’ policy strategies (IS). Empirical work on such strategies, however, shows the remarkable resilience of pre-existing policy elements, often leading to policy failures and other sub-optimal outcomes in policy reform efforts. Case studies of Integrated Land Management (ILM) reform efforts in Western Canada reveal the continuing problems pre-existing clientelistic political arrangements cause for governments attempting to replace sector-specific plans with more integrated frameworks.
