AbstractObjectiveThis study aimed to develop a Resilience Scale for Parents of Children with Cancer (RSP‐CC) designed specifically for parents of children with cancer and to evaluate its psychometric properties.MethodsBased on the Resilience Model for Families of Children with Cancer, items were created after an extensive literature review and evaluated through expert consultation and a pilot study. Psychometric evaluation was conducted with the parents of 601 children with cancer in the pediatric hematology oncology services of different hospitals in the Ankara and Kayseri provinces in Turkey.ResultsA 4‐factor structure was illustrated by exploratory factor analysis and confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, explaining 62.192% of the total variance. In the reliability analysis of the scale, Interclass correlation = 0.993 and Cronbach's alpha = 0.994 were found for the scale. Robust correlation coefficients were found between test‐retest, and the correlation between the two measurements was statistically significant (r = 0.990; p ˂ 0.001). As a result, the validity of a 24‐item scale structure consisting of 4 dimensions was validated.ConclusionsIt may be said that the RSP‐CC meets the necessary criteria to examine the resilience in parents of children aged 0–18 with a cancer diagnosis, and its psychometric properties are reasonable sufficient.
