The data were collected using marital satisfaction Enrique's Persian Questionnaire, Connor Davidson Resilience Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistic and linear regression with stepwise method in SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, and version 16.
Results: The results showed that the resilience (β = 0.80, p <0.001) and mental health (β = -0.14, p <0.001) were predictors of marital satisfaction. These variables explained 78% of variance in marital satisfaction in the elderly (P<0.001).
Conclusion: The study showed that resilience and mental health have closed relationship with marital satisfaction in the elderly. Therefore, it should help to improve the marital satisfaction and having a successful aging in the elderly by conducting educational interventions to increase resilience and promote mental health.
