COVID 19 closed the people in their homes but for a small part of the society the period of isolation has passed in a learning and office environment. What are the effects of the social isolation on people – we will find out. How the environment – parents, friends, society, colleagues, influences on the successful dealing with stress and how it helps personal sustainability, we will know in the future. During the research we will see the dynamics in the resilience levels of the cadets before, during and after the quarantine. The results will show us how the military environment helps the cadets to deal with the negative sides of the social isolation. The development of resilience will be monitored as an ability of selfregulation in a moments of crisis.
