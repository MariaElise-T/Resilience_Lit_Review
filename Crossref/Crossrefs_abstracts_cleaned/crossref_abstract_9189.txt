Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) empowers learners to take informed decisions and responsible actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society, while respecting cultural diversity. Professor Yuto Kitamura, Graduate School of Education, University
 of Tokyo, Japan, is investigating how ESD affects the perception, consciousness and attitude of students and teachers. The goal is to develop a common framework and indicators to effectively monitor and assess the impacts of ESD at the school and institution level. Research at the Center for
 Advanced School Education and Evidence-based Research (CASEER) entitled 'Strengthening Social Resilience through Education for Sustainable Development-Building a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and improvement mechanism' is seeking to enhance the quantity and quality of ESD. To do this,
 Kitamura and the team are exploring education policies in developing countries, with a focus on Southeast Asia where countries are starting to recognise the importance of ESD but have yet to implement them sufficiently. Therefore, the research of Kitamura and the team can assist with effectively
 incorporating ESD into teaching and learning activities. It will also help with monitoring and evaluating the impacts of ESD, which is something with which some countries in Southeast Asia are struggling. The goal of the research is to present a standard model consisting of a set of indicators
 and a questionnaire survey that can shed light on the present situation as well as future developments. When being implemented, the model can be modified according to the country and society in question.
