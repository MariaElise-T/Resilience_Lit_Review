This study aimed to investigate the effects of optimism and self-esteem on resilience in university students. A total of 127 university students were surveyed on optimism, self-esteem, and resilience. The collected data were analyzed using a t-test, one-way ANOVA, correlation analysis, and multilevel multiple regression analysis. The results of this study are as follows: First, university students displayed a statistically significant positive correlation between optimism, self-esteem, and resilience. Second, the factors that most significantly affected resilience in college student were self-esteem (β = .59, p < .001) and optimism (β = .25, p = .001). and these factors explained 62.5% of resilience. Through this study, we looked for approaches to enhance optimism and self-esteem and ultimately improve resilience in university students. It is hoped that this study will be used I meaningfully in follow-up research.
