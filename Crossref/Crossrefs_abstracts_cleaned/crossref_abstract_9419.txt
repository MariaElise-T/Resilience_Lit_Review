 Greater attention to teen mothers’ strengths and aspirations has generated interest in their resilience. An integrative review of the research was undertaken to determine how teen mothers’ resilience, risks, and protective factors are conceptualized across methodological approaches. In total, 10 databases were searched in 2021 to identify relevant studies. Of the 32 studies meeting criteria, the majority were conducted in the United States. Qualitative studies mined teen mothers’ accounts for resilient processes, adversities, and protective factors while quantitative studies operationalized variables based on the resilience framework. The studies in this review present a more balanced and contextual perspective on teen mothers and suggest broader notions of their competence, success, and vulnerabilities. Several studies draw attention to the potential costs of resilience and the heterogeneity of teen mothers. Unfortunately, this research shows little cross-fertilization across methods. Implications of the findings for future research, policy, and practice are described.
