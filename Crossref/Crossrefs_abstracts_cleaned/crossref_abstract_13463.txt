Background: Home enteral nutrition (HEN) is a lifesaving therapy that provides benefits along with countless challenges. This qualitative study examined how HEN consumers learned to cope successfully with HEN‐related challenges and uncovered how healthcare providers could help foster the process of coping in other HEN consumers. Methods: Twelve adult HEN consumers who perceived that they were coping successfully and overcoming the adversity associated with HEN, and met the criteria for resilience using the Resilience Scale, self‐selected for the study. Participants engaged in a series of 2 in‐depth interviews. Data were coded and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Results: One overarching theme and 5 main categories emerged from the data, revealing that these individuals coped successfully with HEN by developing an attitude of personal responsibility to accept new life conditions, take charge of their own well‐being, seek and accept support, maximize independence and normality, and focus on the positive. In addition, these participants used a variety of problem‐ and emotion‐focused coping strategies and shared resilient characteristics such as self‐efficacy and perseverance. Conclusions: Implications for clinical practice and HEN education, along with suggestions for healthcare providers to foster coping with HEN are provided. An educational manual with self‐help suggestions for adult HEN consumers is also available at http://www.copingwell.com.
