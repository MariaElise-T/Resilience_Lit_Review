AbstractThe aim of the current study was to examine the role of resilience in the victimization experiences of students and their subjective well‐being as well as to explore gender and age‐related effects. Initially, 558 students (52.15% male) from grades 6 to 10 participated in the study completing The Student Aggression and Victimization Questionnaire, The Mental Health Continuum, and the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale. One‐hundred and twenty‐seven (22.8%) students were excluded from the final analysis, as they did not report any victimization experience during the past 3 months. Males in all year levels reported higher levels of well‐being and resilience compared with females. No gender differences were found in victimization experiences. Languishing students were found to be at higher risk of experiencing serious victimization. Resilience was not found to moderate the effects of victimization on mental health, but a higher level of resilience appeared to be related to more positive well‐being for boys and younger students. Limitations of the study and implications for anti‐bullying interventions are briefly discussed.
