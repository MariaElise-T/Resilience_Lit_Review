Narrow tolerances are commonly used to control uncertainty in the production of technicalcomponents. However, narrow tolerances lead to financial expense and limit flexibility. In this paperthe concept of a resilient process chain is presented. This concept covers the product life cycle phases ofproduction and usage. It is enabled by the digitalization in mechanical engineering and offers access tovariable process windows instead of rigid tolerances. First steps of this concept are then applied to the TU Darmstadt active air spring. The active air spring can be used to increase the driving comfort in avehicle or, for instance, to minimize kinetosis during autonomous driving. The focus hereby is toidentify possible production influences on the behaviour of the components usage. For this purpose, theactuator of the active air spring is specifically manufactured with typical uncertainty of high precisionmachining of the bore and characterized experimentally in a test rig. The results show an influenceof the production on the efficiency of the actuator. The measurements are fundamental to establish aresilient process chain on the active air spring.
