AbstractCultivation of resilience is believed to ameliorate mental health problems. The impact of mental health problems on resilience is however rarely discussed. This study investigated the reciprocal relationship of resilience with depression and anxiety symptoms using a three‐wave cross‐lagged design. Resilience level, depression, and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline, the third and the sixth month in 125 university students without psychiatric disorders (62 females). No significant changes in resilience levels were observed across the 6 months. Depressive symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms significantly increased at the third and sixth months compared with baseline. The three‐wave cross‐lagged models revealed an unstable reciprocal relationship of resilience with depression and a stable reciprocal relationship between resilience and anxiety symptoms over time. The reciprocal relationship between resilience and mental health problems indicates the importance of cultivating resilience for the prevention of mental illness as well as the importance of managing mental health symptoms at non‐clinical levels for monitoring resilience. The unstable reciprocal relationship between resilience and depression symptoms across time suggests the existence of potential moderators that impact the relationship between resilience and depression. Our findings further support the notion that resilience is conceptualized as a dynamic process.
