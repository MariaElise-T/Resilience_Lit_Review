IntroductionPreventing burnout and promoting resilience are important to the well-being of health care professionals and the quality of patient care. Indeed, it’s a promising way to mitigate the negative effects of stressors and allow professional growth.Objectivesstudy the association between job satisfaction and resilience in medical interns and residents.MethodsAs part of a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, interns and medical residents completed an online self-questionnaire using ’Google Forms’. It collected socio-demographic data and assessed the level of job satisfaction using a 5-point Likert-type scale for each item. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to assess the level of resilience.ResultsThe total number of participants was 56, of which 64.3% were medical residents.75% of the participants worked in a medical department and most had a number of shifts per month ≥4. The average years of practice was 2.27±1.23 years. Participants expressed dissatisfaction at work with salary (69.6%), task allocation and organization (66.1%), availability of resources (66.1%), comfort (57.1%), safety (53.6%) and supervision (50%). Referring to the BRS scale, higher resilience scores were objectified in male participants (p=0.002). The level of resilience decreased with the number of years of practice (p=0.039). Good satisfaction by management and recognition at work could enhance the level of resilience (p=0.029 and p=0.043 respectively).ConclusionsThe results of our study suggest that dissatisfaction with work-related aspects may influence the level of resilience. These results deserve special attention to improve job satisfaction and preserve resilience.DisclosureNo significant relationships.
