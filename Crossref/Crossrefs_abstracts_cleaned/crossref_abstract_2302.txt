Multi-microgrids (MMGs) revolutionize integrating and managing diverse distributed energy resources (DERs), significantly enhancing the overall efficiency of energy systems. Unlike traditional power systems, MMGs comprise interconnected microgrids that operate independently or collaboratively. This innovative concept adeptly addresses challenges posed by pulsed load effects, capitalizing on the cooperative nature of interconnected microgrids. A coordinated MMG system effectively redistributes and shares the impact of pulsed loads, mitigating voltage fluctuations and ensuring sustained system stability. The proposed cooperative MMG scheme optimizes power distribution and load prioritization, facilitating the seamless allocation of surplus energy from neighboring microgrids to meet sudden surges in demand. This study focuses on DC standalone multi-microgrid systems, showcasing their inherent adaptability, resilience, and operational efficiency in managing pulse, variable, and unpredictable generation deficits. Several experiments on a laboratory-scale DC multi-microgrid validate the systemâ€™s robust performance. Notably, transient current fluctuations during pulse loads are promptly stabilized through the effective collaboration of microgrids. Variable load experiments reveal distinct behaviors, shedding light on the profound influence of control strategies. This research reveals the transformative potential of MMGs in addressing energy challenges, with a particular focus on DC standalone multi-microgrid systems. The findings underscore the adaptability and resilience of the proposed cooperative scheme, marking a significant stride in the evolution of modern power systems.
