The concept of resiliency is looked upon differently in the Western world. It is a concept that is applied to everything such as from not making it to a professional sports league to not being able to win a first place in any competition, or to not being able to obtain a dream job. The Western countries tend to apply the concept of resiliency to different tenets of their cultures and societies (Reich, Zautra, & Hall, 2010). While it is used to describe less life impacting issues, resiliency is a concept that is utilized to describe individuals overcoming life altering events such as terrorism, mass shootings, and physical or sexual assault. Each of us possesses either risk or protective factors that affect our ability to cope and be resilient in life. Risk and protective factors range from genetic to environmental factors. This article employs a meta-analysis review of literature knowledge to explore the concept of resiliency and how adverse events can influence protective and risk factors by making use of the concept of resiliency. In this article, the authors accept the Reich et al., 2010 definition of resiliency, as being able to adapt and overcome adversity and how current methods of treatment may influence protective factors. An array of professionals in practice employing current treatment modalities argue that one builds resilience through self-reflection, by identifying their relationships, and environmental factors (Reich et al., 2010).
