Abstract
Attachment and resilience are crucial in parent–child interaction. In this study, we investigated the effect of a mindful parenting program on the attachment of deaf children and the resilience of their hearing mothers. The present study was a semi-randomized controlled trial design. Thirty mothers with deaf children were randomly selected from Deaf School in Tehran, Iran. They were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups. The intervention group participated in an eight-session mindful parenting program, while the control group did not participate in this program. Both groups completed the Kinship Center Attachment Questionnaire and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using the repeated measures analysis of variance test. The results showed that the intervention significantly and positively influenced the attachment of deaf children and resilience in their mothers in the post-test, and the persistence of this effect was maintained in the follow-up stage (p &lt; .001). This study suggests that mindful parenting can promote attachment of deaf children and resilience in their mothers. In addition, the mothers attested to the social validity of the program.
