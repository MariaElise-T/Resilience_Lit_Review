Several research on the topic of supply chain resilience and sustainability have been done in recent years. However, they make clear that there are various points of view when it comes to the sustainability-resilience relationship. To adapt supply chains (SC) to the needs of contemporary manufacturing processes, new trends and approaches in environmental protection and social welfare have been put into place. Even though sustainability and resilience have each been extensively examined separately, there aren't many concepts that combine them to determine supply chain performance. Therefore, this study is displaying the aspects of supply chain resilience and how it may affect sustainability triple bottom line. Moreover, this study presents an extension of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), α-Discounting multi-criteria decision-making (α-D MCDM) to evaluate the resilience aspects in more consistent manner. This study proposes an idea of utilization of α-D MCDM in different manner to solve several supply chain evaluation issues.
