This paper investigated the influence of entrepreneurial competency and financial literacy on sustainable small enterprise performance. We simultaneously investigated the mediating role of entrepreneurial resilience on the association between competence and financial literacy with sustainable business performance. We used a quantitative method for collecting data from 220 small business entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. The collected data were analysed with the help of PLS-SEM. The results reveal that financial literacy significantly positively affects entrepreneurial competency and resilience. Entrepreneurial competency has a significant positive effect on Saudi SMEsâ€™ entrepreneurial resilience and sustainable performance. Finally, entrepreneurial resilience was simultaneously found to have a considerable impact on sustainable performance while mediating the effect of financial literacy and competency on sustainable performance across Saudi SMEs. In line with Saudi Vision 2030, with its profound focus on entrepreneurship and developing a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this research contributes to creating economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs managing small enterprises. Apart from extending the body of knowledge, this research can support policymakers in formulating relevant strategies to encourage SMEs that have been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to perform sustainably. Several other implications for financial institutions and entrepreneurs have also been drawn.
