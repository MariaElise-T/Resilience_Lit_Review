Symptomatic expression of emotional or interpersonal maladjustment especially in children is called a behavioral problem (Merriam Webster). Such problems include nail-biting, enuresis, negativism, or overt hostile or antisocial acts). These problems are studied to lesser extent & exist lower in report as compared to drugs & alcohol consumption but place an individual life into chaos. By applying positive attributes like resilience, self esteem & social support behavioral problems can be reduced.  Present study was carried out with aims 1) To find out the relation between resilience, self esteem, social support & behavioral problems of adolescents 2) To explore the gender differences in resilience, social support & self-esteem of adolescents. 3)  To examine the effect of age group on behavioral problems in adolescents. A sample of one  hundred  high school students (50 male + 50 female) of 1X and X grade in age range of 15-18 yrs were selected randomly  for the study. Tools used were, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Rosenbergâ€™s Scale, Interpersonal support evaluation list, ISEL & Behavioral Problem Checklist given by Achenbach in 2001.

Except for relationship between self-esteem & behavioral problems all results were found to be significant.Age differences on the measures of resilience, self-esteem, social support & behavioral problems were found to be insignificant
