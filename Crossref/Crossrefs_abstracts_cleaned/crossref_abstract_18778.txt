AbstractChina suffers from frequent large-scale earthquakes, posing a significant challenge to the development and integrity of its rural water supply system (RWSS). The earthquake resilience of water supply systems is understood to be a function of multifaceted factors, which are time- and space-dependent. Measuring the seismic-resilience of RWSS in China remains a challenge. This paper proposes a multi-stage comprehensive evaluation framework, focusing on the relationship between multi-dimensional factors and the seismic- resilience of RWSS in rural areas, across three stages: before, during and after earthquake events. This study comprises four steps: (1) Development of a multi-stage evaluation conceptual framework; (2) identification of seismic-resilience factors; (3) verification of the relationships between factors and stages; and (4) formation of the final evaluation framework. The relationship between multi-dimensional factors is confirmed by a method of triangulation through the quantitative analysis of PLS-SEM combined with the qualitative literature analysis, highlighting the causal approach of the resilience of RWSSs, so as to better understand the resilience state of each stage of disaster. Understanding these factors and their influence on the seismic capacity of RWSS will enable local authorities to recognize the existing advantages and disadvantages of these factors, so as to carry out better resilience practice in all stages of disasters.
