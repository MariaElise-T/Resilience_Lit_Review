 The current study examined how first responders and the general population described the concept of resilience. Categories of resilience were coded a priori using Stemlerâ€™s content analysis. For the general population, positive coping was the most frequently occurring category followed by social support and adaptability. The next most frequently occurring terms were societal resources and personal competence. Consistent with the general population, first responders described resilience most frequently with positive coping. Social support was the next most frequently occurring category, followed by personal competence, perseverance, emotional regulation, and physical fitness. Although both the general population and first responder participants highlighted the importance of having a support network, first responders suggested that dealing with traumatic experiences was more of an individual process, and seeking professional help was not common practice. Implications for mental health professionals and future directions for research are offered.
