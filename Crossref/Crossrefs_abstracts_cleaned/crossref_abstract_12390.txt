Abstract
The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is currently causing challenges and opportunities in all sectors worldwide. The logistic industry plays an enormous role in keeping the countries functional, and it accounts for 13.4 % of the total GDP in Thailand. This article aims to identify and justify critical success factors for the Logistic Industries experiencing success and failure during the pandemic. The research was conducted using semi-structured interviews with top managers of three companies from March to September 2021, which is phase 4 of the pandemic. The findings we analysed using thematic analysis to understand the critical factors within the industry. Logistics companies of different sizes were selected for this purpose as case studies aimed to identify the resemblance of the effects and find the relationship with company resilience. Five key supporting factors were identified for the logistics firms to be resilient during the pandemic, including flexibility, Business Continuity Plan, market diversification, IT systems, and leadership.
