Background The issue of burnout syndrome among health discipline students is gaining heightened attention due to its serious effects, which causes them to have the intention to quit. Despite this, limited studies are available on the extent of burnout and its association with resilience and intention to drop out among clinical-level nursing students. Objective To explore the relationship between burnout, resilience, and intention to quit among nursing students. Methods An online questionnaire was used to conduct a cross-sectional study, targeting nursing students at the clinical level through a nonprobability sample. The participants were required to provide their sociodemographic, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data was analyzed using descriptive, inferential, and correlation tests. Results The study included a group of 564 nursing students and interns, the majority of whom were female at a percentage of 78.9%. Among this group, 65% experienced a high level of burnout, with 42% experiencing emotional exhaustion, 54% experiencing depersonalization (DP), and 77% reporting low personal achievement. A total of 48% of clinical-level students were considering quitting the nursing program. Moreover, the students reported low scores of resilience, with negative correlations observed with DP ( r = −.12, p = .04) and positive correlation with low personal achievement ( r = .43, p < .001). Conclusion Nursing students and interns faced a significant amount of burnout and showed a desire to drop out nursing program. Their level of resilience was moderately low, and it correlated with burnout subscales DP and personal accomplishment. A collaborative intervention is needed to promote resiliency and alleviate burnout symptoms during clinical training.
