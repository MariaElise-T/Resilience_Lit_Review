AbstractBackground and AimsResilience is a process that enables people to control the stressors of their lives. During the COVID‐19 crisis, work stress increased among prehospital emergency technicians. So, it was possible to reduce their resilience. This study aimed to investigate the changes in the prehospital emergency technicians' resilience during the pandemic of COVID‐19.MethodsA cross‐sectional study was conducted at the prehospital emergency department in Qazvin province. For 6 months, 234 emergency technicians participated in this study. Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire and the emergency medical services resilience scale (EMSRS).ResultsThe Friedman test indicated no significant difference between the mean scores of EMS employees' resilience during 6 months (p > 0.05). However, the correlation matrix between the scores of EMSRS during 6 months indicated that the resilience scores of EMS employees were positively correlated during the study (p < 0.01).ConclusionsThe EMS technicians' resilience was almost constant and moderate during the 6 months of care for patients with COVID‐19 and their transfer to the hospital, indicating that the COVID‐19 crisis could suppress the emergency medical technicians ability to increase resilience.
