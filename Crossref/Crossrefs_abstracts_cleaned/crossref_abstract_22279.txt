Ion-adsorption rare earth mining areas are located in southern Chinaâ€™s ecologically fragile red soil hills region. For a long time, under the influence of multiple factors such as low mining technology and indiscriminate mining, this area has experienced serious environmental problems. Therefore, it is crucial for the ecological management and restoration of mining areas to accurately conduct a quantitative evaluation of ecological restoration status. We used remote sensing and geographic information data to establish an ecosystem resilience evaluation index system consisting of five criteria (land stress, vegetation conditions, surface conditions, biodiversity, and air pollution) and 17 evaluation factors. The Lingbei rare earth mining area in Dingnan County in the red soil hill region was used as a case study since it is a representative ion adsorption rare earth mining area. The restoration status of the mining area was evaluated from 2000 to 2020. The results showed the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the ecological resilience level of the mining area was 0.695, 0.685, 0.664, 0.651, and 0.657, exhibiting a decrease followed by an increase. (2) Spatially, the ecological resilience was low at the mine site and increased with increasing distance, indicating that rare earth mining adversely affected ecological resilience in the mining area. (3) The regional ecological resilience has improved over time due to the implementation of green development policies. However, the rate of improvement is slow and ecological restoration of mining areas will remain an ongoing challenge in the future. This study can provide a scientific basis and practical reference for the ecological protection and restoration of mining areas.
