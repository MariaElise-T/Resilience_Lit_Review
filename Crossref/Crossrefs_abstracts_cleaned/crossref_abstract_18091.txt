This study is part of a multicentric youth project conducted by Association of Adolescent and Child Care in India (AACCI).We examined resilience and its association with demographic variables like age, sibling status, academic course, engagementin extracurricular activities, perceived internet/social media usage and dependence, substance use and perception of controlover oneâ€™s life. We used a cross-sectional design with a sample of 17- to 21-year-old female college students from Delhi. Wefound that students who perceived control over their lives had high total scores on resilience measures. Students who usedsocial media had higher total and relational resilience than those who did not use social media. Students who did notuse social media had higher individual resilience. Those who did not see themselves as dependent on social media hadhigher total resilience and relational resilience. Those who did not see themselves as dependent on the internet had higherrelational resilience. There were no significant relationships between resilience and the other demographic variables. Resultsfrom the current study shed light on factors contributing to resilience among adolescents. We can use these findings todevelop training programs that promote adolescent well-being
