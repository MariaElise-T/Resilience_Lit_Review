Adolescents with a history of cancer frequently engage in risk behaviors. The purpose of this correlational study was to explore factors that affect decision making and risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use) of cancer-surviving adolescents. A sample of 52 teen survivors participated at two cancer centers. In addition to a medical record review and IQ testing, several psychosocial measures were administered in a semistructured interview with the teen survivor. Three antecedent factors (cognitive function, resiliency, and role modeling of risk behaviors by parents and peers) were examined in a hierarchical regression model to predict decision making. These same factors, with an additional mediating variable (decision making), were examined in a hierarchical logistic regression model to predict risk behaviors in teen survivors. In the decision-making model, adjusted for demographic covariates, resiliency was a marginally significant predictor of decision making. As nonresiliency increases, quality of decision making may decrease for teen survivors. In the model to predict risk behaviors, four factors (cognitive function, resiliency, role modeling, and decision making) were added to the basic model, controlling for the same covariates. Resiliency and decision making were highly significant predictors of one or more risk behaviors. Nonresilient teen survivors with poor-quality decision making are more likely to engage in risk behaviors of substance use and need intervention that is aimed at improving decision-making skills to reduce these behaviors.
