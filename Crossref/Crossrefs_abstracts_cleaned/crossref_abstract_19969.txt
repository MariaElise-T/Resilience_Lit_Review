AbstractBackgroundDomestic violence against women is a hidden and global epidemic that has many negative effects. The COVID‐19 pandemic, quarantine, and staying at home can lead to violent and domestic violence against women. Due to the importance of the subject, the present study was conducted to investigate the coping strategies and resilience of women victims of domestic violence in the COVID‐19 epidemic in Tehran, 2020.MethodsThe present study is a descriptive‐analytical study on 420 women who suffered domestic violence in Tehran, 2020. Data collection tools included a demographic information form, socioeconomic status questionnaire, WHO standardized domestic violence questionnaire, Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, and Endler and Parker's coping strategies questionnaire. This study was based on the Internet and online. The research poster, the characteristics of the participants, the voluntary participation in the study, the confidentiality of the information, and the link to the online questionnaire were made public through Internet networks.ResultsThere was no correlation between resilience with general violence (p =.221), types of physical violence (p =.502), psychological violence (p =.178), and sexual violence (p =.386). The results also showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the women who were using or not using a problem‐oriented style with physical violence, using or not using an emotion‐oriented style with physical, psychological, sexual violence, and using or not using an avoidance style with physical violence among the samples (p < .05).ConclusionThe use of coping strategies leads to a reduction in domestic violence against women during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Therefore, designing and implementing training programs to improve coping styles in women can be effective in dealing with such stressful situations and help prevent injuries caused by violence.
