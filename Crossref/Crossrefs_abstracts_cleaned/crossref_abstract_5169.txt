Globally, disasters constantly challenge the capacity of humans to adapt to its consequences and endure the impact. It comprises a range of impacts including loss of life and properties, risk of mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, grief, anxiety etc. The disaster risk relies upon the individualâ€™s exposure to disaster vulnerability and resilience. It also includes the needs of a vulnerable population including older adults and the presence of secondary stressors within the affected community. Therefore, older adults are found to be a highly vulnerable age group during every disaster. Especially in developing countries, older adults face numerous issues and challenges due to inadequate disaster infrastructure and response, which are often associated with poor quality of life outcomes.  The present study tries to conceptualize the significance of disaster vulnerability, resilience as a decisive factor for the quality of life (QoL) of older adults in the natural disaster. Further, the current study highlights the functional relationship between disaster phases, vulnerability, resilience, psychosocial factors and preparedness measures to ensure a better quality of life for older adults.
