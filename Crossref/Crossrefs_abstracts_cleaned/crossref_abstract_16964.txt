Purpose
This paper presents stress inoculation as a method for reducing executivesâ€™ stress and enhancing their resilience and performance.


Design/methodology/approach
A review of theory and research on executive stress, resilience, and stress inoculation training was conducted.


Findings
Across studies, stress inoculation training has yielded reductions in performance anxiety and state anxiety while improving performance under stress.


Practical implications
Stress inoculation training offers a highly customized and practical way for executives to design adaptive responses to the stressors they find particularly difficult.


Originality/value
Stress inoculation training traditionally has been applied in clinical settings and in extremely stressful settings (e.g., military, law enforcement). This article describes how this intervention may be applied within organizations as a needed addition to the complement of stress management approaches currently offered to executives.
