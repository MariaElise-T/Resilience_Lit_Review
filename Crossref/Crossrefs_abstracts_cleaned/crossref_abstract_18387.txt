Competent outcomes in late adolescence were examined in relation to adversity over time,
antecedent competence and psychosocial resources, in order to investigate the phenomenon of
resilience. An urban community sample of 205 (114 females, 90 males; 27% minority) children
were recruited in elementary school and followed over 10 years. Multiple methods and
informants were utilized to assess three major domains of competence from childhood through
adolescence (academic achievement, conduct, and peer social competence), multiple aspects of
adversity, and major psychosocial resources. Both variable-centered and person-centered
analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized significance of resources for resilience. Better
intellectual functioning and parenting resources were associated with good outcomes across
competence domains, even in the context of severe, chronic adversity. IQ and parenting appeared
to have a specific protective role with respect to antisocial behavior. Resilient adolescents (high
adversity, adequate competence across three domains) had much in common with their
low-adversity competent peers, including average or better IQ, parenting, and psychological
well-being. Resilient individuals differed markedly from their high adversity, maladaptive peers
who had few resources and high negative emotionality. Results suggest that IQ and parenting
scores are markers of fundamental adaptational systems that protect child development in the
context of severe adversity.
