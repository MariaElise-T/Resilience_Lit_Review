Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to study the role of task, relational and cognitive job crafting on the relationship between resiliency and meaningfulness in work.


Design/methodology/approach
This study used path analysis under the framework of structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses using a sample of 374 law enforcement employees.


Findings
Results from the analysis revealed a direct effect of resiliency on meaningfulness. This study also found that relational and cognitive crafting partially mediate these relationships.


Practical implications
Understanding the proactive strategies resilient employees can use to build meaning in work will help managers develop better training programs. The findings emphasize the importance of building social relations and positive reframing of work as a mechanism to bounce back from adverse circumstances.


Originality/value
This paper provides empirical evidence of the proactive actions resilient employees implement to build meaningfulness in work.
