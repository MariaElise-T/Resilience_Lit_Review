The age of respondents ranged between 16 and 17 years (M = 16.49; SD = 0.50). The Personal Growth Questionnaire, Resiliency Measurement Scale and Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire were used in the study.ResultsThe results of the analyses indicate that emotional intelligence is positively associated with personal growth and plays a mediating role in the relationship between resiliency and the occurrence of positive changes after experiencing negative life events, especially in terms of changes in relating to others and appreciation of life.ConclusionsWhen searching for factors determining the occurrence of positive consequences of experienced life events, their direct or indirect impact should be taken into account.
