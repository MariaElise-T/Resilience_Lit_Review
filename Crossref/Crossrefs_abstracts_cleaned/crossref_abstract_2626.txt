AbstractResilient wheels are well‐known for their contribution to prevent squealing, impact noise and dynamic stresses on unsprung masses. In this study, a FE model is established in ABAQUS to analyze the stiffness of resilient wheels based on the Mooney‐Rivlin hyperelastic material theory. The modes of each part in the resilient wheel and the whole wheel are calculated. The static and dynamic stiffness of the resilient wheel are analyzed. The simulation shows that the resilient wheel can reduce the dynamic loads both in the lateral and vertical directions between the vehicle and the track. (© 2016 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
