The article discusses the results of research in the field of critical infrastructure protection. The resilience research is aimed at creating a framework for the assessment of static resilience. The complexity of the solution should be given by the framework, which derives from the pillars of safety. The aim is to create technical prerequisites for a possible dynamic assessment of the resilience of critical infrastructure facilities.
