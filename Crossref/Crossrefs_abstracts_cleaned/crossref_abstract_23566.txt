Significance
Nano- and microarchitected materials to date have relied on additive manufacturing techniques to produce beam-, plate-, and shell-based architectures that achieve highly desired mechanical properties while being limited to low-throughput volumes as well as to periodic and symmetric designs that deteriorate if symmetry-breaking defects are present. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of nano-architected materials via scalable self-assembly processes with features that span across multiple scalesâ€”from nanometers to centimeters. Through experiments and simulations, we show that the smooth, doubly curved, shell-based geometries achieved through this process can surpass truss-based architectures in terms of energy absorption, stiffness-to-density response, and especially, mechanical resilience through an unprecedented combination of material size effects and optimal topology.
