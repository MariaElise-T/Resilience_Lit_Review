Abstract: The continuous supply of foods to the people across various localities is always a challenging task in normal conditions, whereas in case of pandemic situations like Covid 19 it becomes most difficult due to various factors impacting upon operational efficiency of the supply chain. In case of crisis situations the response of the system particularly food supply chain to serve the needs of the society was evaluated in this paper. The resiliency of supply chain in food sector was studied and accordingly related literature reviewed. Indian supply chain challenges are unique in nature due to its bio-diversity and geographic location. The methodology adopted to study this resiliency of Indian food supply chain was through available literature review, and study of data related to food supply chain. The resiliency of food supply chain was identified based on the results of price stabilization over period of time and availability of supplies during succeeding stages of Covid 19 pandemic. The synchronization of activities involved in SCM to create value for the customers through options like information reliability, Quality standard checkpoints, transportation flexibility, adoption of technology etc. were proposed.
