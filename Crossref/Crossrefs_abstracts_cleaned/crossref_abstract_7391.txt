Few studies have been conducted on the relationship between “outside-residing” resilience characteristics and the risk of developing drug use disorder later in life. These characteristics include responsive and caring parenting, household routines involving regular family meals and bedtime routines, social support from peers, participation in organized activities, and religious service attendance. We quantified the association between these resilience promotion factors during childhood and the risk of developing criteria for drug use disorder during adulthood using data from a retrospective cohort study of 618 adults born in Massachusetts during 1969-1983, including those with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Self-administered questionnaires gathered information on criteria for drug use disorder, ACEs, and family and community resilience promotion factors. Compared to individuals with “low” numbers of resilience promotion factors, 30% (95% CI: 0.5-0.9) and 50% reductions (95% CI: 0.4-0.8) in the risk of developing one or more criteria for drug use disorder were observed among those with “moderate” and “high” numbers of resilience factors, respectively (p value for trend=0.003). Overall, family factors were associated with greater risk reductions than comparable numbers of community factors. Among individuals with ACEs, a “high” number of family factors but not community factors were associated with a reduction in risk (RR:0.6, 95% CI:0.4-1.0 for family factors, RR:1.0, 95% CI:0.5-1.8 for community factors). These results suggest that the risk of developing criteria for drug use disorder decreases in a dose-response fashion according to the number of “outside-residing” resilience promotion factors during childhood, and that family factors are associated with greater risk reductions than community factors, particularly among individuals with ACEs. Coordinated prevention efforts at the family and community level are recommended to reduce the risk of this important societal problem.
