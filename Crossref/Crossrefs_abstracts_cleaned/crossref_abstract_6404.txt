Due to the globalization of Integrated Circuit (IC) design in the semiconductor industry and the outsourcing of chip manufacturing, Third-Party Intellectual Properties (3PIPs) become vulnerable to IP piracy, reverse engineering, counterfeit IC, and hardware trojans. To thwart such attacks, ICs can be protected using logic encryption techniques. However, strong resilient techniques incur significant overheads. Side-channel attacks (SCAs) further complicate matters by introducing potential attacks post fabrication. One of the most severe SCAs is power analysis (PA) attacks, in which an attacker can observe the power variations of the device and analyze them to extract the secret key. PA attacks can be mitigated via adding large extra hardware; however, the overheads of such solutions can render them impractical, especially when there are power and area constraints.
All Spin Logic Device (ASLD) is one of the most promising spintronic devices due to its unique properties: small area, no spin-charge signal conversion, zero leakage current, non-volatile memory, high density, low operating voltage, and its compatibility with conventional CMOS technology. In this article, we extend the work in Reference [1] on the usage of ASLD to produce secure and resilient circuits that withstand IC attacks (during the fabrication) and PA attacks (after fabrication), including reverse engineering attacks. First, we show that ASLD has another unique feature: identical power dissipation through the switching operations, where such properties can be effectively used to prevent PA and IC attacks. We then evaluate the proposed ASLD-based on performance overheads and security guarantees.
