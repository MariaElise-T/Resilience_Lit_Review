Abstract
Reliability-based design has been a widely used methodology in the design of engineering structures. For example, the structural design standards in many countries have adopted the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method. In recent years, the concept of resilience-based design has emerged, which additionally takes into account the posthazard functionality loss and recovery process of a structure. Under this context, the following questions naturally arise: can we establish a linkage between reliability-based design and resilience-based design? Does there exist a simple resilience-based design criterion that takes a similar form of LRFD? This paper addresses these questions, and the answer is “yes”. To this end, a new concept of structural resilience capacity is proposed, which is a generalization of structural load bearing capacity (resistance). The probabilistic characteristics (mean value, variance, probability distribution function) of resilience capacity are derived. Applying the concept of resilience capacity, this paper explicitly shows the relationship between the following four items: time-invariant reliability-, time-invariant resilience-, time-dependent reliability-, and time-dependent resilience-based design methods. Furthermore, an LRFD-like design criterion is proposed for structural resilience-based design, namely, load and resilience capacity factor design (LRCFD), whose applicability is demonstrated through an example. The LRCFD method can also be used, in conjunction with LRFD, to achieve reliability and resilience goals simultaneously of the designed structure.
