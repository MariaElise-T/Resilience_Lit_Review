Climate change has caused substantial losses, especially to smallholder farmers whose main source of livelihood is derived from agriculture. Climate change impacts can be reduced by enhancing coping and adaptation strategies. This study explores the coping and adaptation strategies of smallholder farming communities in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. As part of the assessment and analysis of drought, multiple sources of data were consulted, including 200 households’ socio-economic information, focus group discussions, and interviews. Extreme drought events are increasing, impacting negatively on smallholder farmers’ livelihoods. Adaptations to changing weather patterns were observed in smallholder farmers through planting early-maturing plants and drought-tolerant crops, altering planting dates, crop diversification, and irrigating in addition to non-farming activities. There is a need to enhance these context-based adaptation strategies to reduce risks and vulnerability and increase household resilience. Several socioeconomic developments and significant ecological deterioration appear to limit opportunities for long-term adaptation to drought.
