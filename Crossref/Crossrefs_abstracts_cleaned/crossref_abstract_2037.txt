 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a self-paced online resilience training program on promoting personal resilience and positive coping styles, while reducing the severity of anxiety- and depression-related symptoms, in a sample of BScN students ( N = 70) studying to become registered nurses. Using a repeated-measures research design, results indicate that scores on the measure of personal resilience significantly improved from baseline to post-training follow-up assessment. While scores on measures of positive coping and anxiety/depression shifted in the expected direction, these findings were not statistically significant. This study presents evidence to suggest that a self-paced online resilience training program may be an effective strategy for promoting personal resilience among nursing students.
