 Since the late 2000s, the concept of regional economic resilience has become the new buzzword in economic geography. Despite considerable attention, a common sentiment in the literature is that regional economic resilience is an underdeveloped and fuzzy concept. Therefore, this paper conducted a scoping review of 168 articles on the concept of regional economic resilience from 2000 to 2022 to assess its present conceptual state. The paper finds that the notion of regional economic resilience has become a well-developed concept and does not bear the markers of a fuzzy concept anymore. A conceptual framework is advanced.
