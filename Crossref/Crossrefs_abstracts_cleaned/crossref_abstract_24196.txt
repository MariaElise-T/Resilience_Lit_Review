Junctional proteins in cerebrovascular endothelial cells are essential for maintaining the barrier function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus protecting the brain from the infiltration of pathogens. The present study showed that the potential therapeutic natural compound auraptene (AUR) enhances junction assembly in cerebrovascular endothelial cells by inducing antioxidant enzymes and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). Treatment of mouse cerebrovascular endothelial cells with AUR enhanced the expression of junctional proteins, such as occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), by increasing the levels of mRNA encoding antioxidant enzymes. AUR treatment also resulted in the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of mtUPR. The ability of AUR to protect against ischemic conditions was further assessed using cells deprived of oxygen and glucose. Pretreatment of these cells with AUR protected against damage to junctional proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, accompanied by a stress resilience response regulated by levels of ATF5, LONP1 and HSP60 mRNAs. Collectively, these results indicate that AUR promotes resilience against oxidative stress and improves junction assembly, suggesting that AUR may help maintain intact barriers in cerebrovascular endothelial cells.
