Reasons why mathematics and science teachers leave the profession have been well documented and discussed. However, a critical examination of the nuances contributing to their retention warrants our attention. In this qualitative case study, I applied relational–cultural theory (Miller, 1986) to the experiences of three female mathematics and science teachers. I sought to unpack teachers’ decisions to remain in the classroom year after year and make meaning of their experiences as related to resilience in and through relationships. Based on findings from participants' experiences, recommendations for improving teacher retention along the career trajectory are offered.
