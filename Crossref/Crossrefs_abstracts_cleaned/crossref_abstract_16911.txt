Abstract
It is pointed out that the attachment styles of spouses are also very important in terms of coping with the psychological problems experienced in illness and sexual satisfaction. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of sexual attitudes and attachment styles of spouses of cancer patients on their psychological resilience. The research was carried out as a descriptive study based on the relational screening model between January and November 2021. A total of 429 spouses of cancer patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The data were collected online using the Participant Information Form, which was prepared by the researcher, Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR-S), and Hendrick Sexual Attitude Scale (BSAS). Data analyses included descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis, and linear regression using the SPSS 25.0 program. Two hundred forty-six women and 183 men were included in the study, and it has been detected that RSA scores of female participants were higher than male participants. In addition, a positive relation between RSA scores and ECR-S scores (r = 0.247) and a negative relation between RSA and BSAS (r = âˆ’0.414) were detected (p < 0.05). It was determined that the psychological resilience of spouses of cancer patients was related to sexual attitudes and attachment styles.
