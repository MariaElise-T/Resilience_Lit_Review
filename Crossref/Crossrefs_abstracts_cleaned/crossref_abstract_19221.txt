AbstractCurrent methods of crop improvement are not keeping pace with projected increases in population growth. Breeding, focused around key traits of stem height and disease resistance, delivered the step‐change yield improvements of the green revolution of the 1960s. However, subsequently, yield increases through conventional breeding have been below the projected requirement of 2.4% per year required by 2050. Genetic modification (GM) mainly for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance has been transformational, akin to a second green revolution, although GM has yet to make major inroads into intrinsic yield processes themselves. Drought imposes the major restriction on crop yields globally but, as yet, has not benefited substantially from genetic improvement and still presents a major challenge to agriculture. Much still has to be learnt about the complex process of how drought limits yield and what should be targeted. Mechanisms of drought adaptation from the natural environment cannot be taken into crops without significant modification for the agricultural environment because mechanisms of drought tolerance are often in contrast with mechanisms of high productivity required in agriculture. However, through convergence of fundamental and translational science, it would appear that a mechanism of sucrose allocation in crops can be modified for both productivity and resilience to drought and other stresses. Recent publications show how this mechanism can be targeted by GM, natural variation and a new chemical approach. Here, with an emphasis on drought, we highlight how understanding fundamental science about how crops grow, develop and what limits their growth and yield can be combined with targeted genetic selection and pioneering chemical intervention technology for transformational yield improvements. © 2017 The Authors.
