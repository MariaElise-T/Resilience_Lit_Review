UAV swarm are often subjected to random interference or malicious attacks during the execution of their tasks, resulting in UAV failure or communication interruption. When the UAV swarm is out of interference or the repair command is executed, the performance of the UAV swarm will be restored to a certain extent. However, how to measure the changes of UAV swarmâ€™s performance during this process will be very important, and it is also crucial to determine whether the UAVs can continue to perform its mission. Based on this motivation, we propose a resilience assessment framework for UAV swarm considering load balancing after UAV swarm suffer from disturbances. We analyze the effects of different topologies and different parameters on the resilience of UAV swarm. The study found that attack intensity is the most important factor affecting UAV swarm performance. As the attack intensity increases, the performance of the UAV swarm decreases rapidly. At the same time, topology also has a very important impact on UAV swarm resilience.
