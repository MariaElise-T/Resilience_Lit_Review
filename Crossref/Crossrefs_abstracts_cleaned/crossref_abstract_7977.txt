India has been facing multiple water-related challenges owing to a large population. Increase in water crisis, water resources-related pollution, mismanagement of existing resources, and an imbalance in water policies due to various gaps and lacuna at both State and Central level of governance. Water resilience is emerging as a research field that addresses multiple water management issues responding to emerging challenges, such as global climate and environmental changes. The study focuses on secondary data and literature studies from Web of Science and Scopus databases to examine the concepts of resilience as defined by literature, dimensions with planning and governance and its implications in the existing Indian water policy framework. The methodology incorporated the systematic Delphi technique in formulating the governance gaps in the research area. The highlighted gaps are further ranked using statistical methods. According to the findings, the most critical gap is the lack of integrated strategic policy planning encompassing all water-related disruptions. As its identified gaps are interconnected and aggravate each other, a comprehensive approach is required. The study suggests potential research areas that strengthen water resilience governance. There is a need to increase resilience, signifying the sheer urgency in embellishing resilience to the increasing demands and effective management of existing water resources.
