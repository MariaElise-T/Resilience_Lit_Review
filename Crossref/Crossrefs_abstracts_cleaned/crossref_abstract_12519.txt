AbstractThis research is an effort to develop a Risk Management‐based Decision Analysis (RMDA) framework based on the common fundamental elements that define the nature of resilience in Maritime Infrastructure and Transportation Systems (MITS). The framework develops a systemic approach to the decision making process in regards to investing on resilience strategies. It also enables stakeholders and decision makers of maritime systems to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks involved in MITS operations; to define ways for risk mitigation, plan for contingencies, and devise mechanisms for continuously monitoring and controlling risk factors and threats to the system; and to value the adopted resilience investment plans and strategies. Our suggested RMDA framework is developed based on the Six‐element Flexibility Framework, which is offered for assessing the value of flexibility strategies in Space Systems, and utilizes a Decision Tree Analysis (DTA) methodology for assessing the cost‐effectiveness of the devised strategies.
