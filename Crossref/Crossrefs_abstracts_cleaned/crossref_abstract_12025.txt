Purpose
The study of supply chain resilience (SCRES) continues to gain interest in the academic and practitioner communities. The purpose of this paper is to present a focused review of the SCRES literature by investigating supply chain (SC) capabilities, their relationship to SCRES outcomes and the underpinning theoretical mechanisms of this relationship.


Design/methodology/approach
The paper uses the systematic literature review approach to examine 383 articles published between 2000 and 2017, ultimately down selecting to the most relevant 228 peer-reviewed studies. Context-interventions-mechanisms-outcomes (CIMO) logic is applied to organize and synthesize these peer-reviewed studies. A typological framework is developed from the CIMO-based classification of the SCRES literature.


Findings
The findings of this study outline the gaps in the SCRES literature and present an agenda for future research.


Research limitations/implications
This paper presents an exploratory research; therefore, the typological model presented is just one of the possible perspectives.


Practical implications
The typology of SCRES literature can help practitioners to understand SCRES and to measure and assess the resilience of SCs.


Originality/value
The paper provides clear definitions of SCRES constructs, develops a typological framework to further understand SCRES and identifies SCRES measures and assessment techniques.
