AbstractBackground and ObjectivesIn addition to increased physical health risks, older adults may also experience risks to their mental health and social well-being due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, older adults may be uniquely able to cope given their life experiences and coping mechanisms. This study explores older adults’ coping experiences and strategies during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.Research Design and MethodsA Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70–97 years completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during the early weeks of regional social distancing (March 28–April 20, 2020). Participants rated their level of perceived coping and responded to open-ended questions about their daily life and coping.ResultsMean perceived coping level (on a scale from 1 to 10) was 7.9, with 87% of participants rating their coping positively. Primary themes that emerged included (a) staying busy, (b) seeking social support, and (c) having a positive mindset. These emotion-focused coping strategies appeared adaptive in the early weeks of the pandemic for most older adults.Discussion and ImplicationsContrary to predominant messaging about the vulnerability of older adults, these findings highlight the resilient nature of older adults in terms of their psychological coping and adaptability during COVID-19. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand and promote late-life coping during crises. Practitioners should seek to support older adults’ engagement in such proactive coping, and social policies should be developed to acknowledge the variable needs of older adults.
