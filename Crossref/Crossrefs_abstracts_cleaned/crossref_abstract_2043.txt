The presence of microbiota, functionally in the role of therapeutic probiotics, exerts fundamental actions upon the induction, shaping, training, and function of the host immune system, e.g. among humans. In exchange, the host immune system has largely evolved as a means to maintain and develop the symbiotic relationship of the host with these highly diverse and evolving microbes, such as yeast cells. When operating optimally, this immune system-microbiota alliance allows the induction of protective responses to inflammatory agents and pathogens and the maintenance of regulatory pathways involved in the preservation of tolerance to innocuous antigens thereby promoting both cellular and functional resilience. Resilience presents the process(s) through which individuals are enhanced in their adaptation to their resistance to adverse conditions and enabled in their capacity recover from them. Resilient individuals possess a different immunophenotype from those presenting stress susceptibility and disease-propensity.
