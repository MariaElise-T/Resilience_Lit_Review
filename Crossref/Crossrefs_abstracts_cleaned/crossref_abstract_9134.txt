PurposeThis study aims to explore the construct of teacher resilience. Researchers examined the relationship among complex risk (constraining) factors leading to burnout and attrition, as well as protective (enabling) factors that allow teachers to adapt and thrive within stressful school settings.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents results from three focus groups comprised of 33 English language arts teachers across diverse school districts. Utilizing situational analysis, developed from grounded theory, the research plan included six stages: development of initial situational map honoring theoretical sensitivity, theoretical sampling, data collection, coding, memoing, sorting, revising of the initial map based on analysis and literature review to develop the relational map.FindingsThree propositions emerged beginning to comprise a theory of teacher resilience. (1) Resilient teachers embed roots in their school communities to withstand challenges, pulling from a sense of purpose to navigate constraining factors and benefit from enabling factors. (2) Resilient teachers embrace uncertainty, reframing negative experiences into learning experiences. Reframing helps teachers retain power, not cede it to situations, which helps balance constraining and enabling factors. (3) Teachers use relationships with colleagues, students and school leaders to endure challenges. The dynamic interaction between internal and external enabling and constraining factors is depicted on the situational map illustrating how factors counterbalance to either predict positive outcomes such as resilience and agency or negative outcomes such as burnout or attrition.Originality/valueDespite a robust international evidence base, there is a dearth of US studies exploring teacher resilience. This study proposes a theory of teacher resilience relevant to US schools and recommends practical applications and future research.
