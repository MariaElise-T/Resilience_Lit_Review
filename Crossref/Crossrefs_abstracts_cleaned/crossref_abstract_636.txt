Abstract
 This research is found within the framework of the issue of University Quality. It was carried out using a sample of subjects from 6 different university schools in Argentina who extended their studies (1985-2004). The objective was to determine the factors underlying this extension. The methodology used was quantitative qualitative. The model integrates base variables, pedagogical-institutional variables, structural variables, organizational variables, and psychosocial variables. Among the latter, we focus on Cooperation - nucleus of Resilience - in relation to university success (US), taking into account that cooperation is a social/collective competence which is highly valued in the new organizational models looking toward student success (PISA, 2015; OECD 2018). The results show the impact of this factor on achievement, as well as the importance of building collective competencies.
