The ability of Novacq to improve resilience of black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, to infection and mortality induced by gill‐associated virus (GAV) was investigated. Over a 26‐d period, shrimp were fed pellets with or without 10% Novacq. Following this, four replicate tanks, each containing 10 shrimp that had been fed either diet, were maintained as‐is, injected with saline or injected with GAV inoculum (i.e., 40 shrimp for each of the six groups). For shrimp (n = 20) in two of each group of four tanks, survival was monitored daily over 14 d and a pleopod was sampled from each shrimp on Days 0 and 14. For the other two tanks, a pleopod was sampled from each shrimp on Days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 to track changes in GAV loads over time. Survival was significantly higher (P < 0.05) from Day 7 onward among the group fed Novacq. GAV infection loads appeared to vary more between individuals in the Novacq diet cohort, but overall were not reduced significantly at any time points post‐challenge compared to shrimp tested from the Control diet cohort.
