Research has provided substantial evidence on the role of parents’ well-being in the quality of parent–child relationships and children’s adjustment. Parents’ stress and parental couple conflict have been linked to children’s adverse developmental outcomes. However, little is known about the factors that affect parents’ well-being when coping with multiple stressors such as those brought by the recent COVID-19 global pandemic. Our study intended to examine the predictors of parental well-being by looking at the contextual factors of COVID-19 home confinement, i.e., the use of digital media and parents’ domestic workload, and family resilience in two countries: Ireland and Italy. Additionally, the age and number of children were controlled as potential variables impacting parents’ well-being. A three-step hierarchical regression analysis was applied. The results showed that family resilience was a very strong predictor of parents’ well-being after controlling for any other variable. Parental couples’ conflict over the use of technology predicted lower levels of parents’ well-being, while, notably, parent child-conflict and domestic workload were not associated with parents’ well-being. Additionally, the age of children did play a role: the higher the mean age of children in the family the better the parents’ well-being. The findings are discussed in the light of cross-country differences and their implications for research and practice.
