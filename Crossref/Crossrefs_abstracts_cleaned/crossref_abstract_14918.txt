AbstractUrbanization has transformed more than 50% of the land area and brought the emergence of a new humanized-based ecosystem. In answer to this, urban systems have looked for become resilient. Thus, urban landscapes must enhance their resilience capacities; robustness, adaptability, and transformability. However, there is a necessity of a well performing and easy gathering indicators. In this paper, we propose that bats are a good indicator of cityâ€™s capacity to be resilient. We used bat permanence, species diversity, and activities to analyze Mexico City resilience capacities. We used citizen science to register bat sounds around the city. From these data we identified bat species and two main activities: passes and hunting buzzes. Data showed that the east and center area of the city had the lower species richness and relative abundance, while south was the richest. This diversity patterns were in response to different habitat characteristics, mainly those related to landscape. However, activities and permanence were strongly related with human presence. The bat permanence modeled, indicated that bat community structure could be shaped under changing scenarios. Due to their differential sensitivity bats are good indicators of habitat changes in urban landscapes. Cities seeking resilience should perform planned-habitat management to achieve a bat-friendly status and promote the ecosystem services that bats can provide.
