The so-called “smart” community try to maintain a balance between supply  and demand for economic energy consumption in the future world of increased  urbanization and CO2 emissions. In recent, frequent occurrences of  disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and typhoons possibly induced by  global warming, we should build smart communities resilient against natural  and man-made risks. The resilient smart community requires two types of  solutions –soft and hard. We propose here a scheme of smart city  withstanding natural hazards taking into account disaster information  focusing on earthquake disaster information.
