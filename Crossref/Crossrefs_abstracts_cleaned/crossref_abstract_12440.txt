Abstract
Since the beginning of low impact development (LID) introduced into China, the aesthetic perspective has been a big issue in LID practices. Many landscape architects viewed LIDs as a contradiction to the traditional landscape design. Therefore, a significant challenge in Sponge City construction in China is to communicate with landscape architects understanding the importance of managing stormwater runoff and pollutant removal close to the source. In this paper, we presented a framework developed for civil engineers and landscape architects working together to guide the LID or green infrastructure design. We presented a case study in China using this guideline to build a resilient landscape with aesthetics. It illustrated that the beautiful landscape could be integrated into local LID and regional green stormwater infrastructures for flood mitigation and high pollution load removal.
