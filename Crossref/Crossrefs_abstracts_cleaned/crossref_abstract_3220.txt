Abstract
Current livestock production systems support economic growth, jobs, and nutrition but contribute to and are vulnerable to climate change. Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals will require transitioning to climate-resilient and low emissions livestock production. It is unclear, however, how the global community should invest in adapting and mitigating the impact of livestock production systems. We identified priority geographies for livestock system investments in 132 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in mid and low latitudes. Our results show that adaptation and mitigation goals are inextricably linked for the vast majority of these countries. An equal weighting of adaptation and mitigation indicators suggests that the top five investment priorities are India, Brazil, China, Pakistan, and Sudan. Across LMICs, these act as critical control points for the livestock sector's interactions with the climate system, land, and livelihoods.
