Controller failures can result in unsafe physical plant operations and deteriorated performance in industrial cyber–physical systems. In this paper, we present a controller switching mechanism over wireless sensor–actuator networks to enhance the resiliency of control systems against problems and potential physical failures. The proposed mechanism detects controller failures and quickly switches to the backup controller to ensure the stability of the control system in case the primary controller fails. To show the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct a performance evaluation using a hardware-in-the-loop testbed that considers both the actual wireless network protocol and the simulated physical system. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme recovers quickly by switching to a backup controller in the case of controller failure.
