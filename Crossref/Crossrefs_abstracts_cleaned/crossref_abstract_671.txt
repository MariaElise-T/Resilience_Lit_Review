Ensuring service continuity in safety critical applications is crucial. In some of these applications, multilevel converters play a vital role. In this regard, this research work presents a self-healing fault-tolerant control approach to ensure the resiliency of a neutral-point clamped converter when a semiconductor component encounters an open circuit fault. The defective semiconductor can be a power switch or a clamping diode. By applying the proposed real-time fault-tolerance control, the rated output voltage and output current are restored during post-fault operation. Furthermore, the total harmonic distortion value of the output voltage during application of the real time self-healing control does not increase when compared with that during healthy operation. Since the realization of the proposed control strategy does not require any bidirectional switch, a fast transition between the healthy and fault-tolerant operation is accomplished. Moreover, the proposed structure can ensure service continuity in case of a fault event in the anti-parallel diodes, something which has been overlooked in previously conducted research works.
