Over half of the world’s population depends on smallholder farms for their daily food needs. However, high levels of vulnerability and low levels of resilience to the adverse effects of climatic variations and changes constitute major threats to smallholder farms and farmers. It is within this context that this paper assessed the levels of resilience of smallholder farmers as well as the factors affecting smallholder farmers’ resilience to climate change in north western Cameroon. A mixed research approach was adopted during data collection, and data analysis was done using descriptive and inferential statistics. It was found that climate extremes were the order of the day, and farmers perceived income level, practice of agroforestry and land accessibility as the main determinants of resilience. The main resilience option practiced by most smallholder farmers was agroforestry. Chi-square and t-test statistics showed the existence of a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between smallholder farmers resilience to climate change and different environmental, institutional and socio-economic variables. Logistic regression coefficients showed the existence of a statistically significant cause-effect relationship (p<0.05) between farmers’ resilience to climate change and different environmental, institutional and socio-economic variables such as income level, land accessibility, credit accessibility, information accessibility and number of farms. From the foregoing, income level, land accessibility, credit accessibility, information accessibility and number of farms play a significant role towards enhancing smallholder farmers’ resilience to climate change. Policy makers therefore need to factor in these variables when crafting policies geared towards improving smallholder farmers’ resilience to climate change.
