 Adolescents growing up in low-income communities experience decreases in school engagement during their transition to middle school due to multiple stressors. Holding goals for their futures increases their resilience, yet research on the types of goals that are most beneficial and on parents’ influence on the formation of future goals is limited. This study investigated relations between parental academic socialization, adolescent goals, and adolescent achievement. An ethnically diverse sample of 319 students reported on their intrinsic and extrinsic future goals, current mastery goals, and parents’ academic socialization messages. Results showed that adolescents’ intrinsic future goals and current mastery goals mediated relations between parents’ messages about the importance of working hard to succeed in school and adolescents’ grades. Parents influence adolescents’ motivation and achievement by conveying messages about the value of learning, and adolescents with higher intrinsic future goals may view mastery and hard work as means of achieving those goals.
