Recently companies are complying with ESG, a social responsibility, and corporate stakeholders are using it as a standard for corporate evaluation. In a situation where unexpected social and economic uncertainty is rapidly increasing, corporate managers expect that ESG activities will increase their organizational resilience.
In this study, we test whether Korean companiesâ€™ ESG activities affect their resilience in a market with increased uncertainty by the outbreak of COVID-19.
We analyze the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate stock values and volatility for 640 companies listed in the KOSPI and KOSDAQ at a time when the financial market collapsed due to the initial spread of COVID-19. We find that the governance(G) index and the economic value of a company had a positive correlation and the social(S) index had a negative relationship. In the case of Korea, since active discussion on ESG began from 2020, the effect of ESG was not significant compared to overseas cases.
