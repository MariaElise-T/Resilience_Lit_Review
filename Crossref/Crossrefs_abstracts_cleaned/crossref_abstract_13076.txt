Anthropocene has been considered a geological period of high risk due to the indiscriminate use of natural resources and the lifestyle taken by the world population, to the detriment of ecosystem conservation. The problem requires a transdisciplinary scientific approach due to its complexity. As a contribution to studies in the anthropocene, this article aims to add resilience to the peacebuilding and show its potential in the integrated response of the different systems or levels of analysis. This approach can find a favorable echo in the study on the levels of complexity of resilience, to mobilize and succeed in situations of disasters-conflicts. At the end, we discuss some aspects for Integrative modeling, which works as lens through which the levels at which risk and vulnerability factors can be addressed. This lens supports a holistic understanding of the individual, community or nation factors that can provide a more relevant and integrative perspective on resilience for peacebuilding in a disaster context.
