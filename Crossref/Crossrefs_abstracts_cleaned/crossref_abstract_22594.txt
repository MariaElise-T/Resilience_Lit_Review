ObjectivesThe study aimed to compare the quality of life (QoL) among cancer-bereaved parents with a control group and explore how resilience and support from healthcare professionals associated with QoL of parents 2–8 years after the loss of a child to cancer.MethodsThis nationwide, cross-sectional survey was administered among parents (n=161) who lost their child to cancer between 2009 and 2014, compared with a matched control parent group (n=77). A study-specific questionnaire, Resilience Scale for Adults (six factors: ‘Perception of self’, ‘Planned future’, ‘Social competence’, ‘Structured style’, ‘Family cohesion’ and ‘Social resources’), and a single-item measure of parents’ QoL were included for the study.ResultsThere was a lower QoL in both bereaved parents (mean=5.1) compared with the control parents (mean=5.8) (p<0.001). Two resilience factors, ‘Perception of self’ (OR=1.8, p=0.004) and ‘Planned future’ (OR=2.05, p<0.001), and given sufficient information during the child’s last month (OR=2.63, p=0.003) were positively associated with long-term QoL in cancer-bereaved parents.ConclusionThe findings indicate lower QoL among both fathers and mothers 2–8 years after losing a child to cancer. The study also highlights the positive role of resilience and the importance of informational support on long-term QoL in cancer-bereaved parents. Bereavement support should be tailored for supporting individual needs.
