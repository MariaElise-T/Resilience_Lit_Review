This study aims to examine national economic resilience through the social and cultural aspects of the ""Baduy” tribe to the economy of the community in Indonesia. The “Baduy” tribe was chosen because this tribe is famous as one of the tribes that reject modernization and strongly maintain their customary heritage and ancestral land. The data collection process was carried out by conducting surveys and analyzing literature with themes that follow the broad concept of the research. The result shows that there is a significant and positive relationship between social and cultural aspects and people’s economic resilience. The social and cultural aspects of the “Baduy” tribe are in accordance with the principles of people’s economy, and this is very good to be used as an economic resilience strategy in an area facing post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions. This finding provides a view to state administrators that a development strategy that empowers people’s economy (people’s economic system) is a new rule of the game for Indonesia’s national economy because it prioritizes the prosperity of the community rather than the prosperity of individuals or certain groups."
