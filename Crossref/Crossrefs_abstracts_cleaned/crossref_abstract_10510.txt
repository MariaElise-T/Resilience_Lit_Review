AbstractWe investigate the resilience of the whole U.S. banking system (5,826 banks) over the period 2000–2018. In doing so, we employ a state‐of‐the‐art bank failure forecasting model (Gogas et al., 2018) and we uncover the evolution of the safety margin from failure for all individual U.S. banks and the banking sector as a whole every year. We provide evidence that in recent years a lower competition and new regulations widened the safety margin of the banking system, resulting in a healthier financial sector as banks become less in total number but act more prudently.
