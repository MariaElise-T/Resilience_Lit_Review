The objective is to determine if Resilience and stress coping strategies significantly influence each other in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective and cross-sectional quantitative design study, 128 students from the National Intercultural University of the Amazon, Peru were selected: 96 men (75.0%) and 32 women (25.0%), mean age 18.3 years (SD = 2.3). The Adapted Resilience Scale of Peru (ERAPE) and the Coping Mode (COPE) were used. Resilience had a significant effect at a moderate level, and coping strategies focused on problems and emotions, with planning, active coping, and lack of emotional support dominating. Effects on proportional inverse correlation can be identified through avoidance strategies: mental and behavioral withdrawal, denial, and substance use.
