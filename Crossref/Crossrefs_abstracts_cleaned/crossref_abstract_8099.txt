AbstractThe forest lands of northern New Mexico are a contested landscape fraught with conflicts over ownership, resource exploitation and land fraud. Partly in recognition of this, the US Forest Service established the Vallecitos Federal Sustained Yield in 1948 under the relatively obscure Sustained Yield Forest Management Act of 1944 to promote the “stability” of rural Hispano communities and the sustained yield of forest products. The Unit, however, has failed to live up to its promise. This paper explores the concept of resilience as a new way of looking at this ongoing conflict and examines its potential to support future policies for management of the Unit and other public lands.
