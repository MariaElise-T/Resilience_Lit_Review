This article presents a comprehensive data-driven approach on enhancing grid-connected microgrid grid resilience through advanced forecasting and optimization techniques in the context of power outages. Power outages pose significant challenges to modern societies, affecting various sectors such as industries, households, and critical infrastructures. The research combines statistical analysis, machine-learning algorithms, and optimization methods to address this issue to develop a holistic approach for predicting and mitigating power outage events. The proposed methodology involves the use of Monte Carlo simulations in MATLAB for future outage prediction, training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for forecasting solar irradiance and load profiles with a dataset spanning from 2009 to 2018, and a hybrid LSTM-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) model to improve accuracy. Furthermore, the role of battery state of charge (SoC) in enhancing system resilience is explored. The study also assesses the techno-economic advantages of a grid-tied microgrid integrated with solar panels and batteries over conventional grid systems. The proposed methodology and optimization process demonstrate their versatility and applicability to a wide range of microgrid design scenarios comprising solar PV and battery energy storage systems (BESS), making them a valuable resource for enhancing grid resilience and economic efficiency across diverse settings. The results highlight the potential of the proposed approach in strengthening grid resilience by improving autonomy, reducing downtime by 25%, and fostering sustainable energy utilization by 82%.
