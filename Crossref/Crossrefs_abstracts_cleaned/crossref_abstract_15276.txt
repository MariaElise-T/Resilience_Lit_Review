The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on individualsâ€™ mental health. Individuals have tended to obtain information about the pandemic from social media. With the aim of exploring the relationship between subjective happiness and social media usage during the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible moderating role of resilience in this relationship, we asked 277 young adults in Iran to complete a number of online questionnaires, including a demographic questionnaire, a survey on social media usage, a subjective happiness scale and a brief resilience scale. The results showed that there is a significant negative correlation between social media usage and subjective happiness. In terms of the different degrees to which resilience can act as a moderator, our findings showed that when resilience is average or high, the relationship between social media usage and subjective happiness is significant. This study has implications for mental health professionals seeking knowledge about happiness during periods of adversity.
