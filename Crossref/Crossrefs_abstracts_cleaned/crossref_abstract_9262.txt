Project management teams have to deal with risks and uncertainties from the project portfolio level to the individual level. Furthermore, project complexity adds to the challenges faced by the project management team. Moreover, projects are performed by project management teams comprising various individuals from different backgrounds. While they perform their project tasks, they have to face dynamics in the projects that lead to major challenges or stress and bounce back from negative experiences to be less likely to experience the detrimental effects of intimidating, uncertain situations. This study aims to show the influence of multi-perspective factors on team resilience and to confirm how team resilience influences team performance. A descriptive, quantitative study was conducted to test the six hypotheses of the study. Data collected through purposive sampling and snowball techniques were analyzed using a structural equation model with SmartPLS software version 3.2.9. The finding shows that individual resilience from the individual perspective, team resources, team interactions from the team perspective and organizational practice all have a positive and significant influence on team resilience, but transformational leadership does not. Team resilience has a positive, significant relationship with team performance. Team resilience appears to have had a strong and significant effect on team performance in multiple industries in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research implications and suggestions for future research are also given.
