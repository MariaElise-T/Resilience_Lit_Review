            This study aimed to determine the effect of psychological resilience on hope in individuals with schizophrenia. This was a cross-sectional study. One hundred and one (101) individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia were included in the study. The Descriptive Characteristics Form, Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and Herth Hope Scale (HHS) were used to collect data. A positive and moderate correlation was observed between the individuals' mean total HHS scores and mean total BRS scores (
            P
            < .05,
            r
            = 0.508). Additionally, as a result of regression analysis, hope was found to be associated with 25% of the total variance in psychological resilience. The results of this study indicate that as the psychological resilience of the individuals increased, their hope levels increased, or as the hope levels of the individuals increased, their psychological resilience increased.
