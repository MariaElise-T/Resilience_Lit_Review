A digital substation is an example of a cyber-physical system that is a sophisticated system consisting of two closely interrelated subsystems: physical (technological) and information-communication ones. Sophistication and vulnerability of an information-communication subsystem that performs functions of management becomes comparable to those of a physical subsystem. In the latest years the studies have been focused on the problems of cyber attacks against information-communication subsystems as potential external disturbances of present-day cyber-physical systems. Resilience is ability of an informational system to survive in the conditions of continuous cyber attacks. The proposed here approach to assessment of digital substation resilience using an event tree can serve as expertâ€™s assistance in ensuring the digital substation resilience.
