Abstract
As Indonesia officially acknowledged as one of the countries infected by Covid-19, a solution model is needed during a pandemic, not only because of Covid-19, but also to anticipate a pandemic in the years to come. The theories used were the theory of the information society, the theory of covid-19, and the theory of the public private partnership. While the methodology used was qualitative. The results of the research described how to find solutions and also in the form of a solution model with mutual synergy. Given that this pandemic will end, we need a multidisciplinary approach, one of which is from the perspective of national resilience.
