AbstractWith an increasing frequency of natural disasters and security attacks, the safe and stable operation of smart grid has been challenged unprecedently. To reduce the economic loss and social impact caused by power outage accidents, it is urgent to develop and improve the smart grid technology, and strengthen the disaster resistance and recovery capability of smart grids when faced with extreme events. As an efficient and flexible secondary energy source, hydrogen is crucial in improving the resilience of smart grid and supporting energy security. To further promote the deep integration of hydrogen systems and smart grid and improve the energy system resilience, the resilience of smart grids supported by hydrogen is assessed in this study. First, a technical framework of hydrogen‐powered smart grid resilience is established, and the value of hydrogen‐powered smart grid resilience is analysed considering different time frames (before, during and after an extreme event) of smart grids facing extreme events. Then, hydrogen‐powered smart grid resilience is investigated from perspectives of pre‐prevention regulation, in‐process correction regulation, and post‐recovery regulation. Finally, future direction for hydrogen‐powered smart grid resilience is investigated and related policy suggestions are provided.
