Using survey data of middle school students from Ye county in Henan province and Chenggu and Ningqiang county in Shaanxi province, China, adopting latent class analysis and hierarchical linear regression, this study analyzes the impact of parental remote migration and parent-child relation types on the psychological resilience of rural left-behind children. The results show that: Only mother’s remote migration has a significantly negative impact on the psychological resilience of rural left-behind children, the time of parental first migration, the distance of father’s migration, and children’s migration have no significant impacts; parent-child relation of “alienation connection and weak function” or parent-child relation combination of “parental alienation connection and weak function” is the most unfavorable factor for the psychological resilience of rural left-behind children, while father-child relation of “close connection but lacking function”, mother-child relation of “intimate connection and strong function”, and combination of “paternal close connection but lacking function - maternal intimate connection and strong function” are the most favorable factors. There is gender difference in the impact of father-child relation types and mother-child relation types, the impact of father-child relation types is stronger than that of mother-child relation types; harmonious parental relation, supportive friends, caring teachers, and moderate home-school interaction are favorable for the psychological resilience of rural left-behind children.
