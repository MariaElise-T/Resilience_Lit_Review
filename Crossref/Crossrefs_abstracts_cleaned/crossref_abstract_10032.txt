The flaxseed oil (FSO)  rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were supplemented orally to ten male and female neonatal calves from day 6 of birth to day 28 to improve resilience to disease incidences (TG) and compared to calves reared without PUFA supplement (CG). The PUFA supplementation in liquid form was discontinued on day 29 and fed as bolus consisting of 25 g of ground flaxseed and 25 g of jaggery until day 90. The total dry matter intake in cluding milk solids in neonata calves was 400 g in CG and 428 g in TG (P=0.38).  Digestible DMI, CP and energy intake in male and female calves of TGs was significantly (P< 0.05) higher the CG. However, the body weight gain in calves during neonatal (P=0.08) and preweaning (P=0.14) age was comparable between groups. The serum IgG were 30 mg/mL on day 2 but higher in calves in TGs on day 7 (P=0.08) and day 14 (P=0.07)after birth but comparable in subsequent period until day 30 after birth. Calves resilience to diarrhea, pyrexia, anorexia, skin infection, profused lacrimation, navel ill, muzzle keratinization, umbilical hernia, fecal consistency (FC), and egg count (FEC) were examined. PUFA supplementation reduced the disease risk rate in TG by 42% (P< 0.001) and diarrhea by three folds compared to CG. Haemoglobin, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes improved significantly from day 30 after birth. The intervention was recommended to reduce calf mortality and imrpoved health and body weight gain during neonatal and preweaning age.
