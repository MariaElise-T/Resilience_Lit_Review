The purpose of the present research was to examine the possibility that trait resilience can serve adaptive functions in regulating the effects of relationship damaging effects of relationship conflict stress. Specifically, the present research suggested that trait resilience facilitates the experience of positive emotion, which weakens the relationship between conflict stress and residual emotions for the other party in conflict situations. A 14-day diary study was conducted to collect relationship conflict in daily life. The results of analysis of 297 conflict events showed that trait resilience affected the level of positive emotion experienced after conflict occurrence, which significantly moderated the strength of indirect effects of conflict stress on residual emotions. These findings indicate that trait resilience can serve as a protective factor against the relationship damaging effects of relationship conflicts. The discussion focuses on implications of the findings in terms of organizational adjustment and organizational effectiveness, limitations and suggestions for future research.
