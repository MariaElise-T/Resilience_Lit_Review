Free space optical (FSO) communication has gained widespread attention due to its advantages, including high confidentiality, high communication capacity, and no limitation of spectrum. One of the great challenges in FSO communication is the transmission performance degradation in atmospheric turbulence channel due to wavefront distortion and scintillation. Here, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a 120 Gbit/s vector beam multiplexed coherent optical communication system with turbulence-resilient capacity. Four multiplexed vector beams, each carrying a 30 Gbit/s quadrature phase-shift keying signal, propagate through different turbulence conditions. The influence of turbulence channel on the vector beam impairments is experimentally investigated. Under the weaker turbulence conditions, the system bit error rates are below the forward error correction threshold of 3.8 × 10−3. In comparison with the Gaussian mode, the communication interruption probability of the vector beams system decreases from 36% to 12%-18% under stronger turbulence conditions.
