 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic and social impacts worldwide and revealed the importance and urgency of urban resilience enhancement. To learn the lessons from this pandemic, this study undertook a case study in Wuhan City, which was the first city in China where the outbreak was declared, and analyzed the process of its response to the pandemic. Based on the theory of emergency management, this study identified four stages of the emergency management process and conducted an in-depth analysis of the experience gained at each stage from the perspective of urban resilience. Then, this study evaluated the level of urban resilience of Wuhan City, and put forward suggestions for enhancement of the emergency system of China. The findings provided important revelation for other cities to cope with major disasters in the future.
