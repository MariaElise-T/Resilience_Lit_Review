Resilience is an important attribute for mental health. Positive benefits felt by resilient individualsinclude fewer depressive episodes, and better coping strategies. Due to the positive outcomesexperienced by resilient people, it may be clinically useful to examine this construct within apsychotherapeutic context. Accordingly, we created the Brunner-Lei-Peters Resilience Scale, whichincluded a preliminary test of 70 items and 10 validity items; we tested the scale on a sample of 150people. Participants were representative of the general population with about an equal representationof gender and a wide age range from 18 to 66 years of age. Although the scale initially included 70items, through psychometric analysis, we reduced the scale to 15 items, while maintaining soundpsychometric validity and reliability. Clinical implications and limitations of the scale are discussed.Â
