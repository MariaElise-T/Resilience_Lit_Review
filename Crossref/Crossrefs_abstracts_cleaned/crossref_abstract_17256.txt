AbstractThe paper explores the role of tourism demand and cultural World Heritage Sites on the regional economic resilience among European Union countries. The results pinpoint to the importance of cultural World Heritage Sites in keeping the regional economic resilience. The results on tourism demand are not unambiguousâ€”domestic tourist arrivals play a significantly positive role while inbound tourist arrivals negatively affect regional economic resilience. Cultural tourism, defined as the joint effect of tourism and cultural sites, decreases the negative effect of inbound tourism, pinpointing that the cultural sites play an essential role in attracting inbound tourists in the less prosperous periods.
