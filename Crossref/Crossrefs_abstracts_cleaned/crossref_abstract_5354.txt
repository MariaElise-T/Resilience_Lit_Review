Introduction: Adolescence is a vulnerable phase full of changes and challenges. The changes include biological, cognitive, and social aspects. The stages of adolescents’ developmental tasks are based on ego and integrity to establish a stable self-identity and determine roles. However, identity lapses frequently occur in adolescence, such as bullying behavior that can cause psychological and physical problems in victims and perpetrators. Adolescents experiencing bullying behavior require resilience as an adaptive coping mechanism for managing external and internal pressures within the individual. This study aims to identify the relationship between bullying behavior and adolescent resilience.Methods: This study used a quantitative correlational method with a cross-sectional approach. The variables studied were bullying behavior and resilience.Results: Demographic characteristics in this study included age, gender, and living partner. The sample of this study was 163 respondents selected with the Accidental Sampling technique. This study showed that respondents who committed bullying were 99 respondents (60.7%), and those who did not were 64 respondents (39.3%). Overall, 61 respondents had a high resilience rate (37.4%).  The results showed a relationship (p-value = 0.000 and r of -0.684) with a strong interpretation.Conclusion: It can be concluded that the higher the bullying behavior is, the lower the level of resilience of adolescents will be. It is expected that adolescents can use resilience as adaptive coping to prevent bullying behavior.
