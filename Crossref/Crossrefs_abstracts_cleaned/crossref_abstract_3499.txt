Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, common, and progressive disease of the nervous system, and the affected individuals suffer from its complications throughout their lives and experience different physical and emotional disorders. Objectives: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive-behavioral ‎therapy (CBT) in enhancing resiliency and quality of life among MS patients. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was carried out on 30 MS patients referred to the Department of Neurology in Baqiyatallah Hospital (Tehran, Iran) during February 19 to September 1, 2017. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) ACT (n = 10, 8 sessions, 90-minute weekly‎ sessions), (2) CBT (n = 10, 10 sessions, 90-minute weekly‎ sessions), and (3) control group (n = 10, no sessions). The resilience and quality of life were measured in pre-test and post-test phases and 1.5 months after treatment using the Connor-Davidson Resilience and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scales, respectively. Repeated measurement ANOVA and SPSS Software (version 24) were used in this study to analyze the collected data. Results: The study sample consisted of 30 MS patients (mean age = 31.7 ± 5.7, 60% female and 57% married). The three groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic and baseline variables. The results demonstrated that both ACT and CBT had the same effectiveness in increasing resiliency (mean difference in CBT = 0.9 vs ACT = 0.8 (P = 0.882); CBT = 0.9 vs. Control = -1.4 (P = 0.004); ACT = 0.8 vs. Control = -1.4 (P = 0.0041)) and quality of life (mean difference in CBT = 2.9 vs ACT = 3.1 (P = 0.051); CBT = 2.9 vs. Control = 0.6 (P = 0.002); ACT = 3.1 vs. Control = 0.6 (P = 0.014)) among the MS patients so that the participants’ post-test and follow-up scores increased significantly compared to the pretest scores. Conclusions: The present study results indicate that ACT and CBT can equally enhance resiliency and quality of life among MS patients.
