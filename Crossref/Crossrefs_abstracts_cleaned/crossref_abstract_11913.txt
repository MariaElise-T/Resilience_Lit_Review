 Abstract: Objectives: This study aimed to analyze Japanese youth athletes’ mental health and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the potential correlations between their demographic factors and mental health outcomes. Methods: Participants were recruited from a single high school with a student population encompassing national-level competitors (NCs), local-level competitors (LCs), and general students (i.e., others; OTs), aiming to reduce the impact of differences in environmental conditions affecting pandemic-related stress. In March 2021, the students completed an anonymous online survey comprising questions on demographics and COVID-19, as well as the following scales: Kessler 6 (K6), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the Resilience Scale. Differences and correlations among these groups’ scores were analyzed while controlling for covariates. Results: Of 1,022 students (51.3% girls), 22.3% were NCs, 38.6% were LCs, and 39.0% were OTs. NCs reported significantly lower scores on the K6, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, as well as significantly higher resilience scores, compared with LCs and OTs. Resilience scores had a significantly negative correlation with the K6, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 scores. Female gender, participation in cultural clubs, and indoor sports were factors associated with scores above the cut-off on each scale. COVID-19 testing, history of illness, and family history were not associated with any of the psychological evaluation measures. Conclusion: Based on responses to the self-reported questionnaires, NCs appear to have better mental health than their peers, while resilience has a potential association with improved mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
