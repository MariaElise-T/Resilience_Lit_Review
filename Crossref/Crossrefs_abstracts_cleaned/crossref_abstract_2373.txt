AbstractResilient regions seem to be able to retain a higher level of entrepreneurial activity in times of crisis, when the capacity of new firms to survive and thrive is severely put to test. Aiming to find which regional characteristics sustain entrepreneurship resilience, this paper explores the impact of the recent economic and financial crisis on the survival of new firms, using Romania as an exponent of post‐communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. After testing a wide range of potential explicative factors, we found that the most consequential ones are the foreign direct investments, population growth and the agglomeration of active firms. A custom‐made economic crisis variable differentiated the recession time span for each county, according to its individual response to crisis, and allowed us to find how the economic crisis changes the spatial influence of the variables. The spatial panel framework used for this analysis showed that location matters for the survival of newly born firms.
