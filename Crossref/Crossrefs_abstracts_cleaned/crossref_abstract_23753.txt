This study aims to validate the Malay version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS-M) in order for the scale to be available among the Malay-speaking population. Two hundred and ninety-eight non-academic staff completed the Malay version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS-M), Malay Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI-M), and Malay Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (M-DASS-21). To explore the factor structure of BRS-M, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with the first group of 149 participants was conducted using FACTOR (v.11) software. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted from the data of the second group of 149 participants using SEM_PLS software. The EFA revealed a two-factor model; Factor 1 =”Resilience” and Factor 2 = ”Succumbing”. The CFA indicated a sufficient internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.806 and McDonald’s omega, ω = 0.812) and a good fit with SRMR = 0.031. BRS-M, CBI-M, and M-DASS-21 displayed a satisfactory concurrent validity result. Household income and marital status had significant association with resilience level, with low household income (B40 group) being a predictor of lower resilience. The BRS-M demonstrated favourable psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity to assess the level of resilience among non-academic staff in Malaysia.
