Edge applicationâ€™s distributed nature presents significant challenges for developers in orchestrating and managing the multitenant applications. In this paper, we propose a practical edge cloud software framework for deploying multitenant distributed smart applications. Here we exploit commodity, a low cost embedded board to form distributed edge clusters. The cluster of geo-distributed and wireless edge nodes not only power multitenant IoT applications that are closer to the data source and the user, but also enable developers to remotely deploy and orchestrate application containers over the cloud. Specifically, we propose building a software platform to manage the distributed edge nodes along with support services to deploy and launch isolated and multitenant user applications through a lightweight container. In particular, we propose an architectural solution to improve the resilience of edge cloud services through peer collaborated service migration when the failures happen or when resources are overburdened. We focus on giving the developers a single point control of the infrastructure over the intermittent and lossy wide area networks (WANs) and enabling the remote deployment of multitenant applications.
