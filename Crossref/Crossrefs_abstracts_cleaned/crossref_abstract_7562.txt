Introduction: This short report describes the piloting of a resilience building workshop for pharmacy interns to aid with the transition from university to the workforce.   
Methods: A 2-hour workshop was designed focussing on responding to change and exploration of real-life examples that interns had encountered in the workplace. The workshop involved a combination of whole and small group discussions, problem-solving and self-reflection. A total of 108 interns participated in the workshop as part of The University of Sydney Pharmacy Intern Training Program.   
Conclusion: Pharmacy educators must continue to embed resilience training in curricula to promote graduates’ readiness to transition and deal with adversity in the contemporary workforce.
