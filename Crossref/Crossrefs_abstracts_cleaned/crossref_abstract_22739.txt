 Dementia and its progressive nature necessitate care and impose dependency on family caregivers, exposing them to psychological distress and even abuse of people with dementia. The effects of psychological distress and subsequent abuse can be lessened with increased resilience. This study investigates the effect of a supportive online education program on family caregivers’ resilience and abuse of people with dementia. In total, 74 family caregivers of dementia patients participated in this controlled randomized trial, which was conducted from February 2022 to July 2022. Data were gathered using the Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire, and the Caregiver Abuse Screen. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS software using descriptive and inferential statistics. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of baseline variables, resilience, and abuse. The intervention resulted in no significant difference in the scores of resilience ( p = .08) and abuse ( p = .447). Both the intervention ( p = .430) and control ( p = .082) groups showed no evidence of a significant change in resilience between before and after the intervention. However, a significant difference was found in the abuse scores before and after the study in the intervention group ( p = .022). The intervention did not significantly affect family caregivers’ resilience and abuse of people with dementia, but it reduced abuse in the intervention group. Taking note of these results, this study proposes other solutions to improve outcomes, and also education and support of family caregivers to diminish their abuse of people with dementia.
