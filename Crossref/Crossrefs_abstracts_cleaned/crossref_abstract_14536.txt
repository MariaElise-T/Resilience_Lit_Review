Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) present significant potential for improving road safety and mitigating traffic congestion for the future mobility system. However, cooperative driving vehicles are more vulnerable to cyberattacks when communicating with each other, which will introduce a new threat to the transportation system. In order to guarantee safety aspects, it is also necessary to ensure a high level of information quality for CAV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation on the impacts of cyberattacks on CAV in mixed traffic (large vehicles, medium vehicles, and small vehicles) from the perspective of vehicle dynamics. The paper aims to explore the influence of cyberattacks on the evolution of CAV mixed traffic flow and propose a resilient and robust control strategy (RRCS) to alleviate the threat of cyberattacks. First, we propose a CAV mixed traffic car-following model considering cyberattacks based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Furthermore, a RRCS for cyberattacks is developed by setting the acceleration control switch and its impacts on the mixed traffic flow are explored in different cyberattack types. Finally, sensitivity analyses are conducted in different platoon compositions, vehicle distributions, and cyberattack intensities. The results show that the proposed RRCS of cyberattacks is robust and can resist the negative threats of cyberattacks on the CAV platoon, thereby providing a theoretical basis for restoring the stability and improving the safety of the CAV.
