AbstractStreet connected young people (SCYP) are at risk of encountering negative life experiences, such as abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation. Nonetheless, some demonstrate remarkable resilience. This study therefore aimed to explore protective factors that promote resilience in SCYP in Guatemala City. Using ethnographic interviews and image elicitation eight young people and four adult educational outreach project coordinators participated within this study. Three key protective factors emerged that help develop resilience; Empowerment, as educational projects support SCYP and provide opportunities; Belongingness, encapsulated creating positive relationships, a sense of affinity and positive family environments; and Motivation which highlighted the importance of the young peoples’ willpower, engagement with learning and help‐seeking behaviour. Educational projects working with SCYP can help to develop resilience by empowering them for change, providing a sense of belonging, while also acknowledging their individual motivation for change.
