The purpose of this study is to identify the degree of depression and resilience in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with ostomy and describe the correlation between depression and resilience in UC and CD patients with ostomy. 24 UC patients and 66 CD patients with ostomy were recruited from Metropolitan Hospital in Seoul, Korea. The total mean scores of depression and resilience in UC patients were 13.42 and 123.75, respectively, and in CD patients with ostomy they were 14.24 and 119.18, respectively. Depression and resilience in UC patients with ostomy were not correlated with general characteristics. Depression in CD patients with ostomy correlated with marital status (t = 2.27, P = 0.027), economic status (F = 3.98, P = 0.012), sleep disorder (t = 4.73, P < 0.001), and sleep time (t = 2.11, P = 0.039). Resilience in UC patients with ostomy correlated with religion (t = 2.47, P = 0.016), marital status (t = −3.61, P = 0.001), economic status (F = 4.06, P = 0.011), and sleep disorder (t = −3.11, P = 0.003). Significant negative correlation was found between depression and resilience in UC (r = −0.668, P < 0.001) and CD patients with ostomy (r = −0.604, P < 0.001). We recommend counselling to wound ostomy continence nurses (WOCNs) about their goal setting, facilitating adaptation of disease and ostomy in clinical setting. And we expect that WOCNs adopt a formalised and tailored long‐term approach or program to follow up for UC and CD patients with ostomy.
