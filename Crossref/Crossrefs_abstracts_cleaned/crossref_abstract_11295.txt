The paper presents the results of a study testing the moderating role of the motivation for mathematics learning between mental health problem and resilience in children. The sample consisted in 707 Romanian children, (average age 13 years old). The students filled in the questionaries for strengths and difficulties (SDQ), the CYRM for Resilience (Ungar& Theron, 2019) and a questionnaire for mathematics attitudes. The results indicate a significant moderating effect of the mathematic motivation for the relationship between mental health problems (difficulties such as emotional problem, behavioral problems, hyperactivity and peer relations problem) and resilience. So, the mathematic motivation learning reduces the negative effect of mental health problems on resilience, contributing as a protective factor in front of difficulties. There are implications for learning design in educational settings, so the teachers could pay more attention to enhance the student’s motivation for learning mathematics as a possible intervention to enhance resilience.
