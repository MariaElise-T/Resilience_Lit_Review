Flooding and drought are two of the most common environmental problems in Andir Urban Village due to its location near a tributary of the Citarum River, its concave geographic structure, and excessive groundwater usage. Traditional approaches that focus on constructing water management structures cannot provide a sustainable solution to these persistent problems in Andir. Thus, increasing resilience in dealing with flooding and drought effectively from different aspects is important. This study uses the Flood Resilience Index (FRI) via several indicators divided into five aspects, i.e., natural, physical, economic, social, and institutional. The Drought Resilience Index (DRI) measures the reliability and vulnerability of clean water supply and demand for local residents. The flood resilience level of Andir Urban Village is low with an FRI of 2.69/5, while the drought resilience level of Andir Urban Village is very low with a DRI of only 2.565/10. The measurements of FRI and DRI in a developing country needs to be done carefully by developing local indicators that are unique and relevant to the countryâ€™s setting.
