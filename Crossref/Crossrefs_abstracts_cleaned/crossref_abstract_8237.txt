 The aim of this study is to examine the predictive relationships between marital adjustment, psychological birth order, and psychological resilience of married individuals. The study was on the relational survey model; 461 married individuals from Ankara, Istanbul, and Konya/Turkey participated in the research. The sample was randomly selected. In the study, “Marital Adjustment Scale,” “White-Campbell Psychological Birth Order Inventory,” and “Brief Resilience Scale” were used. In the analysis data, Pearson Correlation test and Amos software were used for structural equation modeling analysis. As a result of the analysis, we found that psychological resilience predicted marital adjustment and psychological birth order, and psychological birth order predicted marital adjustment. Psychological resilience negatively affected the subdimensions of oldest, middle, and only child, while it positively affected the subdimension of youngest child. The subdimension of only child negatively affected the marital adjustment and partially mediates the effect of psychological resilience on marital adjustment.
