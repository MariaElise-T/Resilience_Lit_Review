This article proposes a multidimensional method for measuring and evaluating museum resilience holistically. The research highlights the lack of a framework for understanding the level of resilience in museums and the contribution of museums to resilience. To this end, a model is presented based on three enabling dimensions, namely, structure, people, and relationships. The model is applied to the museums of the Marche region’s “seismic crater” (Italy). Qualitative information and data drawn from the regional authority’s Museum Information System were evaluated using exploratory analysis techniques. On the basis of a cluster analysis, four categories of museums are identified according to their degree of resilience. The results suggest that human resources is an area that is commonly in need of upgrading. Nevertheless, the evidence on the heterogeneity of the clusters in terms of structure and relationships calls for a diversified approach to identifying priorities, investments, and public policies.
