Sindh province, Pakistan is home to the seventh largest delta, at the mouth of the River Indus and holder RAMSAR designation. A large arid mangrove forest system once occupied the coastal belt. Systematic removal over the past 50 years has exposed the delta to energy higher during cyclones and climate related threats, most notably rising water levels and combined flood risk from extreme events. The loss of mangrove has resulted in agricultural land loss, saline intrusion, and population migration. The Sindh Coastal Resilience Project introduces a National Adaptation Plan alongside investment in key flood risk management interventions; enhancing the mangrove buffer to provide stability, improving water and sediment connectivity, and introducing embankments and flood schemes at key nodal points through the Indus Delta.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/MzBJzHOw4yw
