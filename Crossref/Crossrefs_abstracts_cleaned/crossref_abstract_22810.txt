Objectives  This study investigated university students’ self-leadership, resilience, critical thinking disposition, adjustment to college, correlations among them, and the effects of their self-leadership, resilience, and critical thinking disposition on adjustment to college.
Methods  The research was conducted with 221 undergraduate students attending a 4-year university in Korea. The participating students’ levels of self-leadership, resilience, critical thinking disposition, and adjustment to college were assessed. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 to conduct descriptive statistics for all variables, correlation analysis among them and among their sub-components, and step-wise multiple regression analysis to examine the influence on the dependent variable.
Results  First, the results of the descriptive statistical analysis revealed that among self-leadership, resilience, critical thinking disposition, and adjustment to college, the students’ resilience level was the highest. Second, the highest significant positive correlations were found between the students' resilience and critical thinking dis-position, as well as between self-leadership and resilience. Third, resilience emerged as the most influential vari-able on the students’ adjustment to college, and among the sub-components, a sense of control and positivity were found to have significant impacts.
Conclusions  Based on the research findings, it is suggested that to enhance university students' adjustment to college, universities should implement measures at the institutional level to increase students' resilience with par-ticular attention to enhance the ability to control their actions and think positively.
