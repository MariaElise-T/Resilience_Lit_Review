Abstract
With the deepening of energy transformation, multi-energy coupling has become an effective method to alleviate the energy gap and improve the energy utilization rate. As a bridge connecting users and the power system, the distribution network is becoming multi-energy coupling as well. Therefore, to ensure a stable supply of power, heat, and other energy sources, it is of great significance to study the resilience improvement of multi-energy coupling distribution networks. This paper proposes a strategy for improving the resilience of multi-energy coupling distribution networks considering movable energy storage equipment (MESS) configuration. Firstly, the multi-energy coupling distribution network model is established, and the mathematical model of each piece of equipment is established considering the coupling of the power grid and heat grid. Secondly, based on the loss of load probability (LOLP), considering the importance of the load, it is expanded to the loss of important load probability as an index to evaluate the resilience of distribution networks. Thirdly, a distribution network resilience improvement model based on the configuration and operation of the MESS is established, and the optimal configuration capacity and operation strategy of the MESS is solved by taking the minimum operation cost as the objective function, i.e., the configuration cost of the MESS, the load shedding cost and the cost of wind and PV abandonment. Finally, based on the IEEE-33 node distribution network, a multi-energy coupling distribution network model is built, which verifies that the method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the total cost and improve the resilience of the multi-energy coupling distribution network.
