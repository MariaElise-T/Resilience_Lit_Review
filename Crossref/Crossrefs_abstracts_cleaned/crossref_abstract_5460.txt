Psychological resilience has been, to a certain extent, explained by Western   individualistic,   and   static   factors.   However,   dynamic factors  that  affect  the  resilience  through  the  process  are proofed to be more important, i.e. culture. In some collectivist nations, like Afghanistan,  the  meaning  of  work  embedded  in  what  their  own culture  taught  them.  Afghan  cultural  context  may  provide  the foundation  for  different  ways  of  knowing,  including  resilience,  by people  in  that  nation.  So,  the  main  aim  of  this  research  is  to  find out  the  impact  of  psychological  resilience  on  work  engagement from  the  Afghan  national  cultural  perspective.  In  a  study  of  713 staffs   from   27   universities   in   Afghanistan   show   that   work engagement  dimensions  are  more  related  to  the  social  and  family factor  of  resilience  than  individual  ones,  supporting  the  cultural cohesion  theory  of  individuals  of  Afghan  people.  Resiliency  and energy    are    also    one    of    the    critical    components    of    work engagement,  vitality  as  a  more  individualistic  work  engagement factor lost its importance.
