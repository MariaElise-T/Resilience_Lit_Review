The need to reduce CO2 emissions makes companies find new sustainable solutions for energy production. Diverse multiple sourcing energy production value chains became an important strategical development used at a regional level in Finland. This article presents a social sustainability state data visualization framework that allows us to communicate key social aspects to stakeholders and local communities. Core social aspects are defined through the assessment of multiple sourced electricity supply chains available within one region. This framework was tested on a case study covering regional electricity production supply chains in the Oulu sub-region, Finland. The evaluation of social indicators and their impacts presented along regional electricity production supply chains was performed via the conversion of collected data into visual objects. A cumulative social impact assessment of a local energy supply chain revealed that social sustainability impacts have the tendency to accumulate within the region. The results indicate that multiple sourced electricity supply chains are a socially sustainable solution that improve energy security and provide affordable electricity to local communities. The results indicate how by using multiple-sourcing value chains, companies can improve regional social resilience and balance socio-efficiency through building an effective relation between a companyâ€™s value added and its social impact on local communities.
