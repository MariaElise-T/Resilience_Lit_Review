PurposeA globalized world demands proactive tactics from organizational supply chains. Companies should be capable of mitigating the impacts of natural and manmade disasters, which requires that they understand their stages of maturity and resilience. This study develops a theoretical model of the relationship between maturity and resilience, seeking to guide decision-making about aligning these two concepts.Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review was conducted to identify the constructs that form the basis for our proposed maturity and resilience model.FindingsThe authors identified the key constructs related to maturity and resilience by analyzing the existing literature and selected 13 constructs and 3 maturity stages to construct our maturity and resilience model.Research limitations/implicationsThis research contributes to the supply chain management literature, especially that involving the themes of maturity and resilience. It can encourage research to develop future empirical research in the field to validate and overcome the limitations of the initial model the authors propose.Practical implicationsThe authorsâ€™ proposed model supports supply chain managers in establishing strategies to increase resilience based on the maturity of the chains they manage, enabling them to face crises such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Originality/valueThe model presents a holistic view of maturity and resilience in supply chains contributing to supply chain theory by examining the alignment between the two themes.
