The article is devoted to the study of the features of defensive coping behavior in hearing impaired adolescents with different levels of resilience. The relationship between defensive-coping behavior and the level of resilience is analyzed. It was revealed that hearing impaired adolescents with a low level of resilience are dominated by such forms of protective-coping behavior as: seeking social support, escape-avoidance, denial, regression, suppression, distancing; and for hard of hearing adolescents with a high level of resilience - planning for problem solving, intellectualization, projection, acceptance of responsibility and positive reappraisal.
