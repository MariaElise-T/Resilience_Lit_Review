Acapulco, a global tourist destination, faces challenges from frequent hydrometeorological events. This article examines its vulnerability and governmental responses to hurricanes. The study focuses on analyzing resilience in adversity through the case of Acapulco after Hurricane Otis category 5 from October 25, 2023. The objectives were to synthesize vulnerability and governmental responses to natural events in Acapulco, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and resilience. The methodology involved collection official data on climatic events, economic losses, and governmental responses. The evolution of the population and affected infrastructure was analyzed, focusing on specific cases such as Hurricane Otis. The results reveal an increase in vulnerability due to population growth and urban development without considering climatic risks. Despite governmental efforts in hurricane response, a lack of preparedness and risk communication impacted the city’s resilience. Therefore, the study will aim to extract lessons learned from the experience of Acapulco to provide practical recommendations for enhancing resilience in other communities facing similar disasters. Conclusions are as follows: 1) Acapulco’s vulnerability is heightened by growth without considering climatic risks; 2) governmental responses, though coordinated, need improvement in preparedness and risk communication; and 3) the key to sustainability lies in joining efforts, reducing vulnerability, and promoting resilience to extreme climatic events and 4) informing about the future strategy for disaster management and reconstruction in affected communities.
