PurposeDue to increasing uncertainty in the global business scenario, research on supply chain resilience is gaining significance. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and magnified the issues already pertaining in the supply chain thereby increasing the vulnerabilities in the network. This study attempts to build the concept of pseudo-resilience in supplier selection and evaluation for supply chain sustainability.Design/methodology/approachA combination of multi-criteria decision-making methods AHP and R is adopted, and an integrated method called Combined AHP–R method is used to identify and include the property of pseudo-resilience into supplier selection processes.FindingsThe authors identified various factors contributing to pseudo-resilience considering supplier selection process and found the most important attribute. Using the combined AHP–R method, the suppliers were evaluated, considering the attributes contributing to the pseudo-resilience of supply chains and best supplier was selected.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing a supplier selection problem for sustainable supply chains, considering pseudo-resilience. Also, this is the first study to apply the AHP–R method for supplier selection in the resilience or sustainability context.
