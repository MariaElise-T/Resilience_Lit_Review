 The UKâ€™s national railway network has evaluated climate change impacts, risks and adaptation solutions. This review establishes the case for greater attention to be given to the vulnerability of rail transport beyond the mainline network. By considering the resilience of high-speed rail, mass rapid transit systems and light rail transit systems, the overall resilience of journeys can be improved. To this end, this review establishes current knowledge, practice and policy relating to rail beyond the mainline and outlines the next steps to achieve resilience. By providing this overview of advances, challenges and opportunities, practitioners and academics alike will be stimulated to pursue further resilience.
