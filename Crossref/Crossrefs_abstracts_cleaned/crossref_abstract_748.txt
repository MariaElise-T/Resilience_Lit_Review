New graduate nurses face many challenges as they transition into practice. Lacking coping skills, they become stressed and experience symptoms of burnout and an intent to leave. A community hospital implemented a program that included a resilience workshop, group support, and mentoring. A pre–post test design utilized the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale to measure resilience. Findings demonstrated an increase in resilience, thereby highlighting the importance of providing a resiliency program for new graduate nurses.
