ABSTRACTTo contribute to the ongoing discourse about successful programming supporting intermediate behavioral and mental health needs of vulnerable communities affected by disaster, this article presents the Childrenâ€™s Health Fund (CHF) Sandy Recovery and Resiliency Program as a descriptive case study for a multifaceted, community-based approach to building resiliency, coping, and socioemotional skills in an underserved community in New York City that was affected by Superstorm Sandy. The case study involves retrospective review and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data that were collected as part of routine care and program implementation. From the analysis emerged a program consisting of 3 components: (1) delivery of workshops and community events to decrease stigma and build community-wide resilience, (2) delivery of workshops for students and educators in the local school to increase coping skills as well as referrals to clinical mental health care, and (3) provision of mental health care via a mobile mental health clinic. As a result, we found that following periods of excessive trauma, children and families require a broad-based approach to mental health support. Additionally, the use of the mobile clinic abated most common access barriers and served as a proxy of the concern of the organization for the community.
