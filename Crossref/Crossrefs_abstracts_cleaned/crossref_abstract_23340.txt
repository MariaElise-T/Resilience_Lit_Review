Abstract. Disaster-relevant authorities could make uninformed decisions due to the lack of a clear picture of urban
resilience to adverse natural events. Previous studies have seldom examined the
near-real-time human dynamics, which are critical to disaster emergency
response and mitigation, in response to the development and evolution of
mild and frequent rainfall events. In this study, we used the aggregated
Tencent location request (TLR) data to examine the variations in collective
human activities in response to rainfall in 346 cities in China. Then two
resilience metrics, rainfall threshold and response sensitivity, were
introduced to report a comprehensive study of the urban resilience to
rainfall across mainland China. Our results show that, on average, a
1 mm increase in rainfall intensity is associated with a 0.49 % increase
in human activity anomalies. In the cities of northwestern and
southeastern China, human activity anomalies are affected more by rainfall
intensity and rainfall duration, respectively. Our results highlight the
unequal urban resilience to rainfall across China, showing current heavy-rain-warning standards underestimate the impacts of heavy rains on residents in the northwestern arid region and the central underdeveloped areas
and overestimate impacts on residents in the southeastern coastal
area. An overhaul of current heavy-rain-alert standards is therefore needed
to better serve the residents in our study area.
