 Resilience plays a significant role in buffering the negative effects of parenting stress among custodial grandparents. Using a sample of 76 custodial grandparents, this study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the 10-item Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale and to examine the predictors at individual level (demographic characteristics and stress management), interpersonal level (positive social support and negative social support), and community level (formal service use). The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded two factors: adaptability and persistence, and positivity. The findings suggest that low levels of stress management and negative social support may undermine resilience in coping with parenting stress. This study emphasizes the significance of both individual and family interventions in fostering resilience among custodial grandparents by aiding them in building stress management skills and improving the quality of social relationships.
