Most people inhabiting or owning houses in flood-prone areas do not have a prior idea of the situation of the site. The type of flood determines the causes and effects of flooding. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the causes and consequences of flooding in our sites. Both the developer and homeowners after having an in-depth idea of the situation and especially the impact of a particular flood will from the onset decide on whether to go on with the intended idea of development or seek an alternative area. The decision of choices would be taken based on the flood's known effects, causes and professional evaluation. The purpose of this study was to look into the five types of floods alongside their features, and decisions to be taken after evaluation. The scope of the study was to assess the condition of sites regarding floods and a subsequent decision arrived before starting any construction. Data was gathered using the review approach: Books and articles. The knowledge acquired would be relevant in the decision of the end-users or developer to either start construction or abandon the site. In situations where the choice is to start development, further education would be needed on resilience to the specific flood type found in the location. The impact of the study reveals that an estimated cost, time, emotional worries, and resilience techniques would be disclosed before the start of any construction for early decision. However, if the disadvantage of starting the project outweighs the advantages, the best decision is to avoid the site and not start the work
