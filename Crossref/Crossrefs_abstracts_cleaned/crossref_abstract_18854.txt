OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to understand the traumatic stress and resilience of nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19.


BACKGROUND
Studies have shown a high proportion of healthcare workers are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder after a pandemic. Resilience factors are believed to play an important role in the well-being of healthcare professionals.


METHODS
This was a triangulated mixed methods study; a phenomenological qualitative approach with survey data was used to triangulate the findings, and sensemaking was used as the theoretical framework.


RESULTS
Four themes emerged from the study: 1) phases of traumatic stress response to perceived threats; 2) honoring their sacrifice; 3) professional self-identity; and 4) sustaining resilience in a stressful work environment. Quantitative results on traumatic stress, general resilience, and moral resilience supported the themes.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings will help leaders understand the potential for postpandemic mental health problems and the role of resilience in maintaining well-being.
