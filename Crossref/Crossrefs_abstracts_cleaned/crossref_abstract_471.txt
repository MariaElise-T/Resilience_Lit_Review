 This study explores the relationship between self-reported risk behaviors and personal resiliency in adolescents; specifically whether youth with higher personal resiliency report less frequent risk behaviors than those with lower personal resiliency. Self-reported risk behavior is surveyed by the Adolescent Risk Behavior Inventory(ARBI). Self-reported personal resiliency is reflected in responses to the Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents(RSCA). Findings suggest that youth reporting higher personal resiliency report less frequent risk behaviors. The findings suggest the possibility of screening in normative samples of youth in a relatively non-intrusive manner.
