Synthetic pesticides are well-known not just for their efficiency in pest control, but also for their adverse effects on humans, ecology, and living biome's ecological relationships. Biopesticides are biodegradable, environment-friendly, and non-destructive insecticides that are safe for creatures. They leave no harmful residues in food or feed. Botanical, microbiological, and biochemical biopesticides are the three types of biopesticides. 3,000 tons of biopesticides are produced every year, accounting for around 2.5% of the overall pesticide market. Biopesticides are currently accessible in a variety of forms, including dust, granules, powders, emulsions, suspension concentrates, and so on. The Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIBRC) in India requires data on chemistry, bioefficacy, toxicity, packaging, and labeling to register biopesticides. Although India has registered 970 biopesticide products, lesser effectiveness, shorter shelf-life, lack of knowledge, and lengthy registration process remain hurdles. New and improved formulation methods might improve biopesticide efficacies, self-lives, and climate resiliency while lowering prices and making them economically competitive with synthetic chemicals. The main types of biopesticides, their benefits and downsides, worldwide and Indian market scenarios, formulations, registration procedures, and current advancements for users and environment-friendly applications and sustainable agriculture are all covered in this review article.
