 Migrant workers returning home to start businesses has played a strong supporting role in promoting regional poverty alleviation and rural revitalization. How to enhance return migrantsâ€™ entrepreneurial intention is of vital importance. Using survey data on return migrants from many places in China, this article analyzes the mechanism of entrepreneurial resilience, perception of entrepreneurial opportunity and entrepreneurial intention, and the moderating effect of entrepreneurial atmosphere. The results show that entrepreneurial resilience has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial intention; entrepreneurial opportunity perception plays a partial mediating role between entrepreneurial resilience and entrepreneurial intention. In addition, entrepreneurial atmosphere negatively moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial resilience and entrepreneurial intention, and between entrepreneurial resilience and perception of entrepreneurial opportunity. Therefore, we suggest that while creating a good entrepreneurial atmosphere, local governments at all levels in China must also pay attention to avoiding excessive intervention that aggravates the vulnerability of return migrants to entrepreneurship.
