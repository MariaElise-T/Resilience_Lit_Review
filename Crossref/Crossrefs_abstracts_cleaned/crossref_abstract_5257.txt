Abstract
Determination of the Resilient modulusMR for the lime stabilized clay obtained from therepeated loading CBR tests. The main aim of this paper is to prove that CBR repeated test is useful to give an adequate like unconfi ned cyclic triaxial test parameters for design the pavement and subgrade soils. That parameter is the Resilient modulus (MR) which is the elastic modulus based on the recoverable strain under repeated load. Resilient modulus (MR), is an important parameter which characterizes the subgradeâ€™s ability to withstand repetitive stresses under traffic loadings. The 1993 AASHTO guide for design of flexible pavements recommends the use of MR. The additional aim is connected with the concept of sustainable development. For many countries, where resources are at premium, it is very important that stabilized local soil can be used for road construction. For ensuring that stabilized clay can be used for pavement material standard compaction, CBR and repeated CBR tests were performed. In that paper parameter MRof the subgrade lime stabilized clay soil by laboratory CBR repeated test were determined using for calculation formulas from triaxial cyclic test. Based on AASHTO empirical equation the static CBR values using back analysis was also calculated. Finally both values of CBR determined and calculated were compared.
