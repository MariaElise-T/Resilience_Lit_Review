The subgrade soil of asphalt pavement is significantly susceptible to changes in moisture content, and therefore many projects introduce polymer-based reinforcement to ensure soil performance. This paper aims to incorporate a variable representing the dry–wet cycle into the prediction model of resilient modulus of polymer reinforced soil. The polymer adopted is a self-developed subgrade soil solidification material consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyvinyl oxide. The current resilient modulus prediction model is improved, notably involving the effects of the dry–wet cycle. Combined with finite element method (FEM) analysis, the actual stress state of pavement and the coupling effect of dry–wet cycle and vehicle load on the resilient modulus are studied. The deterioration in resilient modulus with the variation in seasonal climate and load response is also investigated. Results show that the deviator stress is negatively correlated with the resilient modulus while the bulk stress has a linearly positive relation. The decreasing rate at low deviator stress is larger than that at the high level. Moreover, the dry–wet cycle can reduce the resilient modulus and the reducing amplitude is the largest at the first dry–wet cycle. FEM analysis shows that the middle position of the subgrade slope has the largest initial resilient modulus with decreasing amplitude in the first year of dry–wet cycles, while the upper position shows a smaller change. The variation in resilient modulus is closely related to the changes in cumulative volumetric water content. Considering that different positions of subgrade bear the external vehicle load, the equivalent resilient modulus is more realistic for guiding the subgrade design.
