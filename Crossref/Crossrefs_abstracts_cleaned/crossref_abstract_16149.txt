AbstractObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the mediating effects of quality of the caregiving relationship and other carer and person with dementia variables in predicting carer resilience over time.MethodCarers of people with mild and moderate dementia in community settings completed baseline (n = 176 dyads) and six‐month follow‐up assessments (n = 139 dyads). Causal mediation analysis was conducted using Pearson Correlation and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine longitudinal predictors of carer resilience, and the effect of several mediating person with dementia, and carer factors on carer resilience over time.ResultsAt 6‐month follow‐up, higher levels of carer resilience were longitudinally correlated with higher ratings of perceived relationship quality by people with dementia (r = 0.53 p ≤ 0.01), and lower levels of emotional distress symptoms by carer's (r = −0.59 p ≤ 0.01). Mediation analyses showed that people with dementia perspectives of the quality of the caregiving relationship mediated the relationship between carer distress specific to neuropsychiatric symptoms (β = −0.32, p ≤ 0.001) and carer resilience (β = 0.53, p ≤ 0.001) over time. The final SEM provided a good fit for the data (X
2 = 0.12, p = 0.72, CFI = 1.00, NFI = 0.99, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.001).ConclusionHigher ratings of perceived relationship quality by people with dementia, and lower levels of carer emotional distress predicted higher carer resilience at follow‐up. People with dementia perspectives of the quality of the caregiving relationship mediated the relationship between carer distress specific to neuropsychiatric symptoms and carer resilience over time. Our findings indicate that interventions aimed at strengthening the caregiving relationship might have a protective long‐term effect for carer resilience in dementia caregiving.
