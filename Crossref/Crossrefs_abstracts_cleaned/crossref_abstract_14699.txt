AbstractAdaptive management practices that maximize yields while improving yield resilience are required in the face of resource variability and climate change. Ecological intensification such as organic farming and cover cropping are lauded in some studies for fostering yield resilience, but subject to criticism in others for their low productivity. We implemented a quantitative framework to assess yield resilience, emphasizing four aspects of yield dynamics: yield, yield stability, yield resistance (i.e., the ability of systems to avoid crop failure under stressful growing conditions), and maximum yield potential. We compared the resilience of maize-tomato rotation systems after 24 years of irrigated organic, cover cropped, and conventional management in a Mediterranean climate, and identified crop-specific resilience responses of tomato and maize to three management systems. Organic management maintained tomato yields comparable to those under conventional management, while increasing yield stability and resistance. However, organic and cover cropped system resulted in 36.1% and 35.8% lower maize yields and reduced yield stability and resistance than the conventional system. Our analyses suggest that investments in ecological intensification approaches could potentially contribute to long-term yield resilience, however, these approaches need to be tailored for individual crops and systems to maximize their benefits, rather than employing one-size-fits-all approaches.
