Russia, under the current unfavorable conditions, needs to develop optimal algorithms for managing economic systems in the face of different risk factors, including natural, man-made, or military factors. This article proposes an approach to managing economic resilience in three spaces: “resilience –efficiency”, “risk – efficiency” and “chance – efficiency”. The results of three approaches to managing resilience are presented and compared. In the “resilience – efficiency” space, the resilience of a company is described using the fuzzy-parabolic R-lens technology. The “risk – efficiency” and “chance – efficiency” spaces describe optimal solutions as a set of non-dominating alternatives, united by a fuzzy-parabolic efficient frontier of a portfolio of solutions. Companies can control their economic resilience in different scenarios and act according to a predefined plan in case of temporary loss of resilience. This research utilizes methods from fuzzy set theory and soft computing, which is a unique proposed technology for ensuring economic resilience in complex operating systems, such as regions of the Russian Federation currently affected by full-scale military actions.
