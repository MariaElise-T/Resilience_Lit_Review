 Marginalized older adults are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to social isolation and physical and functional limitations. Despite these stressors, they appear to be resilient by leveraging individual, community, and societal resources. This study conducted in-depth interviews with marginalized older adults to understand how COVID-19 affected their mobility and daily lives. We also identified different levels of protective factors affecting their resiliency to pandemic stressors. COVID-19 influenced not only the physical health but also the mental health of older adults. However, they overcame adversity by using technology to continue daily activities, exchanging informal support with family and neighbors, relying on formal support from community organizations, and keeping themselves physically active in their neighborhoods. Our findings suggest a holistic approach to enhance the resilience of older adults during an unprecedented event.
