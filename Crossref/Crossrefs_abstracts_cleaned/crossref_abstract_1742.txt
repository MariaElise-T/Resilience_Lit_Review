 The construct of resilience is key to understanding adaptation to disability from a strengths-based perspective. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of factors identified in Kumpferâ€™s resilience model on quality of life (QOL) outcomes for adults with spinal cord injury (SCI), specifically taking into account injury characteristics, self-efficacy, resiliency characteristics, and social support using hierarchical regression analysis. Participants included 255 adults with SCI. Findings revealed that the overall model accounted for 75% of the variance in QOL outcomes. In particular, coexisting pain, participation self-efficacy, core self-evaluation, resiliency characteristics, cognitive strength, general health, and social support independently contributed to the variance in QOL scores. Implications of these findings for developing theory-driven, strengths-based approaches for improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with SCI are discussed.
