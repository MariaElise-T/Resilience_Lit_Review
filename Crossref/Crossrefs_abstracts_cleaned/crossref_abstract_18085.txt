Three optimization models were developed to manage operations in intermodal logistics networks, from routine scheduling delay to recovery from major disruptions. Efficient transfer coordination in intermodal logistics networks can reduce the freight dwell time at transfer terminals where various routes interconnect and can reduce storage requirements at terminals. The first model coordinated vehicle schedules and cargo transfers at intermodal freight terminals, primarily by optimizing coordinated service frequencies and slack times. When delay perturbations propagated within a logistics network that used schedule coordination, a second model determined whether each ready outbound vehicle should have been dispatched immediately or held to wait for late incoming vehicles. Finally, a set of optimal resilient actions was considered by the proposed third model during the postdisruption phases, such as switching shipping modes and routes, renting other carriers' capacities, reallocating local trucks, and prioritizing the order of shipments because of limited capacities.
