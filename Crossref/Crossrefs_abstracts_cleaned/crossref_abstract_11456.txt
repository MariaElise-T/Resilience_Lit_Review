In an environment characterized by fragile prospects and the predominance of downside risks, the issue of organizational resilience is receiving increasing attention in the field of management research. Indeed, the repercussions of uncertain reality prompt us to investigate the role of CSR in the development of organizational resilience of Moroccan companies. In this regard, the ultimate goal of this communication is to examine the relationship between CSR and organizational resilience in the Moroccan context. Our papers examines the effect of CSR determinants on the three dimensions of organizational resilience of companies, while highlighting the moderating role of the size of the company in question. An empirical study conducted on 80 Moroccan companies allowed us to confirm the significant causal relationship between CSR and organizational resilience in our sample, and showed that there is a significant and positive moderation effect between CSR and only the absorptive capacity of the surveyed companies. The results of our investigation have allowed us to derive managerial implications and highlight the importance of a societal orientation of companies to confront the future environment.
