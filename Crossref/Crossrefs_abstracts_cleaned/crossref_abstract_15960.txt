Abstract

Objective
The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between psychological resilience and social support and anxiety in obstetric nurses and to provide theoretical basis for improving the mental health of obstetric nurses.


Methods
In this study, 190 obstetric nurses were included, using the general information questionnaire and The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Social Support Rating Scale, and survey of Self-evaluation of Anxiety Scale.


Results
There are differences in the type of work and the score of psychological resilience (P
<0.05), obstetric nurses’ resilience score was 65.58±10.65; self-rating anxiety score of obstetric nurses was 36.89±6.87; and social support score of obstetric nurses was 44.37±7.86. The psychological elasticity score and anxiety were negatively related (P
<0.01), whereas the resilience score and total score of social support were positively related (P
<0.01).


Conclusions
Obstetric nurses have many responsibilities and stress. Nursing managers should focus on obstetric nurses’ mental health, lighten the obstetric nurses’ anxiety, and thus improve their mental flexibility and optimize the quality of nursing service better, with more passion into work.
