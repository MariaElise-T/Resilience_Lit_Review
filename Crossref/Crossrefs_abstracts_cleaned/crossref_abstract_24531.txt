AbstractResilience is a dynamic process that enables organisms to cope with demanding environments. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between resilience and functional connectivities (FCs) within the default mode network (DMN). Considering the on-demand recruitment process of resilience, dynamic changes in FCs during cognitive load increases may reflect essential aspects of resilience. We compared DMN FC changes in resting and task states and their association with resilience. Eighty-nine healthy volunteers completed the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and an fMRI with an auditory oddball task. The fMRI time series was divided into resting and task periods. We focused on FC changes between the latter half of the resting period and the former half of the task phase (switching), and between the former and latter half of the task phase (sustaining). FCs within the ventral DMN significantly increased during “switching” and decreased during “sustaining”. For FCs between the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate and the parahippocampal cortex, increased FC during switching was negatively correlated with CD-RISC scores. In individuals with higher resilience, ventral DMN connectivities were more stable and homeostatic in the face of cognitive demand. The dynamic profile of DMN FCs may represent a novel biomarker of resilience.
