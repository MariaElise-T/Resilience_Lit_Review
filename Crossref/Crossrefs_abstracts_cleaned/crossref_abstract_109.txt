 This study applied the construct of resilience to family systems by looking at ways families are able to maintain high functioning despite facing difficult experiences. A mixed methods study tested relationships between the variables of risk, family strengths, and family functioning. Quantitative findings suggested that the variable of family strengths predicted higher levels of family functioning than the level of family risk. A subsample of 6 families participated in in-depth family interviews. Narrative analysis uncovered the presence of 10 family strengths as well as a process through which these strengths were important in the experience of family resilience. This article presents a model of the process. The quantitative and qualitative research supports the usefulness of identifying and building upon family strengths.
