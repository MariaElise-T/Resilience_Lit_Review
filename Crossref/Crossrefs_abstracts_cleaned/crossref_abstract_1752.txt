The COVID-19 pandemic has promoted the theoretical exploration of building "resilient cities" in China according to Foucault's theory of positive biopolitics. From the perspective of constructive biopolitics, China's anti-epidemic measures with a top priority on the protection of human life have achieved good results. Its measures against COVID-19 lead to effective epidemic prevention activities through constructive biopolitics, and discipline individual behavior to deal with exceptional states with the political effects of medical science. In the construction of social responsibility and ethical care for "resilient cities" in the epidemic and even post-epidemic era, China not only needs enough respect for life and health, carries out microscopic governance with cities as the unit to standardize individual behavior and social order, but also promotes the modernization of national governance capacity and governance system as a whole with sustainable development as the value goal.
