Abstract
Research over time has revealed that activity spaces in domestic home have undergone evolution, adaptation and resilience over the years across Benin residential zones, Nigeria. Space segments/activities sections like cooking/eating, household goods storage, visitors and conveniences sections have somehow remain unchanged in terms of function, meaning, and arrangement. The study identified socio-cultural factors as responsible for resilience of domestic space to change in Benin domestic architecture across Benin City. The paper engaged both qualitative and quantitative research method. Triangulation was adopted for collection through focused group discussion using Semi-structured interview guide, questionnaire, observation guide and photographs. Factor analysis was use to analysis of data in order to reduce the identified socio-cultural factors to sizeable portion. The finding showed that, whilst some activity space, it size and location have evolved in Benin contemporary architecture, the style has remained intact. For instance some activity spaces in some residential zone of the city have been adapted to suit the new realities. Further observation itemised the socio-cultural factors that are responsible for resilient to change in Benin domestic architecture. Result of research underscores the role of culture in process of architectural development amidst rapid urbanization. Research upon completion is expected to be a good case study for measuring resilience to evolution of spaces in typical house setting in any African traditional city.
