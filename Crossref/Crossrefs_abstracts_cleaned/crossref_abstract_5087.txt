This study retrospectively explores the strategies employed by U.S. companies to ensure business continuity in the face of disruptions within their supply chains. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of various resilience strategies adopted by American businesses and to derive insights that can inform future supply chain management practices. The problem addressed in this study was the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to disruptions, including natural disasters, global pandemics, and geopolitical tensions. These disruptions could result in significant economic losses and operational challenges for businesses. Understanding how U.S. companies tackled these challenges in the past provides valuable lessons for enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve these objectives, a mixed-methods research approach was employed. Quantitative data were collected through surveys distributed to a diverse sample of U.S. companies across different industries. Qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews with supply chain and operations managers from a subset of these companies. The study analyzed historical cases of supply chain disruptions and the corresponding strategies used to mitigate their impact. Findings from this research indicate that U.S. companies employed a combination of strategies to enhance supply chain resilience, including diversifying suppliers, leveraging technology for real-time visibility, and implementing risk management frameworks. Companies that had robust business continuity plans in place were better equipped to respond to disruptions effectively. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical importance of proactive supply chain resilience strategies in mitigating the impact of disruptions. The lessons learned from past disruptions provide valuable insights for companies seeking to build more resilient supply chains in the future. Recommendations include the development and regular testing of robust business continuity plans, the adoption of digital technologies for enhanced visibility, and a proactive approach to risk management. By drawing from past experiences, U.S. companies can better prepare for and respond to future disruptions, ultimately ensuring the continuity of their operations and safeguarding their competitiveness in an ever-changing business landscape.
