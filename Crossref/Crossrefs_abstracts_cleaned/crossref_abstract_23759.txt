Results: High levels of resilience and between medium to high emotional intelligence; significant, positive and high relationship between emotional intelligence and resilience. Both in the emotional regulation variable and in the emotional intelligence variable significant differences were found regarding sex and specialty. The results of the predictive model with all emotional intelligence variables as predictors explained 43.5% of the observed variability of resilience.
