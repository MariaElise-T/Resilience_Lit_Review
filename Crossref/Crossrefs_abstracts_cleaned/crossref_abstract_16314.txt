With the rapid development of urbanization, Chinaâ€™s security system in ports is facing many problems and challenges, especially after the outbreak of COVID-19 has made a great impact on China. In order to avoid the serious losses caused by safety problems in ports under major emergencies due to the lack of necessary, forward-looking prevention in the increasingly complex system of ports, this paper introduced the theory of safety resilience into the field of ports for the first time and proposed a triangle model of safety resilience in ports, which included three elements: the disaster system, the disaster bearing system and the safety resilience management. Aiming at the quantitative evaluation demands of safety resilience in ports, the system evaluation indexes of safety resilience in ports were established, including 6 secondary indexes and 37 tertiary indexes. The theory of entropy weight based on normalization standard processing was used to calculate and analyze the importance of each index, and the influence weight value of each index on safety resilience and the prediction curve chart of safety resilience in ports were obtained. The research results can provide a reference for the capacity construction and application of safety resilience in ports, which will effectively solve the new challenges faced by port safety at this stage and help to improve the ability of the port not only in disaster prevention and mitigation but also in disaster recovery and continuous improvement.
