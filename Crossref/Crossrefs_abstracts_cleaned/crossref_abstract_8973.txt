The article deals with the problem of resilience and the study of its relationship with trust in adolescents who find themselves in a difficult life situation. Based on the theoretical analysis, it is revealed that resilience and trust in yourself and others are the most important intrapersonal resources that help teenagers overcome difficult circumstances and build their own life strategy. The paper presents the results of an empirical study aimed at identifying a direct / feedback relationship between resilience and trust in adolescents who find themselves in difficult life situations. The correlation between self-confidence and others ' trust and resilience components (engagement, control, and risk-taking) was revealed. It is established that the resilience of adolescents in difficult life situations is positively associated with self-confidence in the intellectual and professional sphere, and increases due to the strategy of involvement and control. The interest and passion of a teenager in intellectual and professional activities, getting satisfaction from the result, has a positive impact on the development of their resilience and self-confidence. However, there is a negative relationship between the resilience of adolescents and trust in others, which is due to insufficient emotional experience with loved ones. A strong correlation between the level of self-confidence and the resilience component "control" has shown that such teenagers tend to feel in control of what is happening, they choose active activities and struggle, which helps them cope with stress. At the same time, the higher the level of risk acceptance among teenagers as a component of resilience, the more difficult it is for them to trust themselves in establishing relationships with relatives and friends, in solving everyday problems and in organizing leisure and recreation, which negatively affects their internal state in the form of tension, anxiety and discomfort.
