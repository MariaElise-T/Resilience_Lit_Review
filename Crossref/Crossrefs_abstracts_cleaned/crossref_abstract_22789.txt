 Purpose: This study investigated the relationship between nursing students’ profile variables and their state of mental well-being and resilience during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and how this impacts their understanding of holistic nursing care provision. Design: This study used a cross-sectional design and total enumeration sample ( n = 439) from all enrolled nursing students in the College of Nursing of a state-run university. Method: The 10-item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and 14-item Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) were used to collect data from the participants. A correlational analysis was employed to determine the relationship between the responses of the participants to their profile variables. Findings: There were no significant differences in age, gender, and year level in the 10-item CD-RISC and WEMWBS. Regarding the WEMWBS, the mean total score of those with 61–100% of the allowed units was significantly higher than those with 31–60%. Finally, the CD-RISC scores revealed that participants with a general point average (GPA) of A were significantly higher than those with a GPA of B+ or B. Conclusion: Academically performing students (those with a GPA of B and above) are more resilient. In addition, there is an existing linear relationship between high mental well-being and the ability to pursue higher academic loads.
