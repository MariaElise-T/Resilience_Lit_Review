AbstractPurposeTo examine and identify the factors influencing the degree of resilience among Korean burn patients.DesignA cross‐sectional descriptive design was employed.MethodsThe study sample consisted of 138 burn patients recovering from the acute phase in H hospital, Seoul. The male patient participants numbered 93 (67.4%) and the female participants numbered 45 (32.6%). The average age of the participants was 46.79 years. Measures used were the Beck Depression Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, self‐esteem scale, family support scale, and resilience scale.FindingsThe analyses showed that the prediction model for resilience among burn patients was significant (F = 33.94, p < .001). The value of the adjusted R2 was 0.492, which corresponds to the explanatory power of 49.2%. The factor that was found to have the most influence on resilience among burn patients was self‐esteem (β = .35), followed by family support (β = .29).ConclusionsThis study provides preliminary evidence that self‐esteem is a major and primary predictor of resilience among burn patients, next followed by family support.Clinical RelevanceIn the nursing practice, nurses need to pay attention to the burn patient's self‐esteem and family support. Concrete interventions and strategies to improve the resilience of burn patients are needed.
