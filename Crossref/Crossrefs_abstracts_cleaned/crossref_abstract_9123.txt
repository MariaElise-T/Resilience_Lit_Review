The pandemic phenomenon encourages the acceleration of the application of digitalization in various sectors. Technological developments play a role in providing added value for business organizations to produce more effective, efficient, fast and agile performance.  Investment diversification is needed so that investors remain resilient to uncertainty or rapid environmental changes that affect the investment value. Based on dynamic capability theory, digital transformation is a trigger for the creation of dynamic capabilities and is an innovation process of enterprise integration. Ambidextrous capabilities of an organization include exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. The experimental approach,  will try to analyze various types of investment platforms to find out how they compare in each of the different investment platforms. Quantitative method was used to determine the level of influence of digital transformation on ambidextrous innovation both exploitation  and exploration , and the influence level of ambidextrous innovation on personal resilience. The experimental research process was conducted by distributing questionnaires to obtain primary data. The collected data was analyzed using smartPLS. The results of this study indicated that the hypothesis H1a  and H1b has a P value of 0.000 so that it is proven to support the existing hypothesis. Then the P value H2a  and  H2b can be accepted and supports the hypothesis.  The third hypothesis H3 with a p value of 0.030. Based on the five hypotheses, the result shows the most significant and strong influence in influencing the variable ambidexterity of innovation is digital transformation.
