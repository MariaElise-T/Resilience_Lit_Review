Composite services are regarded as essential components of a cloud-based manufacturing (CM) system. Different classes of disruptive events which are rooted in the uncertainties of the supply and demand sides of CM threaten the resilience and continuity of the composite services over time. The present article proposes a resilience measure based on a generic system resilience metric along with a two-step method based on MCDM and SIS-Monte-Carlo to quantify the resilience of CM composite services by considering recovery time objective (RTO). To present the applicability of the proposed method, a numerical example was designed and simulated. The results showed that the resilience of composite service is sensitive to geographical distance, RTO, and quality of recovery.
