AbstractObjectiveThe palliative journey can be emotionally stressful for both patients with advanced cancer and their families. Psychological resilience is crucial in aiding with patients' adaptation and post‐traumatic growth. The aim of this systematic review was to critically examine the definitions of psychological resilience and its associated factors in palliative patients with advanced cancer.MethodsFour databases were systematically searched from inception to August 2020. Both qualitative and quantitative studies that examined factors associated with psychological resilience in a sample of patients with advanced cancer undergoing palliative care were included.ResultsA total of 15 studies met the criteria, of which 10 were qualitative and five were quantitative. Nine studies included a definition of psychological resilience, from which five common themes of buffering, adaptation, resources, recovery, and growth were derived. The quantitative studies found association between resilience and hope, independence, social support, fatigue, emotional distress, and coping strategies. The qualitative studies reported additional sources of resilience such as spirituality, social support, prior experience dealing with illness and life adversity, meaning‐making, reconciling with life's finiteness, acceptance of illness, control, determination, positive attitude, dignity, engagement with palliative care and quality of life being supported by palliative care.ConclusionsMore research is needed for developing an overarching definition of psychological resilience in palliative advanced cancer patients that acknowledges and appreciates the contextual sensitivity of this concept among different cultural groups. Further studies are also needed to examine a holistic range of bio‐psycho‐socio‐spiritual factors associated with psychological resilience among these patients and their families.
