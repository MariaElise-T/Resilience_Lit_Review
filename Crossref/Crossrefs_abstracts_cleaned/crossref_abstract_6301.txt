By analyzing survey data collected from 2,002 participants in 5 generational cohorts in the United States, this study examines generational differences in information and communication technology (ICT) and social media use behaviors. The intersection between digital divide theory and generational cohort theory provides the theoretical foundation for this study. There are two major findings. First, there are significant differences in ICT use among 5 different generations (Generation Z, Generation Y, Generation X, Boomers, Silent Generation). In terms of ICT access and use, the silent generation is left behind other generations. Thus, the grey divide still exists. Second, different generations have different preferences for social media platforms. For example, more Generation Z participants use Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram. This study brings additional insights into generational differences/divide in ICT and social media use. Practical suggestions are provided to narrow the generational divide and to foster communicative resilience among different generations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
