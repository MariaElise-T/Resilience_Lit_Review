The changes in social interaction in the family have triggered the families to be single-parent over time, therefore the research objective is to identify the risks and resilience in households headed by women in a disadvantaged population in North Lima. It is a non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional quantitative study with a total population of 220 female heads of households. In the results, the test used is the Spearman correlation. The Resilience variable is positively related to total family risk (rho=0.236; p<0.01) and satisfaction with life (rho=0.435; p<0.01). Likewise, the total family risk is positively related to life satisfaction (rho=0.420; p<0.01). In conclusion, strategies for family solidification should be sought since this will allow increasing the intra-family relationship indexes.
