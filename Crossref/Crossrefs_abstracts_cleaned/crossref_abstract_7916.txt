Abstract
This study explores the causal elements of resiliency and continuity in a Chinese school located on the southern island of the Philippines, Mindanao. Established by the Huaren community in Iligan City in the 1930s, the changing political, economic, and socio-cultural landscape of the country over the years since 1948 has brought about challenges and changes to the school. The presence of an “alien” minority whose: (1) commercial endeavors were perceived to be gaining control of the country’s economy, (2) strong cultural ties from their country of origin creates a degree of social separateness from the native population, and (3) political loyalty was questioned (as exemplified during the “Red Scare” Syndrome) were among the concerns that coincided with the resurgence of Filipino nationalism, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. The passage of “nationalization” laws placed restrictions and curtailments on foreign control in the country, and the Chinese school in Iligan was not exempted from the measures instituted by the Philippine government. But despite such measures, the school has continued to serve its purpose as an academic institution that not only educates young minds with basic educational training but also contributes to the preservation of the Chinese language and culture in the community. It remains and continues to serve the community as the only foreign-language school in the city.
