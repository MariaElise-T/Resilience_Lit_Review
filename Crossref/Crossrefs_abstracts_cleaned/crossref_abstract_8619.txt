In 2019, the University of the West Indies Centre for Disability Studies (UWICDS) released the results of the first Regional Disability Index (RDI). The RDI was developed with the primary aim to track and rank countries within the Caribbean in terms of their efforts to implement the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and by extension, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The RDI used a quantitative methodological framework employing a survey among government and non-governmental organizations catering to persons with disabilities in the Anglophone Caribbean to capture the data. In this paper, this researcher conducts an assessment of the major findings of the RDI in the context of building resilience among persons with disabilities in certain fundamental areas of Caribbean life. Findings relating to legislative protection, education, employment, public transportation, health care, and access to information are highlighted. The RDI, among other things, revealed that St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the top country in the Anglophone Caribbean in terms of their efforts to implement programmes and policies for persons with disabilities. We compare and contrast the findings regionally to that which is taking place in the global landscape for persons with disabilities.
