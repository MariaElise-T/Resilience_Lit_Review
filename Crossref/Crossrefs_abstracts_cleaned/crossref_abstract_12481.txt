Future battlefield situations in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are expected to increase the dependence on network systems. In these situations, the impact of the system could lead to a defeat on the battlefield. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to recognize the importance of the resilience of network systems, identify the factors that can increase the resilience of the system, and present improvements.
Unlike in previous studies that were focused on technology improvement and development for applying the technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the defense sector in the future, in this study, resilience is considered. Four components of resilience, depending on the specificity of the defense sector, are proposed for the introduction/design phase of the network system, serving as a starting point for implementing a high-quality system by specifically considering problems and improvements.
