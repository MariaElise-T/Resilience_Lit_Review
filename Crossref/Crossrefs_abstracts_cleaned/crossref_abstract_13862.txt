The PSS-14 was used to assess perceived stress. Resilience was investigated using CD-RISC-25 and spirituality using DSES. Also APACHE II was used to assesses the severity of the disease and the outcome of patients admitted to the ICU. Results: Resilience is significantly correlated with the scales of perceived stress (p <0.001) and daily spirituality (p = 0.019). On the contrary, the more their daily spirituality, the greater their resilience.In the present study no significant association was found between the DSES and the PSS-14.
