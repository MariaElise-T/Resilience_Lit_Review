The FRIENDS for Life programme is a cognitive behavioural based programme designed to reduce childhood anxiety and promote emotional resilience. Teachers are in a unique position to monitor children who are at risk and to intervene early with preventive social and emotional learning programmes. This study was designed to replicate very positive international evaluations of the FRIENDS for Life programme for anxiety reduction and extend the evidence base by investigating effects on strengths based qualities such as self-concept, coping and school connectedness. Further, for the first time in an Irish context primary school teachers were the lead facilitators of the programme, with 709 children aged 9 to 13 years in a representative sample of 27 primary schools from across Ireland. Schools were allocated to an intervention group or a wait-listed control group. Teachers were trained and supported to deliver the programme by educational psychologists. Quantitative and qualitative data including measures of anxiety, self-concept, coping, school connectedness and social validity indicated that the FRIENDS for Life programme was very positively received by children, parents and teachers. The programme was implemented successfully by teachers and resulted in positive outcomes for students including improved emotional wellbeing, greater coping skills and an enhanced sense of connectedness with school.
