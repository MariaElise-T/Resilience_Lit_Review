The current study intended to find out the role of resilience on perceived public stigma and burden among primary caregivers of the psychiatric patients. The current study highlighted the psychological health of caregivers. A cross sectional study was conducted in region of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. A total of 250 caregivers participated in the study, whom 125 were male and 125 were female caregivers, age range was 25-60 years (M=31.61, SD=5.93). The data was collected from public and private hospitals.  Three scales were used for data collection. The resilience was measured through Urdu translated resilience scale, public stigma was assessed by using Urdu version of perceived public stigma, and Burden was measured through interview.  The result showed that resilience was negatively associated with burden and perceived public stigma (p< 0.01). Further, the multiple regression showed that resilience acted as moderator between public stigma and burden (? = -1.02, p< .001). The result supported a positive association between public stigma, burden and resilience among caregivers of psychiatric patients.
