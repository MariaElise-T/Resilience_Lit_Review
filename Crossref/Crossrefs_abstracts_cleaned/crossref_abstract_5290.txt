Abstract
With global warming already underway and the sense of urgency around climate breakdown growing, delivery of a resilient built environment is critical. Town planners are crucial intermediaries in this work but there is little recent work in the UK exploring their role in climate change resilience. In addressing the gap, the objective of the study was to examine resilience and professional identity of town planners. Interviews were conducted with 19 planners working in England who had at least seven years’ experience. Thematic analysis of the data found a strong professional and public service identity but little awareness of resilience. Many participants were unfamiliar with the concept, with the exception of specific actions such as planning for flood protection, and almost none were aware of resilience thinking incorporating conceptualisation of places as complex, interconnected, dynamic systems. We conclude that the built environment in England is not being prepared for imminent and future climate risks, and that the gaps on climate-resilience pose a threat to the profession’s jurisdiction.
