This research paper delves into the thematic exploration of gender identity, female resilience, and the subversion of societal norms in Mahasweta Devi's collection of translated stories, Till Death Do Us Part. The collection spans over thirty years and encompasses five stories: "The Divorce", "The Saga of Kagaboga", "The Poet's Wife", “He, said Pani”, and, “Love Story”. In these narratives, Mahasweta Devi deviates from the conventional satirical and socially-critical writing style and shows extraordinary sensitivity in the portrayal of her characters. The stories are centered on the lives of five elderly women who struggle with several challenges and societal constraints. Simultaneously, they diligently explore unconventional approaches to contest prevailing norms and masculine hegemony. This research study aims to dissect these distinctive qualities in Devi's storytelling within the context of her collection, “Till Death Do Us Part”.
