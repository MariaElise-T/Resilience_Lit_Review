Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to present a concept of informational capital to explain the interplay between social capital and information technology in community-based disaster management. It aims to discuss the role and formation of informational capital in community disaster resilience.Design/methodology/approach– Based on an exploratory case study focusing on the 2010 eruption of Merapi volcano in Central Java, Indonesia, the paper seeks to analyse the emergence of disaster response fully organized by grassroots groups in Yogyakarta. In advancing the concept of informational capital, this paper analyses how the grassroots groups were able to mobilize resources for disaster mitigation, through which social capital became the foundation of community-based disaster response and recovery. Furthermore, the mobilization of social capital was significantly enhanced by mutual interactions facilitated by the use of information technology. This is evident in the role of Jalin Merapi, a web-based organization formed to respond to the crisis after the volcano eruption.Findings– The concept of informational capital revolves around the ways in which social capital and information act as crucial assets when a disaster strikes. Through informational capital, strong community bonds and ties are transformed into organized information that effectively facilitates collective action to face the emergency crisis.Originality/value– This paper presents a new concept of informational capital and highlights its key role in facilitating disaster management processes and contribution to community disaster resilience.
