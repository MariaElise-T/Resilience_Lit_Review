The focus of this contribution is on the psychosocial well‚Äêbeing, health, and functioning of communities in the context of major crises. A multilayered psychosocial resilience framework is described, conceptualizing and connecting capacities at individual, community, and society levels. Effective crisis management is strengthening and utilizing these capacities. The community as a resilient, functioning social system depends, almost by definition, on collaboration among government, business, and civil society. Yet while resilience and crisis management form a logical combination, resilience for its part is depoliticized and naturalizing, whereas crisis management can be controversial and politically intense, which in practice means crisis management might negatively affect the development of more resilient communities.
