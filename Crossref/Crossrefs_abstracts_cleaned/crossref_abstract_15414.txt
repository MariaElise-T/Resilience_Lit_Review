Abstract
 There are several trends of development of modern reliability theory; some of them are subjects of everyday engineering activity, like: quality control of mass production or “pure” reliability. But most of these issues, such as: effectiveness, survivability, safety, security, are currently the subject of many works of conceptual, modeling, case study or survey nature. The aim of this article is show how the performance requirements of technical objects were supplemented with: customer expectations (quality), abilities to prevent the loss of the object properties in operation time (reliability and maintainability), the effects of undesirable events and protection against them (safety and security) and the ability to restore performance (resilience).
