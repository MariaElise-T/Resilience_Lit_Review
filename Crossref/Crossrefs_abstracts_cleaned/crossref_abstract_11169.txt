This study assesses the online societal association of leaders and healthcare organizations from the top-10 COVID-19 resilient nations through public engagement, sentiment strength, and inclusivity and diversity strength. After analyzing 173,071 Tweets authored by the leaders and health organizations, our findings indicate that United Arab Emirateâ€™s Prime Minister had the highest online societal association (normalized online societal association: 1.000) followed by the leaders of Canada and Turkey (normalized online societal association: 0.068 and 0.033, respectively); and among the healthcare organizations, the Public Health Agency of Canada was the most impactful (normalized online societal association: 1.000) followed by the healthcare agencies of Turkey and Spain (normalized online societal association: 0.632 and 0.094 respectively). In comparison to healthcare organizations, the leaders displayed a strong awareness of individual factors and generalized their Tweets to a broader audience. The findings also suggest that users prefer accessing social media platforms for information during health emergencies and that leaders and healthcare institutions should realize the potential to use them effectively.
