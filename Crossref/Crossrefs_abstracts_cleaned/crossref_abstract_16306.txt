 Bridge structures are the important part of lifeline engineering, which are easy to lose their traffic function when subjected to strong earthquakes. Seismic resilient bridge structures are that do not require repair or can be restored to normal operating condition with minor repair after an earthquake, which are mainly characterized by self-centering capacity, damage control capacity and easy repair. Therefore, the bridge structures with seismic resilience have become one of the research hotspots in bridge engineering due to the excellent characteristics. This paper firstly reviews the development of bridge seismic design theory, and then highlights the current status of research on bridge structures with seismic resilience. The seismic resilient bridge structures are divided into rocking bridges, bridges with replaceable members and bridges with high-performance materials, according to the method to achieve the performance recovery of bridge structures. Then the research status of these three kinds of seismic resilient bridge structures is reviewed and summarized systematically. A large number of experimental studies and numerical simulations have presented that the seismic resilient bridge structures have excellent performance recovery capability. In addition, this paper also summarizes the current research status of performance evaluation and design methods of seismic resilient bridge structures, and presents practical engineering applications of typical seismic resilient bridge structures. Finally, the future research directions and development trends of seismic resilient bridge structures are prospected.
