This brief research report aimed to explore the concept of pedagogical resilience and how teachers in Thailand and the Philippines build resilience in pedagogy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing the qualitative research design, the data were obtained from the focus group discussion (FGD) and semi-structured interviews with 12 teachers, 8 of whom were from 1 of the universities in the Philippines and another four teachers from a university in Thailand. The thematic analysis revealed that pedagogical resilience is influenced by teachersâ€™ personal, professional, and social attitudes toward teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although teachers acknowledged that they had no experience in remote and online teaching, they demonstrated resiliency by being flexible and adaptive to the situation. Such an attitude allowed them to build a relationship with their colleagues and design teaching and learning pedagogy that addresses the issues in their online and remote teaching. The findings provide a clear understanding of the conceptualization of pedagogical resilience from the perspectives of teachers in the Philippines and Thailand.
