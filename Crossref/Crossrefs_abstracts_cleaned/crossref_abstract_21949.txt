The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of digital transformation measured by digital intensity and transformation management intensity on dimensions of organizational resilience, including situational awareness, management of keystone vulnerabilities, and adaptive capacities in Vietnamese commercial banks. This study surveyed 412 employees from 17 Vietnamese joint stock commercial banks from January 2022 to May 2022 and employed structural equation modeling (SEM).

These findings provide several practical implications for Vietnamese commercial banks.
