Introduction: Resilience is the ability to adapt or recover after adverse situations.This study aimed to adapt and investigate evidence of the validity of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) for the Brazilian context. Method: The total sample comprised 1,937 people who participated in the study and the validity analysis was carried out with 1,480 people between 18 and 78 years of age. It was carried out using translation, back-translation, descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, the ROC curve and BRS correlation with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale - 10-item version (CD-RISC-10), the Social Support Perception Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire - 2-item version (PHQ-2), and sociodemographic data. Results: The results showed the adequacy of the Brazilian version of the BRS (BRS-BR), alpha of 0.80, omega = 0.81, one factor, good information capacity of the items (except for item 5) and correlation with the CD-RISC-10 (rho = 0.64), PHQ-2 (rho = - 0.38)and Social Support (rho = 0.14). There was also a correlation with sex (rho = 0.11), age (rho = 0.13), marital status (rho = 0.15) and schooling (rho = 0.15). The ROC curve shows a cutoff point at 10 points for low resilience and 21 points for high resilience. Conclusions: The investigation of the psychometric characteristics of the BRS-BR showed that the instrument can be useful for the evaluation of resilience in the Brazilian context.
