PurposeThe purpose of this research is to study the impact of talent management practices on organizational resilience in Tunisian firms in times of the sanitary crises due to COVID-19.Design/methodology/approachA hypothetico-deductive approach is adopted. First, it is hypothesized that four talent management practices positively affect organizational resilience. Then, the hypotheses were tested by using quantitative methods. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed with PLS-SEM techniques.FindingsResults show that talent identification positively affects organizational resilience operationalized through the three dimensions of agility, integrity and robustness. Talent development and talent succession planning positively influence the firms' agility only, whilst talent retention had no effect on the three organizational resilience dimensions.Practical implicationsThe findings of this research may be helpful for human resources managers to recognize among talent management practices those that are mostly associated with organizational resilience and its dimensions. This could help them revise some talent management practices and implement those that are lacking to ensure strong and resilient firms, especially in a context characterized by the occurrence of crises of different natures.Originality/valueThe literature review showed that talent management practices and organizational resilience relationships are understudied. This research empirically highlights the relevance of the linkage between them. It contributes to the rare existent works by identifying a significant effect of talent identification on all organizational resilience dimensions and a positive effect of talent development and succession planning on agility.
