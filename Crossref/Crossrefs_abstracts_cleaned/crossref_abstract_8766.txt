In this article, we analyze the resilience of older adults and its probable predictors. Among predictors that affect the individual level of a personâ€™s resilience in older age, we consider the participation in different types of activities and personal coping strategies to respond to challenges through the life-course. The article presents the results of a correlation analysis of resilience with the financial, consumer and labor behavior of older adults. We have revealed that the types of financial and consumer behavior, information and communication practices significantly differ for individuals with different resilience levels. Constructive coping with the new conditions and requirements for the well-being allows older adults to maintain a high level of resilience and participation in society. Older people, focused on mastering new skills for a successful life in a changing world, have high indicators of resilience, focus on self-confidence, energy, preventive overcoming of difficulties, have low rates of catastrophic situations.
