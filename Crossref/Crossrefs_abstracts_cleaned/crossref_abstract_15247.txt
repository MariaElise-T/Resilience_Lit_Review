We investigated the impact of social support on learning burnout among 322 college students majoring in art education, and assessed the mediating role of resilience in this relationship. The results showed a significant negative correlation between social support and learning burnout.
 Furthermore, resilience played a mediating role in this relationship. Our findings contribute to understanding of the relationships between social support, learning burnout, and resilience in the context of Chinese higher education. The findings also provide practical insights for educators
 seeking to prevent student learning burnout, and suggest future research directions.
