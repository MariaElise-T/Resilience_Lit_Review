AbstractCentenarians worldwide are growing rapidly and thriving as they age. This growth reflects their desire to thrive beyond personal and societal obstacles, a hallmark sign of resilience. However, little research exists on centenarians’ perspectives about their lived experiences that reflect resilience. Therefore, the purpose of this secondary analysis was to capture the perspectives of Appalachian centenarians about (a) living through their childhood and early adulthood in an area known for poverty and isolation, and (b) exploring the resilient nature that emerged from their narratives. With a qualitative descriptive design, 21 community-dwelling Appalachian centenarians participated in face-to-face interviews. They resided in either their homes or assisted-living facilities. Transcripts were analysed with Neuendorf's method of content analysis. Within three themes, 11 sub-themes were identified: (a) working hard for the family, (b) loss of a loved one, (c) gender and race discrimination, (d) impact of isolation on health, (e) living a simple life, (f) using family/community support, (g) consuming and appreciating food from their farms, (h) spirituality, (i) generosity of spirit, (j) living a clean life, and (k) happy, good and loving life. Collectively, these themes and sub-themes reflected how the centenarians overcame and grew from challenges and adversities to become resilient. Consequently, these findings show that understanding resilience from centenarians’ perspectives can significantly contribute to the potential for longevity.
