BACKGROUND: Resilience can help adolescents to have positive adaptations in dealing with difficulties, stress, and trauma, as well as preventing mental disorders. School-based resilience improvement programs have been implemented internationally. However, there has been no specific review to examine the effectiveness of the application of resilience programs in adolescents.


AIM: This review aimed to analyze the effectiveness of school-based interventions to increase resilience in adolescents.


METHODS: Search articles using three electronic databases, namely CINAHL Ebsco, PubMed, and ProQuest. The keywords used are “resilience or resilient” AND “adolescents or teenagers or young adults” AND “school-based intervention or classroom-based intervention or teacher implemented.” There are 1206 research articles from 2014 to 2020, but only nine randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies match the inclusion criteria for analysis.


RESULTS: Findings show that five school-based intervention programs have a significant effect on adolescent resilience levels, namely: enhancing resiliency among students experiencing-stress-prosocial, mindfulness training with learning to BREATH (mindfulness-based programs stress reduction), resilience and coping intervention (RCI), and girls first resilience curriculum. The shortest program duration is RCI, 3 weeks, while the most extended time is Girls first for 5 months. The duration of the program had no significant effect on increasing resilience.

CONCLUSION: These findings encourage further research and development of school-based intervention programs to increase resilience in adolescents, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia.
