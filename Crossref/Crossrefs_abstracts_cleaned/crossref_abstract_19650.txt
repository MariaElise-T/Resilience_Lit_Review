Abstract
This research is based on the high intensity of fires in dense residential areas of Makassar City, which is caused by high vulnerability to fire and low community capacity and resilience. Barrang Lompo Island is an area with a fairly high population and density of buildings. So that the potential of fires is also likely to occur on Barrang Lompo. This study aimed to identify the level of community capacity and resilience using a community capital framework approach. The capacity stage analysis is carried out by converting qualitative data into a capacity assessment scale. Then, using expert opinion to assess the value of each variable using AHP method. Furthermore, classifying the level of Community capacity is classified using the scoring method. The results show that community capacity are classified as moderate to high, with a score of 1.89-2.31. In general, the capacity and resilience of fire, including individual capabilities, social capital, local culture, natural and physical capital, are moderate to high. Meanwhile, policy and financial aspects are quite low. In conclusion, to improve community resilience, it is recommended to improve individual preparedness through education, create a small island fire management policy, provide emergency transport and improve the local economy.
