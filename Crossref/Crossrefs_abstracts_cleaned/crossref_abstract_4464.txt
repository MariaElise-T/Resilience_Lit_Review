Banking institutions make an important contribution to improving economic conditions so that they remain conducive. This causes banks to play a role in the world of development and trade related to the provision of business capital or in fulfilling community needs. This study aims to describe the characteristics of bank resilience research data in various aspects/categories and determine the factors that influence the increase in bank resilience. The method used in this study is a systematic mapping study (SMS) to examine scientific publications produced from time to time, focus, locus, the most widely investigated types of research, as well as the most widely used research methods. The SMS procedure follows established empirical guidelines and the mapping data relies on Springer, SAGE, Emerald, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus electronic databases. Based on the results of SMS on research in the field of organizational change, it is known that 84 studies meet the inclusion criteria. We classify 84 articles in the topic area by category of type of paper, method, focus, locus, and year of research publication as well as factors that can affect bank resilience.
