This paper presents the final results achieved within the EFIPSANS project on the topic of resilience and survivability in autonomic networks. In particular, the outcome of the investigation of the following issues is presented: adaptive level of recovery, unified architecture for autonomic routing resilience, synergies between autonomic fault-management and resilience in self-managing networks, as well as network resilience through autonomic reroute mechanism enhanced with multi-path node-to-node cooperation. The described ideas are supported by exhaustive descriptions and analyses featuring extensive validation results aimed to prove the applicability of the proposed concepts.
