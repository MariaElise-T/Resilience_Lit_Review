Purpose
This study aims to propose a structural model drawing from the theoretical literature, extending the relative research fields to the competitive strategy. The empirical results involve data collection of 582 data that represents various enterprises in the Indonesian context. The authors develop four scenarios of strategic innovation based on the empirical findings, which extend the discussion on the concept of competitive strategy.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper aims to examine the impact of organisational resilience and marketing communication on competitive advantage through new product development under information technological turbulence.


Findings
The results indicate that product development is less effective to firm competitive advantage during the high information technological turbulence than during low information technological turbulence. This study shows that organisational resilience and marketing communication help firms achieve a competitive advantage. The authors also identify four scenarios for strategic innovation, drawing from empirical results.


Originality/value
This paper extends the literature of resource-based views by proposing a model that concerns product development as the primary determinant of competitive advantage. In addition, this study discusses the intersection between the concept of dynamic capability and contingency theory by examining how firms deal with information technological turbulence.
