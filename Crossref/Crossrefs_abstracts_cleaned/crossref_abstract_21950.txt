This study introduces the principle of resilience into the study of human settlements. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation model of urban human settlements’ resilience based on the provincial region of China was constructed using the Driver–Pressure–State–Impact–Response framework. The spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of urban human settlements’ resilience was explored. The influencing factors were analysed by geographical detectors, and the driving mechanism was constructed. Results show that the following. (1) The resilience level of human settlements in China continued to increase, and the resilience level of each province and city changed significantly. The overall clustering effect showed a tendency to fluctuate and weaken. The distribution of cold spot areas became less and less, and the hot spots were moving from northeast China to southeast China. (2) Significant differences existed in the intensity of the impact of different indicators on the resilience system. The value of the impact factor showed an overall upward trend, and the number of key impact factors increased. (3) Improving the ability of scientific and technological innovation, accelerating the transformation and upgrading of the regional economy, increasing the training of talents and making financial inclination in scientific and technological development and industrial pollution control were all important ways for developing and maintaining the resilience of urban human settlements. This study not only introduces a new evaluation of urban human settlements from the perspective of resilience but also explores key impact indices and driving mechanisms, which provides new ideas for studying urban human settlements.
