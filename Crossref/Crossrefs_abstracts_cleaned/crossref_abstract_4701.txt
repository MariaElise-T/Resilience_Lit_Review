Abstract
Background: The vulnerabilities and risks of women injecting drug users (WIDUs) are different compared to their male counterparts. In light of scant literature in this area, we carried out this qualitative study with the aim to explore the lived experiences of WIDUs in the North of Mauritius. Its objectives were (1) To get an insight into the risks taken during the injection practices of WIDUs and (2) To obtain an in-depth understanding of the gender-specific vulnerability of the sexual behaviours of WIDUs. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used for the research work. Study participants were recruited from a specific needle exchange site, by purposive sampling until saturation of data was reached. In-depth interviews conducted were transcribed for thematic analysis. Ethical clearance was obtained from the relevant authorities. Findings: The principal theme which emerged from the data collected was “Drug Injection Scenario”, with the following sub-themes: settings for drug injection; pre-injection rituals; third party assistance; sharing and recycling of injecting materials. The second theme which came out was “Sex Work and Drug Use Interplay” with either sex work preceding drug injection or drug injection preceding sex work. Finally, the third theme was “Sexual Behaviours Screenplay” with casual encounters and unprotected sex. Conclusions: This study filled the gap with respect to the absence of qualitative studies among WIDUs in Mauritius. It revealed their risky drug injecting practices and sexual behaviours. Their psychological and physical dependence on drug injection contributed to their stay within this vulnerable circle. Their inability to access adequate support hinders them from coming out of the clutches of their risky drug injection and sexual practices. For resilience of the society, there is need to address the needs of this vulnerable group of women.
