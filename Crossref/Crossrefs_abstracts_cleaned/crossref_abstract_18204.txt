AbstractThe topic of community resilience attracts as much academic research as it does social media. Understanding the drivers of change and community adaptation in the face of critical events is a key clue to governance actions and local measures. However, both academia and the media often provide partial definitions of community resilience. Beginning with an integration of theory-driven and data-driven knowledge, the study aims to uncover and operationalize the building blocks of community resilience potential within a measurement tool. An assessment study, conducted on 1278 participants from diverse communities statistically supported a broad, inclusive model: Community Resilience Potential is composed of four main constituents (social capital, community competence, structural-functional potential, socio-economic potential). The Confirmatory Composite Analysis formalized for Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling revealed its good psychometric properties and measurement invariance. Although the study has limitations, it provides researchers with a valuable, theoretically grounded, widely-applicable tool for the investigation of the community resilience potential.
