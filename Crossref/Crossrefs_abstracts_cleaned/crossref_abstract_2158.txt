Resilient mobility and logistics (RML) system is now an emerging concept in the transportation system worldwide. Developing a transportation system is now a global challenge to support the economic development of any country. RML system is now a must to satisfy the mobility needs of its people, and participate in the global economy. This paper is based on secondary data analysis. It investigates how Bangladesh can handle the challenges it is facing now in becoming a developed country by implementing a more resilient mobility and logistics system in the future. It shows the impact of the transport and storage sector on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and economic development of Bangladesh. Besides, it tries to find out the barriers and limitations of the activities implemented till now or accepted and might be implemented in the future. It presents the current scenario of the transportation system of Bangladesh and proposes ways forward to overcome some of these challenges and promote sustainable development in Bangladesh. Under this backdrop, the study also aims to provide some possible solutions which includes implementing smart mobility, zero-emission, smart transport, development of robust modelling for resilience and response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation system of Bangladesh.
