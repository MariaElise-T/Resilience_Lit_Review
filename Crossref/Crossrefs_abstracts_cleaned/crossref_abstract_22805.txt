While investigating psychosocial factors on resilience and post-traumatic growth draws attention, research on biological correlates is limited. We investigated the relationship between post-traumatic growth, resilience, post-traumatic stress, and potential biomarkers in female patients with breast cancer (n = 71) from the general surgery or oncology clinics. They completed the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Connor Davidson Psychological Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), PTSD Checklist for DSM-V, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Blood samples were collected for NPY, ALLO, DHEA-S, testosterone, cortisol, and hsCRP levels. The relationship between biochemical parameters and the scales was investigated in the whole patient group and in the subgroup of patients who perceived breast cancer as traumatic. When all the patients were evaluated, hsCRP and depression scores were significantly and positively correlated; and hsCRP, BRS score, and PTGI change in self-perception subscale score were significantly and negatively correlated. There was a significant positive correlation between the ALLO level and the psychological resilience (CD-RISC) score in the patient group who perceived breast cancer as traumatic. It was observed that psychological resilience and PTG were positively correlated, and that multiple biomarkers were associated with psychological resilience in female breast cancer patients. Especially findings regarding ALLO levels and psychological resilience could be a new target for future research.
