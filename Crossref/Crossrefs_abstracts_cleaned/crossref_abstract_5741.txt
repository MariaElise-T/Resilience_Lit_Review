This theoretical research specifically emphasizes personal resilience phenomenon. Childrenâ€™s social activity is something that draws its significance from themselves; they must have a well-developed sense of personality and a clear understanding of their own role (their personal responsibility) in their closest social environment.
A mentee (a child from an orphanage) needs to shape his/her own personal identification; as a person, he/she should be able to count on his/her own developed resources such as resilience, and internal personal position towards the choice of lifetime values.
The article is a reflection on an approach to understanding the meaning of the personal growth conditions including the ways of structuring the teaching process that provides for the personal growth; a detailed model of interactions between eight structural components of an educational system as a social demand (state component), a targeted resilience buildup (projection component), a mentee (a child) (organization component), an educator preparedness (knowledge component), scientific and teaching information (constructive component), educational means of communication (communicative component), a tool of assessment (assessment and reflective component), and a follow-up educational system (prognostic component).
