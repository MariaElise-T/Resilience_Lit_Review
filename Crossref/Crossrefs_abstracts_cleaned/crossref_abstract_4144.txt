In this paper, hyper-elastic constitutive models of rubber material have been summed up based on constitutive relation and the Mooney-Rivlin model has been pay more attention. Then through the tension experimental test, data of sealing material under axial experimental are obtained, and M-R model parameters C10 and C01 are fitted by ANSYS. After obtaining the material parameters, compression deformation behavior and the distribution of stress field and resilience behavior of the seal ring are simulated by using ANSYS/LS-DYNA software under different loading conditions.
