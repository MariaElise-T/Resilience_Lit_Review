AbstractThere is an urgent need for enhancing climate change resilience in rice production. Here, we report a reflective algal mulching‐based culture practice to attain a simple and low‐cost biological method for enhancement of climate change resilience. The dense mulching of Rhizoclonium sp. in field water highly reflected sunlight in the visible and infrared regions, thus significantly decreasing the root zone temperature, and significantly and simultaneously mitigated CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions through gas retention and removal in the field water layer, as well as reducing gas production. The algae could also enhance rice growth and soil fertility.
