The validity of the Italian version of the 28‐items Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) was examined. A sample of 472 senior high school students between 18 and 20 years of age were used for this purpose. Reliability and validity were investigated by means of Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. The results supported the construct validity of the five factors of the scale, which yielded acceptable psychometric properties. The findings conclude that the READ is a valid measure assessing relevant resilience factors, thereby serving as a valuable tool in resilience and risk‐factor research in adolescence.
