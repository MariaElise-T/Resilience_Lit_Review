Abstract
Rural and urban communities merge. Sedati’s districts are vulnerable due to a lack of infrastructure, dispersed populations, disaster management capacities, and subsistence. A city is resilient if its citizens can survive and recover from a disaster. These relationships allow for implementing programs that promote urban and rural resilience. How do urban spatial patterns affect resilience determinants? This research examines the typo-morphological urban layout of Sedati District to discover the periphery’s resilience and current situation. By using typo – morphological analysis and space syntax analysis researcher seeks the configuration of typology and morphology of the area. The results show that global connectivity and integration exist only in the center of Sedati District (HH3). Disconnecting two nodes won’t stop the network if there are multiple pathways. Sedati’s axial lines cease in space. Decreases road strength. Controlling expansion and using land efficiently, fostering urban and peri-urban agriculture, and making urban hubs inaccessible to nature are local solutions. Sedati lacks mixed-use clusters and pedestrian mobility. Urban livelihood, activity, and total life resilience reflect a ‘center-periphery’ spatial structure with expanding and declining gradients. Looping spatial syntactic configurations are needed for a robust urban fabric. Mixed-use land helps urban clusters’ peripheries.
