Objectives This study attempted to verify the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between adult men and womenâ€™s time perspective and post-traumatic growth.
Methods To this end, 450 adult men and women in their 20s and 50s who have experienced past trauma nationwide were analyzed.This study conducted frequency analysis, reliability analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis using sps 28.0, and hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to verify the mediating effect of resilience in the effect of time views on post-traumatic growth.
Results The past negative time perspective and the present fatalistic time perspective showed a negative correlation with recovery elasticity, no significant correlation with post-traumatic growth, and post-traumatic growth showed a static correlation with recovery elasticity. In addition, the higher the past positive time perspective, present hedonistic time perspective, and future time perspective, the higher the post-traumatic growth, and resilience partially mediated the relationship between past positive time perspective, present hedonistic time perspective, and future time perspective.
Conclusions These results suggest that time perspective are an important factor in predicting post-traumatic growth and that resilience can effectively increase the level of post-traumatic growth, and based on the relationship between these variables, it can be a basic data to help people suffering from negative changes after experiencing trauma.
