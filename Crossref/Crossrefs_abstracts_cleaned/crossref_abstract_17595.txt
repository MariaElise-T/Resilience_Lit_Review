The sense of connectedness with family and school is an element associated with the psychosocial development in adolescents, being a factor that can influence the way they respond against adversity and adjust to change. This study aimed to establish the predictive value of intrafamilial relationships and connectedness with school, teachers, and between students on resilience in Mexican high school adolescents. The sample consisted of 645 students (50.7% female), with an age range of 12 to 16 years old (M = 13.35, SD = 0.99), from a public high school of MÃ©xico. Participants answered the Intrafamilial Relations Assessment Scale, the subscales of social connectedness with school and students of the MDS3 School Climate Survey, and the revised Resilience Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents. The results indicated moderate positive associations between the study variables and resilience. The higher coefficients were found between intrafamilial relationships and resilience. In the predictive analysis, intrafamilial relationship, connectedness with school and between students, conserved its significance for predicting resilience, with family relationships maintaining the highest coefficient. Results suggest that the family environment is the main factor that shapes how adolescents cope with adversity. Limitations and practical implications are discussed. We conclude it is important to generate strategies that promote a higher adolescent connectedness with key environments for the development of protective factors such as resilience.
