A methodology that judges the performance and estimates the effects of metro-induced ground-borne vibration is presented for the mitigation measures of resilient tracks. Two criteria are proposed for the purpose of judgment and estimation, respectively. One is the force ratio obtained by comparing the forces transmitted to the track bed of the resilient track with those of a reference track. As the force ratio of the track bed does not vary with the excitation and environment conditions, it can be used for judging the performance of the ground-borne vibration, i.e. the inherent ability to mitigate vibration, of the resilient track. Another criterion is the overall frequency-weighted root-mean-square acceleration at the receivers. This criterion is used for the estimation of the real effects of the ground-borne vibration of a resilient track in practical conditions. Calculation results demonstrate that the practical effects of ground-borne vibration of the mitigation measures studied vary with the excitation and environment factors and tend to be more effective when the unevenness excitation is rougher or the monitoring points are closer to the source of vibration. The proposed criteria, the corresponding models developed, and the methodology presented exhibit both high efficiency in computation and great convenience for assessing the mitigation measures of resilient tracks.
