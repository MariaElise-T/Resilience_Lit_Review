This article examines the peculiarities of the information resilience of Ukraine and the EU, and their similarities and differences. Special attention is paid to the transformation of the information resilience of Ukraine before and during Russiaâ€™s aggression. Information resilience is considered in close connection with information security, with the correlations between them being revealed and the main constituent elements of these phenomena being determined. The authors analyse the communication aspects of information resilience, not taking into account the purely technological perspective of cyberspace protection but concentrating on measures aimed at blocking and disavowing the hostile information content that affects the cognitive stability of Ukrainian citizens.
