AbstractAimTo explore resilience and associated factors in spousal caregivers of patients with cancer.DesignAn integrative review.MethodsThis review used the standardized critical appraisal instruments developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and was conducted by researching the electronic databases of Cochrane, CINAHL, ProQuest, Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO and Google Scholar. The articles were published in English with full text from January 2010 to January 2020.ResultsAccording to data retrieval, 26 articles were finally selected. From this review, resilience was typically measured by using exact resilience scales (i.e. Connor‚ÄêDavidson or Wagnild Resilience Scales) or using other variables to indicate either more positive psychological outcomes or less negative psychological outcomes. For factors associated with resilience, these were classified as individual internal and external factors. Internal factors included caregiver burden, psychological distress, coping strategies and other factors, whereas social support, couple interaction, patient health status and other parameters were considered external factors.ConclusionsResilience plays an important role in promoting positive adaptation in spite of adversity among the spousal caregivers of patients with cancer. Due to the uniqueness of resilience among spousal caregivers, ways to assess resilience and identify its associated factors deserve more attention and careful consideration.
