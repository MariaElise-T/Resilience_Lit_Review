PurposeThis study aims to improve understanding of how coastal maritime transport system of Vancouver Island would be disrupted in disaster events, and the strategies could be used to address such risks. Any transport disruption at the maritime leg of the supply chain can affect the needs of vulnerable residents and thus, the supply of many goods to coastal communities.Design/methodology/approachThis case study focuses on the disruption that can be expected to occur for ferries that serves coastal communities of Vancouver Island in Canada. A landslide scenario in the Fraser River (which connects coastal communities) is developed, and interviews and focus groups are used to gain understanding of the vulnerability and resilience of shipping.FindingsThe findings show that the maritime leg of the supply chain for the coastal communities of Vancouver Island is resilient to a landslide disruption of ferries. Besides, there would be no impact on the operability of tugs and barges. This study also offers suggestions for creating the conditions for increasing resilience of maritime supply chains to any such disruption.Research limitations/implicationsA research gap exists with respect to minimizing disruption in maritime supply chains, mainly in regard to lessening the impact on the vulnerable residents of coastal communities. This study contributes to filling this gap in the literature.Practical implicationsThe findings have significant implications for maritime service providers and for people working on disaster preparedness, emergency response and recovery.Originality/valueStudies which focus on alleviating the impact of disruptions in the maritime supply chains and the mitigation strategies for coastal communities are scarce in the literature.
