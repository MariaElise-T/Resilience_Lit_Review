PurposeThe impact of COVID-19 pandemic has been severely felt by India's construction industry, which contributes heavily to economic growth and employment. An analysis of the impact of supply chain agility, supply chain resilience and information technology capability on the construction supply chain cost and delivery performance is presented in this study in an Indian scenario post-COVID-19.Design/methodology/approachAn analysis of moment structures-confirmatory factor analysis-based structural equation modeling is applied to a structured questionnaire received from 220 construction companies located in Southern India.FindingsAccording to the results, supply chain agility, supply chain resilience and information technology capability are essential capabilities for post-COVID-19 supply chain performance. Furthermore, these factors are observed to have a positive impact on improving cost and delivery performance in construction supply chains focused on building sustainability.Research limitations/implicationsThe results of this study can be used by other industries to ensure robustness and sustainability of business operations during post-COVID periods. Improving supply chain agility and information technology capabilities along with building resilience results in improving cost and delivery performance against disruptive scenarios.Originality/valueDespite previous studies addressing the effects of COVID-19 on supply chain performance, information technology capability, agility and resilience are not addressed in construction industry research. The current study examines the simultaneous effects of resilience, agility, and information technology capability on the cost and delivery performance of Indian construction projects.
