Abstract
Critical infrastructure resilience requires disintegrating traditional silos of stakeholders to form collaborative network such as a public-private partnership. Critical infrastructure resilience is mostly influenced by the relationship between public (government institutions/agencies) and private sector (private institutions/agencies). Public-private partnership is recognized as a medium to build the resilience of critical infrastructure. In this study, a scientometric review was conducted using VOSviewer and Gephi to identify the publication trend and gaps in the public-private partnership in critical infrastructure resilience research domain. A total of 87 publications were retrieved from a literature search on Scopus. It was identified that more studies have acknowledged the use of public-private partnership to build critical infrastructure resilience. However, majority of the public-private partnership in critical infrastructure resilience research papers were on cyber security. Some of the gaps identified included, limited studies on the responsibilities of the public sectors and private sectors in CIR, risks in using public-private partnership to build critical infrastructure resilience, the structure of PPP in CIR in different infrastructure sectors, and critical resilience strategies applicable to a public-private partnership in building critical infrastructure resilience. The outcome of this research will be beneficial to researchers where the gaps identified can be explored for further studies.
