In England about 5 million properties are at risk of flooding. Socio-economic growth, rising sea levels and extreme weather will exacerbate this issue in the next 100 years. Building coastal resilience is vital worldwide to save people from the impact of flooding and the costs of damage and insurance. In Australia the use of mussel reefs and mangrove forests combined with man-made structures are being trialed to see how well they protect shorelines. Ways to measure the evolving effectiveness of nature-based hazard management are now required to determine the cost-benefit over various management epochs. Using capacitance-wire technology we have developed innovative systems to measure the required field data: overtopping, wave, water level and inundation conditions at the land-sea interface.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9IpZpOPW3I&feature=youtu.be
