Temperature change can have profound impacts on livelihood activities and human well-being. Specific factors such as land transitions and climate knowledge can influence temperature variation and actions for adaptation. In addition to meteorological data, this study integrates land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery and local temperature perceptions obtained through interviews to advance a deeper understanding of spatial temperature and its impacts, which is not often seen within climate studies. This study examines local temperature across three different land types (rural mountains, rural agricultural lowlands, urban areas) in the Greater Angkor Region of Cambodia to highlight important insights about temperature and climate resilience action. The results revealed that changes in temperature were most pronounced in Phnom Kulen National Park (rural mountain) and in the rural agricultural lowlands, where residents discussed direct impacts and disruptions to their lives. Temperature, in both the LST results and through local perceptions, demonstrated a strong correlation to ground features, where areas with low vegetation exhibited high temperatures and areas with high vegetation observed low temperatures. While climate action in the form of tree planting and forest conservation are major climate mitigation strategies being undertaken in this region, social awareness and the ability to adapt to changes in temperature was revealed to be uneven across the landscape, suggesting that local entities should mobilize around gaining more education and training for all residents.
