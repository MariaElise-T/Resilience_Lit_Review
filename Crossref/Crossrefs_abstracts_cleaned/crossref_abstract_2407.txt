Sustainable and resilient supplier selection and management are essential to building environmentally responsible and resilient supply chains. Selecting sustainable and resilient suppliers enables organizations to ensure the long-term viability of the supply chain. To do that, there is a need to identify suitable suppliers that align with sustainability and resilience goals. This study aims to provide an overview of the requirements and criteria for selecting and managing sustainable and resilient suppliers and emphasizes the significance of integrating sustainability and resilience principles throughout the supply chain. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is used to deal with various criteria. The double normalization-based multi-aggregation (DNMA) method ranks the alternatives. This study used 18 criteria and 12 alternatives to select the best one. By employing these criteria, organizations can identify suppliers that align with sustainability and resilience goals.Â  The results show that alternative 3 is the best and alternative 11 is the worst. Also, the results show that the proposed method can provide a new method to rank alternatives. Moreover, the proposed method can introduce a more simple and flexible method for selecting a suitable supplier and ensuring the long-term viability of the supply chain.
