This paper investigates the relation between resilience and social problem solving among Indian adolescent boys and girls from a north Indian urban area. With the advent of information technology tools, multinational brands and privatisation of higher education in India, there has been a surge in the ambitions of the millennial Indian youth. This has also resulted in extreme competition, failure and non resilient outcomes for many. This study was conducted to find the level of correlation between resilience and social problem solving skills. The study revealed that adolescents high on resilience were significantly better on social problem solving skills, superior positive orientation towards problems in general and a rational approach towards solving them as well. Since resilience is a dynamic construct, problem solving training can be used to enhance resilience in adolescents facing mental health issues arising out of the typical urban Indian milieu.
