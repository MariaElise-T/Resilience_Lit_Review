 We examined whether obesity and metabolic syndrome underlie the development of cardiac dysfunction in circadian mutant ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that although ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice develop metabolic dysfunction, they are protected from cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular remodeling, and diastolic dysfunction, in contrast to wild-type controls, even when challenged with a chronic high-fat diet. These findings shed new light on the circadian regulation of oxidative stress pathways that can mediate resilience to cardiovascular disease.
