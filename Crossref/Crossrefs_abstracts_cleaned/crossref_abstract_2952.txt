Plant architecture develops post-embryonically and emerges from a dialogue between the developmental signals and environmental cues. Length and branching of the vegetative and reproductive tissues were the focus of improvement of plant performance from the early days of plant breeding. Current breeding priorities are changing, as we need to prioritize plant productivity under increasingly challenging environmental conditions. While it has been widely recognized that plant architecture changes in response to the environment, its contribution to plant productivity in the changing climate remains to be fully explored. This review will summarize prior discoveries of genetic control of plant architecture traits and their effect on plant performance under environmental stress. We review new tools in phenotyping that will guide future discoveries of genes contributing to plant architecture, its plasticity, and its contributions to stress resilience. Subsequently, we provide a perspective into how integrating the study of new species, modern phenotyping techniques, and modeling can lead to discovering new genetic targets underlying the plasticity of plant architecture and stress resilience. Altogether, this review provides a new perspective on the plasticity of plant architecture and how it can be harnessed for increased performance under environmental stress.
