This quantitative study determined the associations among the demographic variables, the extent of coping strategies, and the degree of resiliency of the informal caregivers. By using standardized instruments as well as profile sheets and checklists, 103 informal caregivers who are full-time provincial government employees provided data for this study. By using descriptive statistics, Pearson r, and eta correlation in analyzing the results, findings showed no significant relationship among the demographic variables and the extent of coping strategies and the degree of resiliency. However, relationships revealed between age and problem-focused coping strategy and between resiliency and emotion-focused coping strategy. Furthermore, resiliency could be attributed to both internal and external sources and associated with a coping strategy. It could also predict the extent of coping used by informal caregivers. Moreover, caregiving had both positive and negative effects on their health and well-being.
