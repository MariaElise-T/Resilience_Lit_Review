 The COVID-19 pandemic prompted worldwide policies ranging from social distancing to total lockdown. This study aims to assess mental distress and resilience as stress mediators during these two periods. The cross-sectional research followed 636 adults in Marchâ€“April 2020, from social-distancing restrictions through the transition to general lockdown. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Adult Resilience Measure (ARM-R). Higher DASS scores were associated with female gender, younger age, being single and childless, no graduate degree, being employed during the pandemic and lower socioeconomic status. After controlling for age, DASS scores were significantly higher during total lockdown vs. social distancing. Full mediation of the ARM-R measure was revealed in the association between DASS score and restriction stage (social distancing vs. lockdown). Tightening restrictive policies is associated with higher distress in the general population, with specific groups at risk. Intervention programs are necessary to increase resilience from an eco-contextual perspective.
