This article addresses a digital twin-based real-time analysis (DTRA) to meditate the power system vulnerability whenever cascading failures and blackouts occur for any reason, and thus, to improve the resiliency. In addition to this, a water-power package is proposed to enhance the vulnerable percentage of the system by promptly syringing energy to the grid under line/generator outage contingencies. To this end, in the first place, we will develop a digital twin model along with a cloud platform derived from the Amazon Cloud Service (ACS) into the Amazon Web in order to scrutinize the online vulnerability data arising from the equivalent physical twin in real-time. Indeed, such a DTRA model can help us check the real gridâ€™s behavior and determine how to meet the needs of the energy hub system to prevent blackouts. Additionally, a modified bat-based optimization algorithm is matched to settle the energy between the hub system and the electrical grid in furtherance of real-time analysis. To raise awareness, we will first compile how the hub system interactions can be effective in declining the vulnerability indices, and afterward, we will map out the ACS-based digital twin model on the studied case.
