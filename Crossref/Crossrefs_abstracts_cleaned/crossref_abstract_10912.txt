In the process of steady progress towards high-quality development, facing the complex changes in the internal and external environment, it is increasingly important to enhance the resilience of urban economy. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt as an example, this paper uses the panel data of regional integration in 108 prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2005 to 2020 to explore the impact of urban economic resilience. The results show that regional integration has a significant role in promoting the resilience of urban economy, and mainly by optimizing the industrial structure and improving the ability of innovation, and the role of regional integration on the promotion of urban economic resilience is heterogeneity in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.
