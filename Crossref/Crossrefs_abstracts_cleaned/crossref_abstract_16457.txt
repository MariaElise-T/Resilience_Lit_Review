This article, through a literature review, explores evidence that public governance positively influences and stimulates the innovation ecosystem, the co-creation, and co-production of resilience in communities that are victims of disasters, shocks, and even pandemic disasters, such as COVID-19. Disaster scenarios of all kinds cause millions of damage to society. The negative impacts of these contexts disasters, shocks, catastrophes, even if pandemic, such as COVID-19, can be greater or lesser, depending on the dysfunctions of governance and the negative barriers to the creation of public policies consistent with the capacity for resilience. Thus, the possible solution to this scenario may be based on public governance, if the pubic governance is instituted in an organized, integrated, and articulated manner. For this purpose, a theoretical conceptual framework of value creation is proposed through public governance that values and stimulates the innovation ecosystem, the co-creation, co-production of value, and a static, hierarchical, and linear structural vision. There is theoretical evidence that public governance can promote resilience in communities that are victims of disasters, shocks, pandemics or disturbances, through an ecosystem of innovation, co-creation and co-production of value. In this regard, at the end of this article, a theoretical-conceptual framework for creating public value is proposed.
