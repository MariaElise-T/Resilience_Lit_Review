AbstractMetabolites in plasma of healthy nursery pigs were quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance. Heritabilities of metabolite concentration were estimated along with their phenotypic and genetic correlations with performance, resilience, and carcass traits in growing pigs exposed to a natural polymicrobial disease challenge. Variance components were estimated by GBLUP. Heritability estimates were low to moderate (0.11 ± 0.08 to 0.19 ± 0.08) for 14 metabolites, moderate to high (0.22 ± 0.09 to 0.39 ± 0.08) for 17 metabolites, and highest for l-glutamic acid (0.41 ± 0.09) and hypoxanthine (0.42 ± 0.08). Phenotypic correlation estimates of plasma metabolites with performance and carcass traits were generally very low. Significant genetic correlation estimates with performance and carcass traits were found for several measures of growth and feed intake. Interestingly the plasma concentration of oxoglutarate was genetically negatively correlated with treatments received across the challenge nursery and finisher (− 0.49 ± 0.28; P < 0.05) and creatinine was positively correlated with mortality in the challenge nursery (0.85 ± 0.76; P < 0.05). These results suggest that some plasma metabolite phenotypes collected from healthy nursery pigs are moderately heritable and genetic correlations with measures of performance and resilience after disease challenge suggest they may be potential genetic indicators of disease resilience.
