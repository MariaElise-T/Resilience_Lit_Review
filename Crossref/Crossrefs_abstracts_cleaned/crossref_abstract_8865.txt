In this study, the methodology of cyber-resilience in small and medium-sized organizations (SMEs) is investigated, and a comprehensive solution utilizing prescriptive malware analysis, detection and response using open-source solutions is proposed for detecting new emerging threats. By leveraging open-source solutions and software, a system specifically designed for SMEs with up to 250 employees is developed, focusing on the detection of new threats. Through extensive testing and validation, as well as efficient algorithms and techniques for anomaly detection, safety, and security, the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing SMEs’ cyber-defense capabilities and bolstering their overall cyber-resilience is demonstrated. The findings highlight the practicality and scalability of utilizing open-source resources to address the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by SMEs. The proposed system combines advanced malware analysis techniques with real-time threat intelligence feeds to identify and analyze malicious activities within SME networks. By employing machine-learning algorithms and behavior-based analysis, the system can effectively detect and classify sophisticated malware strains, including those previously unseen. To evaluate the system’s effectiveness, extensive testing and validation were conducted using real-world datasets and scenarios. The results demonstrate significant improvements in malware detection rates, with the system successfully identifying emerging threats that traditional security measures often miss. The proposed system represents a practical and scalable solution using containerized applications that can be readily deployed by SMEs seeking to enhance their cyber-defense capabilities.
