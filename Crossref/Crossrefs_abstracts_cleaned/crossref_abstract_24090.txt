AbstractSocioeconomic disadvantage is extremely common among women with depressive symptoms presenting for women's health care. While social stressors related to socioeconomic disadvantage can contribute to depression, health care tends to focus on patients’ symptoms in isolation of context. Health care providers may be more effective by addressing issues related to socioeconomic disadvantage. It is imperative to identify common challenges related to socioeconomic disadvantage, as well as sources of resilience. In this qualitative study, we interviewed 20 women's health patients experiencing depressive symptoms and socioeconomic disadvantage about their views of their mental health, the impact of social stressors, and their resources and skills. A Consensual Qualitative Research approach was used to identify domains consisting of challenges and resiliencies. We applied the socioecological model when coding the data and identified cross‐cutting themes of chaos and distress, as well as resilience. These findings suggest the importance of incorporating context in the health care of women with depression and socioeconomic disadvantage.
