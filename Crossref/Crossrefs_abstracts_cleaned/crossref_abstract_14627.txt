PurposeFocused on the intersection between entrepreneurial resilience and different forms of collaboration, this research makes a systematic analysis of the literature resorting to various complementary bibliometric techniques (keyword co-occurrence; bibliographic coupling of documents; bibliographic coupling of authors; co-citation of references).Design/methodology/approachAccording to the research protocol defined, a search by topics was made in Web of Science (WoS), with no time restriction, which led to including 97 articles in the sample. Descriptive analysis identified the evolution and tendency of publications and citations, the most productive journals, universities and countries in this topic and the research methodologies followed in the articles of the sample.FindingsThe different bibliometric techniques applied led to understanding and systematization of the tendencies and themes concerning the topic, allowing the development of a conceptual framework articulating them and revealing possible lines of research that could contribute to developing the literature.Practical implicationsBy showing different facets of the intersection between entrepreneurial resilience and collaboration, this paper highlights the multiple implications of this area at different levels of analysis (individuals, ventures and communities) with the importance of networks of collaboration patent in each. Therefore, this study can help entrepreneurs, business and political decision-makers to make better informed decisions, which can be particularly relevant in scenarios of uncertainty and crisis, such as the present, arising from the global pandemic.Originality/valueAs far as the authors know, the research carried out is the first centred on systematic analysis of entrepreneurial resilience and forms of collaboration. It gives a complete conceptual and theoretical picture of the evolution of research on the topic and accordingly points out possible avenues for future research.
