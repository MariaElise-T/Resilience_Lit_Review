IntroductionMental well-being is a core component of mental health, and resilience is a key process of positive adaptive recovery following adversity. However, we lack an understanding of the neural mechanisms that contribute to individual variation in the trajectories of well-being and resilience relative to risk. Genetic and/or environmental factors may also modulate these mechanisms. The aim of the TWIN-10 Study is to characterise the trajectories of well-being and resilience over 12 years across four timepoints (baseline, 1 year, 10 years, 12 years) in 1669 Australian adult twins of European ancestry (to account for genetic stratification effects). To this end, we integrate data across genetics, environment, psychological self-report, neurocognitive performance and brain function measures of well-being and resilience.Methods and analysisTwins who took part in the baseline TWIN-E Study will be invited back to participate in the TWIN-10 Study, at 10-year and 12-year follow-up timepoints. Participants will complete an online battery of psychological self-reports, computerised behavioural assessments of neurocognitive functions and MRI testing of the brain structure and function during resting and task-evoked scans. These measures will be used as predictors of the risk versus resilience trajectory groups defined by their changing levels of well-being and illness symptoms over time as a function of trauma exposure. Structural equation models will be used to examine the association between the predictors and trajectory groups of resilience and risk over time. Univariate and multivariate twin modelling will be used to determine heritability of the measures, as well as the shared versus unique genetic and environmental contributions.Ethics and disseminationThis study involves human participants. This study was approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (HC180403) and the Scientific Management Panel of Neuroscience Research Australia Imaging (CX2019-05). Results will be disseminated through publications and presentations to the public and the academic community. Participants gave informed consent to participate in the study before taking part.
