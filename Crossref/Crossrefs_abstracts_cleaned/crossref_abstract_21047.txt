Identifying key factors affecting the resilience of a prefabricated building supply chain and exploring the effect mechanism of these factors can help to improve the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain. The main factors affecting the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain are sorted out first on the basis of Hall’s 3D theory and related research results. Then, the relationships between these factors and the dynamic change of influence of these factors on the resilience of the supply chain are studied through simulation by combining the fuzzy set theory, decision-making experimental analysis, and the system dynamics method. The results show that 10 s-level factors, such as disruption risk prediction and supply chain information sharing level, are active causal factors, while 9 s-level factors, such as disruption response time and disruption contingency plan, are passive result factors. Among the second-level factors, the disruption response time has the highest influence on the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain, and component design versatility has the lowest influence on the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain. The influence of the first-level factors, i.e., evolutionary ability, efficiency, and adaptability, descends in sequence. At last, specific suggestions for improving the resilience of the prefabricated building supply chain are put forward.
