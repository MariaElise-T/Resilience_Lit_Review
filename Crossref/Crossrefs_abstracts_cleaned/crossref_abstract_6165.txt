AbstractUnder high-risk conditions of genetic and family environmental origins, some children maintain a high level of adaptive behavior, whereas others develop serious problems. What distinguishes these children? Using measures systematically obtained in a 10-year longitudinal study, standard case studies were developed on 18 resilient children with healthy adaptation throughout development (psychiatric assessment) and on 26 troubled children with serious persistent problems. All children had family risks of affective illness in both parents and a highly chaotic and disturbed family life. Well children of well parents and well-functioning families were a comparison group. The children were preadolescent or adolescent at the time of most recent assessment. The ill and well families had similar demographic characteristics. Resilient and control children were very similar on most measures. Troubled children as a group had lower scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Childrenâ€“Revised, were more often shy, had poor academic achievement, and had a history of poor peer relationships. Resilient children elicited more positive reactions from teachers, were more likely to be the favored child in the family, and had more positive self-perceptions. Profiles of each child showed competing processes of vulnerability and coping. Children used a wide range of methods for coping with parental and family pathology. Resilience appeared variably robust or fragile depending on the combinations of risks and supportive factors present and the styles of coping with stress.
