The article provides a theoretical analysis and comparison of the category of “psychological resilience” with other, phenomenologically similar categories (emotional stability, stress resistance, tolerance, etc.). Psychological resilience is a more integral concept, the manifestations of which affect both the personal and social functioning of the subject. A review of scientific research by domestic and foreign authors was carried out. In the domestic psychological science, psychological resilience is considered as a personality trait, its integral characteristic. Foreign authors understand psychological stability as a combination of several properties. Special cases of manifestation of psychological resilience in personally significant situations are shown, especially in the context of psychological traumatization. When describing the emotional sphere and the characteristics of emotional response to personally significant situations, the aspect of resilience plays one of the key roles. Special attention is paid to attempts to develop structural models of psychological resilience and to describe its key components. The basic foundations of psychological resilience (personal qualities; the presence of a trusting relationship with one of the relatives and friends; the presence of social support) and its key characteristics (limit; reserve; variability) are considered. Separately, the ratio of psychological resilience and opposite personal and behavioral manifestations is shown – rigidity, inertia, imbalance, and conservatism.
