Based on the horizontaldisplacements and loads of column at top end deduced according to sectionalbalanceable conditions at yield of high-strength frame columns, the lateralmaximum loads of column at top end calculated according to the Chinese currentconcrete code and involved regressive formulas, the resilience model ofhigh-strength concrete frame columns were established. The main results show:the resilience models of high-strength concrete frame columns proposed in thispaper consider influenced multi-facts and conveniently applied to engineering.
