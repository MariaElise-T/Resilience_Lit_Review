 Personality type and resilient behaviors provide protection from the experience of depression, and resilience can increase the risk of not being depressed. Psychiatric–mental health nurses are well positioned to facilitate the development of resilience qualities in people who are depressed. Clinical strategies, which could be undertaken by the psychiatric–mental health nurse, include early intervention, promoting a positive social and familial climate, promoting self-esteem and support building, social and life skills/vocational education, and linking and brokering clients into extracurricular activities.
