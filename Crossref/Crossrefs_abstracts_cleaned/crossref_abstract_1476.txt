By combining the established development method according to VDI guideline 2206 and the new approach of resilience, resilient product development makes it possible to control uncertainty in the early development phases. Based on the uncertainty that can occur in a classical product development process, such as uncertainty due to (i) the transition from function to building structure, (ii) interaction of modules and (iii) planning uncertainty, we first discuss the limits of existing product development guidelines and introduce the concept of resilience. The basic idea is that a resilient process can control uncertainty through the four resilience functions (i) monitoring, (ii) responding, (iii) learning and (iv) anticipating. We apply this new approach to the product development of the actuators of the active airspring of the TU Darmstadt. The active air spring can be used to increase driving comfort in a vehicle or, for example, to minimize kinetosis during autonomous driving.
