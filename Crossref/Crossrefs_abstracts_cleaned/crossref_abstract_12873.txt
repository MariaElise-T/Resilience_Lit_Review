PurposeIn the digital economy, digital capability has become an important dynamic capability of enterprises and plays an essential role in enhancing firm resilience. This study aims to investigate the relationships among digital capability, knowledge search, coopetition behavior and firm resilience based on knowledge-based view and resource-based view.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses the hierarchical regression and bootstrapping methods to test the theoretical framework and research hypotheses. The survey data were collected from 241 Chinese enterprises.FindingsDigital capability has significantly positive effects on knowledge search and firm resilience. Knowledge search positively affects firm resilience and partially mediates the relationship between digital capability and firm resilience. Coopetition behavior weakens the relationship between digital capability and knowledge search, and the mediating effect of knowledge search in the relationship between digital capability and firm resilience. The moderating effect of coopetition behavior on the relationship between digital capability and firm resilience is insignificant.Originality/valueThis study clarifies the effect of digital capability on firm resilience and uncovers the “black box” from digital capability to firm resilience. In addition, this research enriches the literature on digital capability and firm resilience and expands the application of knowledge-based view and resource-based view in the digital context.
