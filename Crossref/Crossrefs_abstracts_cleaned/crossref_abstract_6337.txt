Introduction. Resilience has been proposed as a novel research topic in environments with vulnerable populations, since it promotes healthy development in the face of adverse circumstances. In the case of adolescents without parental care, foster care in social institutions has been one of the resources most used by the State to offer protection and guarantee the human rights of girls, boys and adolescents in Mexico, who may or may not present a disability and who lack a father, mother or guardian, for which by means of these institutions they guarantee the healthy development of minors. Objective. Analyze the levels of resilience in institutionalized adolescents without parental care, with and without disabilities. Method. Analytical transversal. The Asylum Anomie and Nominal Resilience Inventory (IAAR) was applied. 29 adolescents (men) with an age range of 12 to 19 years participated, 24 without disabilities (SD) and 5 with disabilities (CD). Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v.25 program. Results. 17 adolescents (58.6%) presented resilience, 12 (41.3%) did not present resilience according to the IAAR. Conclusions. In our study, more than half of institutionalized adolescents show resilience according to the IAAR.
