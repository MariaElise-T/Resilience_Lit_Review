This paper is concerned with resilient triggered control problem for load frequency control and virtual synchronous generation (LFC-VSG) scheme of discrete-time multi-area power system with parameter uncertainty, governor dead band (GDB), and low inertia under time delay and aperiodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. To reduce communication load of sleep intervals, event triggered mechanism (ETM) is introduced. A discrete-time switched delay system model is established to describe the dynamic of multi-area power system under resilient static output feedback control law. Combining piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) method with switched system theory, a criterion is derived that the tolerant bound of attack duration and attack frequency can be estimated explicitly. Meanwhile, some sufficient conditions are obtained which can preserve weighted     H ∞     performance. By using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques, a co-design method is proposed to solve the control gains and trigger parameters. A simulation example of a two-area power system was carried out to verify the efficiency of our proposed resilient event based LFC-VSG scheme.
