Building demolition waste (BDW) has been massively stockpiled due to increasingly rapid urbanization and modernization. The use of recycled BDW as unbound granular base/subbase materials is among the sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly pavement construction alternatives. The resilient modulus is an important mechanical property of BDW-derived aggregates and mechanistic design input of pavements incorporating BDW. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive laboratory study on the shear strength and resilient modulus characteristics of BDW-derived aggregate materials. A series of monotonic triaxial compression tests and repeated-load triaxial (RLT) tests were conducted with five different gradations representing particle breakage and different stress paths. The apparent cohesion and internal friction angle of recycled BDW aggregates under consolidated drained conditions ranged from 35.3 to 57.5 kPa and from 30.2° to 54.3°, respectively. The apparent cohesion and internal friction angle also increased and decreased non-linearly with the increasing relative content of fine particles, respectively. The resilient modulus of recycled BDW aggregates gradually decreased with increasing relative content of fine particles at the same stress level. Both the deviator stress and confining pressure exhibited significant influences on the resilient modulus, while the effect of confining pressure was more profound. Based on laboratory testing data, a mechanistic-empirical model was developed to predict the resilient modulus of recycled BDW aggregates from gradation and stress-state variables. The findings could be useful for extended engineering applications of BDW in unbound granular pavement base/subbase construction.
