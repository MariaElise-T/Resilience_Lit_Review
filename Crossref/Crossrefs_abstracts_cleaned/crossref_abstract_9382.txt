Since the financial crisis, there has been a second phase of global economic divergence. The context for global economic development has been worse due to the anti-globalization tendency and the predominance of trade protectionism. In the face of economic shocks, there are differentiated results for economic resilience among countries. Therefore, it is of great significance to study China's economic vitality against the background of the financial crisis. China's economy shows the negative adjustment effect of ownership structure. The relatively high proportion of state-owned enterprises weakens the promoting effect of economic complexity on regional economic resilience, and the weakening effect is more significant in inland areas. China's accelerated structural reform has increased the complexity of its economy. Therefore, this study focuses on the characteristics of economic resilience during the financial crisis, using China as an example. This paper uses the literature research method, the theoretical analysis method, and the case analysis method. In the context of the financial crisis, China's economic resilience has been fluctuating on an upward trend. But China still needs to adopt the economic measures it took to deal with the financial crisis.
