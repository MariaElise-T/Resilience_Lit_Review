This qualitative study explores and describes the resilience of homeless older persons in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Eleven participants, recruited purposively, participated in photovoice activities supplemented with semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed through reflexive thematic analysis and trustworthiness was ensured. Findings indicate that conflict, abuse, family disappointment, unemployment, mental health challenges, declining mobility, isolation and a lack of access to services are risk factors hindering resilience. Religion, support and socialisation, amongst other things, are identified as protective factors enabling resilience. Recommendations for resilience-informed biopsychosocial gerontological social services to homeless older persons are offered to navigate towards better-than-expected outcomes. Keywords: City of Tshwane, gerontological social services, homeless, late-life homelessness, older persons, photovoice, resilience
