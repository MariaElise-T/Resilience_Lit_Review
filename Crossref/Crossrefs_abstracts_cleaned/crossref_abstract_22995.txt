AbstractThe severity, intensity, and frequency of extreme storm events facing coastal areas are increasing due to climate change and urban sprawl. Migrant populations are particularly vulnerable in extreme storm events due to resource deficits, a lack of preparedness, and social isolation. Empirical knowledge is needed to help develop comprehensive guidelines to improve coastal resilience for the prevention of adverse impacts from extreme storm events, which should include specific action plans for migrant communities. A cross‐sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong in July 2018. Most of the 1,015 participants agreed that it was very likely that super typhoons would hit the city in the future. Although most of the migrants under study had lived in Hong Kong for more than 30 years and acquired the local spoken language, there were many significant differences between the migrants and native‐born populations surveyed, notably migrants' comparative lack of knowledge about the tropical cyclone warnings (odds ratio [OR] = 0.320, confidence interval, CI [0.227, 0.451]). Moreover, fewer migrants than native‐born populations had prepared first‐aid kits (OR = 0.583, CI [0.424, 0.801]) or flashlights (OR = 0.412, CI [0.260, 0.655]) at home. A longer migration duration did not change the risk perception or preparedness for a typhoon but did have a significant positive influence on knowledge. In addition, migration played a significant moderating role in enhancing the effect of risk perception on daily disaster preparedness. This research, addressing the needs of migrants in disaster risk reduction, suggests that future research and policy formulation should focus on strengthening migrants' preparedness for typhoons and enhancing their disaster risk literacy.
