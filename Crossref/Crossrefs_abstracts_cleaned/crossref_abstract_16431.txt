AbstractIntroductionThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between resilience and suicidal ideation, with coping strategies regarded as a mediator.MethodsA total of 422 Hong Kong undergraduate students were recruited with convenience sampling.ResultsSimple linear regression was used to verify the negative relationship between resilience and suicidal ideation (P < 0.001). The results revealed that two out of four tested mediation models were accepted, with the coping strategies of approach and reappraisal acting as mediators (P < 0.001); the other two models were rejected when the coping strategies of emotional regulation and avoidance were the mediators. Regression analysis was performed to explore the effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation in terms of the reappraisal coping strategy and the approach coping strategy, and the results indicated that the reappraisal coping strategy had greater effects than the approach coping strategy.DiscussionOverall, the results of this study confirmed previous findings in the literature that resilience can alleviate the degree of suicidal ideation. Additionally, these results suggest further implications that adopting the approach and reappraisal coping strategies might make significant contributions to reducing the number of suicidal cases in society.
