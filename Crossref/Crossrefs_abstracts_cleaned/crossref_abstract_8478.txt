This article is an endorsement of Wong's proposal that risk and resilience models provide a framework for research and practice with regard to the social and emotional functioning of children with learning disabilities. Future research should include an examination of the impact of family functioning and parenting, and peer victimization. We need to be cognizant of findings in developmental psychopathology that single risk factors seldom have a massive impact on development; children who are at risk typically experience chronic multiple risks. Consequently, we cannot explain the social and emotional functioning of children with learning disabilities without understanding the reciprocal interaction between children and their environments.
