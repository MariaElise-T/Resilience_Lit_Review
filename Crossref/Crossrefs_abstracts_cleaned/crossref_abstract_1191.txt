Subgrade resilient modulus of 3 typical soils, namely sand, silt and clay, have been measured under different conditions of 2 target dry density and 3 target water content by triaxial repeated-loading test. Analysis has been focused on the effect law of subgrade moisture and compaction for resilient modulus based on test results. Subgrade moisture has some impact on resilient modulus of test soils, especially on that of fine-grained soils. The influence degree of subgrde compaction depends on soil group. Coefficient of moisture modification has been introduced to characterize relationship between subgrade moisture and resilient modulus. Two-parameter Logistic model with inflexion control has been proposed according to the following basic rule. Coefficient of moisture modification usually increases or decreases along with the decrement or increment of subgrade moisture. And then variety rate of coefficient becomes small in state of high or low water content.
