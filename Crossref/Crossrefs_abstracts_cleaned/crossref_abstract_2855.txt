Being infected with the new Covid-19 disease in addition to physical risks, leads to difficult and different psychological experiences due to the nature and specific features of the disease. Successful patient management requires a comprehensive understanding of patients' experiences. This study was conducted to explain the experiences of patients with Covid- 19 using content analysis approach.

This is a qualitative study with a conventional content analysis approach. Purposeful sampling was performed in 10 Janu ary to 25 April 2021with the participation of 10 patients with Covid-19 referred to convalescent home No. 1 in Zahedan southeast of Iran. Semi-structured interview was used to collect data, which was analyzed according to the steps proposed by Graneheim and Lundman method.

Data analysis resulted in the formation of a main theme; “patient’s resilient efforts in the rampage of coronavirus”, as well as three categories and 7 subcategories. The main categories included; the basis for spread of coronavirus, breaking free from fears under the protection of spirituality, and mutual support between patient and family.

It seems that patients with Covid-19 were trying to resist the
coronavirus by resorting to spirituality and family support, so
the "patients' resilient efforts in the rampage of coronavirus"
was identified as the main theme of this study.
