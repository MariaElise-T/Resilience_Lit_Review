PurposeThis study was designed to assess the effects of epilepsy severity, family resilience, and social support on depression in primary caregivers of children with epilepsy (CWE), and to test the mediating roles of family resilience and social support in this relationship.MethodTwo hundred fifty-two caregivers of children with epilepsy were recruited from October 2020 to May 2021. The questionnaire contained sociodemographic characteristics, Epilepsy Severity, Chinese-Family Resilience Assessment Scale (C-FRAS), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Structural equation models were used to evaluate whether family resilience and social support as mediators between epilepsy severity and depression.ResultsIn this study, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among primary caregivers of CWE in China was 69.84%. Epilepsy severity was positively associated with depression. Family resilience and social support were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (both p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the fitness indices of structural models were satisfactory. The direct effect of epilepsy severity on depression was 0.266 (95% CI 0.064–0.458), this pathway explained 62.88% variance of depression. The indirect effect of family resilience and then social support was 0.069 (95% CI 0.025–0.176), indicating that the serial multiple mediation was significant. The serial mediation pathway explained 16.31% variance of depression.ConclusionsThe high incidence of depression among primary carers of CWE deserves more attention. They should be screened routinely, especially those parents of children with severe epilepsy. Family resilience and social support could be protective factors for caregivers' mental adjustment. Therefore, future psychosocial interventions for enhancing family resilience and social support should be implemented, in order to reduce their depression.
