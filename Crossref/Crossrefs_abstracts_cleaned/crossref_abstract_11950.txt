AbstractThe paper analyses practices and representations connected with the state borders by applying categories of resilience resources and the potentials of borderland communities. The analysis focus on three borderlands between Poland and Ukraine, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, located in the former Austrian Galicia, which are divided by different types of state borders. The analysis shows that significant similarities exist between two sides of the borderland independently from the duration of the border presence in the settlement structure. The main feature of the state border which differentiates the resilience capital is the duration of borderline existence. Local communities existing in the vicinity of the new border use their past to build their tradition over the border through informal co‐operation. In the case of the old and internal EU border, between Poland and Slovakia, such co‐operation is more formal and based on the external resources. The common feature of the studied borderlands is the use of cultural resilience capital instead of the cultural capital that these territories lack.
