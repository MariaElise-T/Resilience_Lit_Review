Abstract
A natural disaster is a phenomenon that causes loss and has an effect on society, specifically on vulnerable society. This research mentions vulnerable communities as women and children. In order to reduce disaster impact on vulnerable communities, it is essential to examine the preparedness level of the community. Slawi is one of the urban areas in Tegal Regency with a dense population and the potential for natural disasters. The objective is to embody a resilient community by increasing vulnerable communities’ preparedness in disaster mitigation. The method used is qualitative, and the main data collection technique is through Focus Group Discussion using participatory mapping analysis with the help of GIS. The result shows that vulnerable communities already know and understand their task and roles in disaster mitigation. Some crucial factors affect vulnerable communities’ preparedness levels in disaster mitigation. There are risk-understanding levels, knowledge of disaster mitigation precisely, and collaboration among local organizations. The urgency of government role and institution-related to provide guidance, training, and resources are needed to strengthen the vulnerable community preparedness. This research expects to provide stakeholders, regulation makers, practitioners, and academics with the knowledge to actualize a resilient community. With the increased preparedness level of vulnerable communities, the disaster impact on communities can be reduced, and they can be more resilient in dealing with natural disasters.
