This paper considers a discrete-time linear time invariant system in the presence of Gaussian disturbances/noises and sparse sensor attacks. First, we propose an optimal decentralized multi-sensor information fusion Kalman filter based on the observability decomposition when there is no sensor attack. The proposed decentralized Kalman filter deploys a bank of local observers who utilize their own single sensor information and generate the state estimate for the observable subspace. In the absence of an attack, the state estimate achieves the minimum variance, and the computational process does not suffer from the divergent error covariance matrix. Second, the decentralized Kalman filter method is applied in the presence of sparse sensor attacks as well as Gaussian disturbances/noises. Based on the redundant observability, an attack detection scheme by the Ï‡2 test and a resilient state estimation algorithm by the maximum likelihood decision rule among multiple hypotheses, are presented. The secure state estimation algorithm finally produces a state estimate that is most likely to have minimum variance with an unbiased mean. Simulation results on a motor controlled multiple torsion system are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
