In this paper, we describe the key concept for realizing “Resilient Society” which would enable sustainable development by enhancing the capacity of resistance and restoration of society against natural disaster. Going on three revolutions, the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the Information Technology Revolution - that have triggered significant paradigm shifts in the society, we survey the innovations having changed civilization from the viewpoints of energy and information, and consider the impacts of innovations in society from some examples. We point out that the key concept to realizing the Resilient Society resistant to natural disaster is “distributed autonomous cooperation.”
