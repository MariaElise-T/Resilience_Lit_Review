Based on a survey of 271 Chinese students, this study examined the mediation effects of self-resilience, communicative competence, self-efficacy in the relationship between the academic achievement goal orientation and university life adaptation through path analysis. The results are as follows: First, for mastery and performance-approach goal orientation, the paths affecting self-resilience, communicative competence, self-efficacy were statistically significant, but there was no statistical significance between performance-avoidance goal orientation and communicative competence. Second, all academic achievement goal orientations predicted self-resilience, and self-resilience predicted school adaptation, but the mediated effects of self-resilience were not statistically significant. Third, communicative competence has been identified as significant parameters in the relationship between mastery and performance-approach goal orientation and university life adaptation.
Finally, self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between achievement goal orientation and university life adaptation, regardless of the types of academic achievement goal orientation. Based on the results of this study, effective educational and counseling interventions were discussed to promote Chinese studentsâ€™ adaptation to college life.
