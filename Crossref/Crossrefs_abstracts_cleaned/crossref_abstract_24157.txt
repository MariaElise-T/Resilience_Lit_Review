Objectives  This study examines the structural relationship between self-leadership, social support, and resilience of college students in the Covid-19 situation and aims to verify the mediation effect of social support on the effect of self-leadership on resilience. Methods  For this study, online survey data collected from male and female college students at K University in Seoul were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and reliability verification were conducted to confirm the normality between the measured variables and the validity and reliability of the measurement tool. Correlation analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to confirm multicollinearity and to verify the validity of the structural equation model. Finally, bootstrapping and stepwise regression analysis were analyzed to test mediating effects. Results  First, self-leadership’s does not have a significant effect on resilience, whereas cognitive strategy does. Second, action strategy and cognitive strategy of college students has a significant effect on the perception of social support. Third, college students' perception of social support has a significant effect on resilience. Fourth, social support has a mediating effect on the effect of self-leadership’s action strategy on resilience. Fifth, social support has a mediating effect on the effect of self-leadership's cognitive strategy on resilience except instrumental support. Conclusions  The results of this study suggest that it is necessary to provide effective self-leadership programs and various forms of social support to enhance resilience by displaying self-leadership of college students who are having difficulties in school life in a pandemic situation.
