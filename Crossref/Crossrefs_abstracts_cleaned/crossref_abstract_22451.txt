Objective. This study aims to explore the mediation role of perceived stress between nonrestorative sleep (NRS) and emotional distress, as well as the moderation role of resilience among NRS, perceived stress, and emotional distress in university students. Method. We recruited 851 students from the Be Resilient to Nursing Career program (BRNC, registration number: NFYKDX002) in June 2022. Nonrestorative sleep scale (NRSS), 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), 10-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K10), and 10-item Connor–Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC-10) were administered through a paper questionnaire. Latent profile analysis and moderated mediation analysis were performed. Results. Three profiles of perceived stress were identified: high ability-low stress (24.5%), middle ability-high stress (65.0%), and low ability-middle stress (10.5%). The mediation role of perceived stress between NRS and emotional distress was significant (SE = 0.025; 95% confidence interval = −0.369, −0.269). The moderation role of resilience among NRS, perceived stress, and emotional distress was not significant. Conclusion. Heterogeneity exists in freshmen students’ perceived stress. Perceived stress plays a significant mediating role between NRS and emotional distress, while resilience cannot significantly moderate the associations among NRS, perceived stress, and emotional distress. The trial is registered with ChiCTR2000038693.
