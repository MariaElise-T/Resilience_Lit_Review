The academic period is a very significant aspect of an individual’s development. Although it is constantly observed that students fail to achieve their full potential. Procrastination or the act of delaying tasks might be a major reason in this aspect. The present study has focused upon the relationship between academic procrastination and resilience. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from difficulties and adapt to such situations. The Academic Procrastination Scale Short Form (APS - SF) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used in order to measure the procrastination and
resilience among students, respectively. The measures were administered among 80 undergraduate college students selected through convenient sampling method. The data was analysed with Spearman’s correlation method. The results show a significant negative correlation between academic procrastination and resilience. Hence it is inferred that if students can develop high resilience they may procrastinate much less in their academic activities. The limitations and suggestions for further studies are discussed.
