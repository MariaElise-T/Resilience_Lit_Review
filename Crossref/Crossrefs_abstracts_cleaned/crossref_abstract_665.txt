Infrastructure resilience ascribes into the United Nations’ agenda for sustainable development. The more information supporting infrastructure resilience enhancement, the higher chance that it will be done objectively and effectively, and especially in a sustainable way. In spite of many different approaches and data sources, there is a lack of information that respects the emergency service point of view. The main research objective is to investigate factors determining sustainable infrastructure resilience enhancement that reflects direct protection of the most important values (human life and health) by connecting multiple variants of infrastructural resilience corresponding with the voice of emergency service and based on real data risk assessment. The methodology consists in formulation of a reference model for informing sustainable infrastructure resilience enhancement, risk assessment for infrastructure safety in terms of emergency service perspective and risk-based rationalization of the enhancement manners. The model stems from urban resilience and city resilience. Its components are physical resilience, structure and setting resilience, organizational resilience, economic resilience and legal resilience. These elements are related to hazards’ character, operational specification and resource requirements, operationalizing the model in terms of emergency conditions. For risk rationalization purpose, 1,255,826 events which occurred in 2015–2019 are analysed. Nearly 70% of the summary value of infrastructural risk is related to residential buildings and other categories of objects (garages, auto repair shops, monuments of material culture, objects of natural environment, hydro-technical objects, military objects, ex-territorial objects and others). Sustainable-related manners are specified notably for abovementioned buildings and objects. Deepening the analysis of cognitive limitations gives ideas for further research.
