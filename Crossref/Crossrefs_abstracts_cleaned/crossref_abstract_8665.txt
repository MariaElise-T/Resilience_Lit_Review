The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the compassion and resilience of nurses working in a university hospital.  This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 168 nurses working in a university hospital located in the western Turkey between June-September 2019. 80.4% stated that their cultural belief and/or religious belief affected positively the attitude of being compassionate while providing care. In this study, it was determined that there was a negative and significant correlation between the compassion scale and resilience scale mean scores (r=-.237 p=.002). As the compassion scale scores of the nurses increased, their resilience score decreased.
