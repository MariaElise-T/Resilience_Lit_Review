Resilience is considered an effective concept for cancer patients, but nursing interventions for improving resilience have not been studied adequately yet. We aimed to explore the components and related factors of nursing interventions for promoting resilience among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy (NIPRPC). This cross-sectional study included 68 facilities from 396 cancer hospitals in Japan. Participants were 377 nurses who worked at the outpatient chemotherapy center or cancer ward. They completed self-administered questionnaires including the NIPRPC items and Resilience Scale for Nurses, etc. We conducted factor, correlational, and regression analysis. Based on the exploratory factor analysis, six-dimensional factor components: “Support for patients during the present situation and increasing their self-affirmation”, “Support for self-help”, “Support for utilizing the cancer medical team”, “Support for obtaining family cooperation”, “Support for maintaining regular lifestyle during chemotherapy”, and “Support for interacting with cancer patients and utilizing necessary information”. The strong related factors for all six factors were the resilience of the nurses and the number of collaborations with multiple occupations. Our findings will help nurses improve the psychosocial quality of life of cancer patients and address their needs related to cancer chemotherapy treatment.
