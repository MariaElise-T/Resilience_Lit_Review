ObjectivesWere violent/non-violent traumatic life events and victimization by/witnessing violence associates of attempted suicide among depressed adolescents who were also less resilient at early adulthood?MethodThe present study examined a subset of mainly depressed, age-and-gender matched, adolescents derived from a representative sample of 2464 students (T1, mean age = 13.7 years) followed-up after one year (T2Q) and reassessed 5 years later (T3, n = 252, mean age = 20.0 years, 73% participation), with a questionnaire, including the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and K-SADS-PL psychiatric interviews which also tapped traumatic life events.Results & ConclusionLogistic regression analyses revealed that attempters were victims, not witnesses of violence; more depressed and less resilient than non-attempters, and that resilience was a moderator of lifetime violent events and attempted suicide, even in the presence of antecedent depression.
