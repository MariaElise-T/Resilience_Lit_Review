With extreme rainfall events and rapid urbanization, urban flood disaster events are increasing dramatically. As a key flood control city in China, Changchun City suffers casualties and economic losses every year due to floods. The improvement of flood resilience has become an important means for cities to resist flood risks. Therefore, this paper constructs an assessment model of urban flood resilience from four aspects: infrastructure, environment, society and economy. Then, it quantifies infrastructure and environmental vulnerability based on GIS, and uses TOPSIS to quantify social and economic recoverability. Finally, based on k-means clustering of infrastructure and environmental vulnerability and social and economic recoverability, the flood resilience of Changchun City was evaluated. The results show that different factors have different effects on flood resilience, and cities with low infrastructure and environmental vulnerability and high socioeconomic recoverability are more resilient in the face of floods. In addition, cities in the same cluster have the same flood resilience characteristics. The proposed framework can be extended to other regions of China or different countries by simply modifying the indicator system according to different regions, providing experience for regional flood mitigation and improving flood resilience.
