Abstract
Smart and resilient cities are on the same path to long-term sustainability and need the creation of an ecosystem that can withstand an increasing number of hazards in the future. One of the primary goals of the smart city movement was to address many issues that have arisen as a result of growing urbanization, including the scarcity of energy, traffic congestion, and pollution. The way urban dwellers live, work, and travel due to more often natural disasters and political issues is changing, and this has an impact on the economy and business models, forming a new trend in urban studies. Smart cities play a critical role in the worldwide fight against Covid-19 in terms of tracking and tracing instances of coronavirus using smart technologies. The integration of smart buildings into a smart city also plays an important role in this scenario, providing advanced infrastructure and greater comfort for their residents as well as improved safety control, increased energy efficiency, accessibility to services, and overall satisfaction with a higher quality of life. The findings of this study are based on the review of papers selected from high-impact research journals, as well as an analysis of the most important industry tendencies and widely referenced literature on smart cities and resilient cities. As a result, this study examines the concepts of smart and resilient cities, as well as the relationship between smart city technologies, and resilient city indicators; the impact of technologies applicable in different smart city domains on city resilience is discussed. Finally, the conclusions on how proposed integration toward smart and resilient cities could be implemented for future citiesâ€™ development are presented.
