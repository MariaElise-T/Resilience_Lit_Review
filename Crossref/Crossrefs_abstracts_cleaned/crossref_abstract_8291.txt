 This paper proposes an approach for quantifying the demands on shear connections under the assumption of an ineffective column. Formulas and an algorithm are developed to evaluate the axial force, axial deformation, rotation, and moment demands on beam-to-column shear connections. The analysis algorithm developed is verified using a solved example found from literature. Parametric studies are conducted to determine important parameters in the connection modeling for resilience design. Furthermore, a detailed procedure indicating how to obtain the properties of an end-plate shear connection for its resilience design is provided. Four end-plate connection examples are employed to illustrate the proposed methodology. Finally, a capacity design concept is introduced for the ductility design of shear connections. This study demonstrates that shear connections should be designed explicitly for its resilience to resist progressive collapse of a girder-and-beam system.
