AbstractMental health nurses experience both organizational and practice‐related stressors in their work. Resilience is an interactive process of positive adaptation following stress and adversity. There is limited evidence on how personal resilience is applied to mental health nursing practice. The aim of this interpretive narrative study was to explore mental health nurses' stories of resilience in their practice for the purpose of gaining an understanding of resilience resources they draw on when dealing with challenging workplace situations. A storytelling approach was used in semistructured phone interviews with 12 mental health nurses who measured high on resilience (Workplace Resilience Inventory) and caring behaviours (Caring Behaviours Inventory). Within and across case narrative analysis produced stories of resilient practice within four themes: proactively managing the professional self; sustaining oneself through supportive relationships; engaging actively in practice, learning and self‐care; and seeking positive solutions and outcomes. Nurses displayed poise in stressful situations and grace under pressure in demanding and emotionally challenging interactions, holding dignity and respect for self and others, with the aim of achieving positive outcomes for both. Resilient practice is the responsibility of organizations as well as individuals. To develop practice and support staff retention, we recommend organizations use tailored professional development to cultivate a growth mindset in new and experienced staff, develop organizational strategies to build positive team cultures, and prioritize strategies to reduce workplace stressors and strengthen staff psychological safety and well‐being. The use of narrative techniques in reflective practice and clinical supervision may help build nurses' resilience and practice.
