The perception of interpersonal justice is one of the key resources for improving employees’ performance intention. Elements such as employees’ level of satisfaction or their self-perception of their ability to cope with problematic situations are key factors in this relationship according to the job demands-resources model. The objective of this study was to analyze how the perception of job satisfaction and the self-perception of resilience influence how interpersonal justice affects employee performance. A total of 315 public sector employees, who perform administrative and customer service tasks, have contributed to this study. The results show that the relationship between interpersonal justice and intra-role performance is completely mediated by job satisfaction; however, when we include the modulating effect of resilience between interpersonal justice and job satisfaction, the influence of the former is reduced as the self-perception of resilience. This indicates that the positive effects of justice are reduced as workers’ self-perception of resilience increases.
