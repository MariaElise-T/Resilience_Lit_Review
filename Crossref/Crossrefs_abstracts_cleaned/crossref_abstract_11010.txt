Objective: the objective of the study was to assess the relationship between fate control, hardiness, and wellbeing among the patients of myocardial infarction, with the mediating role of gratitude and resilience. Methodology: The cross-sectional research design was used to assess the relationship between the variables. The sample comprised of 150 cardiac patients included (male =111 and female =39), with the age range from 18 to 70 years. Informed consent was taken and confidentiality was ensured. The data was collected through valid and reliable indigenously translated instruments. Furthermore, data was analyzed through using SPSS-23 and AMOS-21. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 39 + 7.6 years. The results showed that fate control and hardiness were significantly correlated (p < .05) with wellbeing in cardiac patients. Furthermore, Path analysis through structure equational modeling revealed that resilience and gratitude mediated the association between fate control, hardiness, and wellbeing (Ï‡2 (1) = 3.01, p = .05, CFI = .96, GFI = .96). However, the wellbeing of the patients during the mediation was affected by the covariates such as age, gender, and hospital sector. Conclusion: The adaptive functions of fate control, and hardiness as a cognitive defensive mechanism and highlight the need to incorporate this cultural belief in developing culturally sensitive intervention programs to enhance resilience and wellbeing of the patients with myocardial infarction.
