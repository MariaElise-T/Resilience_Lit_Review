This paper aims to explore the antecedents of success in the context of entrepreneurs with specific disadvantages, namely those with physical challenges, and those with mental limitations, such as dyslexia and attention deficit‐hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). With a sample of 114 disadvantaged entrepreneurs located in Italy, the research explores the relationship between self‐efficacy and entrepreneurial success (both at the individual and business level) and the moderating role of individual resilience. Implementing OLS analysis, findings suggest that self‐efficacy and resilience improve individual success of entrepreneurs and that their joint effect is positive. Slightly differently, it has not been found a positive direct impact of resilience on business success, while the moderating effect is significant and positive. We compare the results with findings from a sample of non‐disadvantaged entrepreneurs (108) thus providing diverse implications, opening up a debate around the different antecedents (and relative effects) of entrepreneur success at individual and business level.
