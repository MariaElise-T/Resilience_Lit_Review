 This critique will further explore Dr Haaseâ€™s work on interventions to enhance resilience in adolescents with cancer, focusing on the clinical aspects of the Resilience Enhancement Adolescent Profile (REAP) intervention. To summarize, the REAP intervention is composed of (a) development of an individualized family and adolescent profile near the time of diagnosis; (b) standardized, multidisciplinary review of the profile with development of a care plan; and (c) a series of 6 sessions with the adolescent and the family if the adolescent desires. The first session includes presentation of the profile and care plan to the adolescent and the family. Subsequent sessions focus on specific protective factors.
