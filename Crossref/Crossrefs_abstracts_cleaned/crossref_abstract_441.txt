Following Hurricane Sandy, the coastline of the Delaware Bay sustained damage and needed restoration in many areas. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) received grants as a result of Hurricane Sandy to rehabilitate and improve the functionality, sustainability, and resiliency for several areas along the Delaware Bay shoreline. This paper is a coastal management case study of five of these areas.
