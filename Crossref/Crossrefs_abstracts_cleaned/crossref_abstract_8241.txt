Resilience refers to a person's psychological toughness, which is the ability to coordinate and adapt well in the face of adversity, and is mainly formed during adolescence. Also, it is significant for later adaptation and development in difficult or high-risk environments. In this paper, through document analysis and interviews, we found that the factors affecting the level of resilience of adolescents mainly include: individual negative adversity perceptions and behavioral responses; distant parent-child relationships, abusive behaviors and negative family events in the family; the quality of the school and community environment to be improved. To address this, the possible pathways of improvement are: to develop intervention plans for individuals and pay attention to adolescents' psychological health; to give full play to the supportive and protective functions of families and carry out parenting function services; to improve the quality of school and community environments and build good social support mechanisms to stimulate adolescents' endogenous motivation and promote healthy development.
