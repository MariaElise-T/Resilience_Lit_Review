AbstractFollowing the COVID‐19 pandemic, organisational resilience is key, especially for small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs), which must face crises and overcome the handicap of today's digital markets. We explore how corporate social responsibility (CSR), digital technologies (DTs) and corporate entrepreneurship synergistically enhance SMEs' organisational resilience, employing dynamic capabilities theory to reveal mechanisms underlying CSR, DTs and organisational resilience. We assess this synergy empirically by surveying 259 participants from Andalusia's business landscape. Theoretical and practical implications illuminate SMEs' strategic DT use to amplify CSR and resilience. Finally, we outline practical guidelines for policymakers, business leaders and entrepreneurs to foster sustainable innovative practices. Embracing CSR and entrepreneurship cultivates resilience, enabling enterprises to thrive amidst challenges and stay competitive. Our paper advances knowledge by combining CSR's and DTs' roles in developing resilience in entrepreneurship. Ultimately, recognising and harnessing CSR, DTs and entrepreneurship synergy empowers SMEs to forge resilient business environments for lasting success.
