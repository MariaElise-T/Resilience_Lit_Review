AbstractThe sustainable development goals are a call to action by all upper-middle-income countries and developing countries to promote development while protecting the planet. The United Nations defines sustainable "a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". The present work proposes a first mapping of the correspondences between the SDGs and the 6 Missions envisaged by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). In this paper, the data referred to Mission 2 (Green Revolution and Ecological Transition) will be analyzed at a provincial level in order to evaluate the territorial adequacy of the economic planning through multivariate statistical methodologies (Totally Fuzzy and Relative method and DBScan). Data analysis allows to develop an integrated approach for the evaluation of the government policies of the territory and for monitor the progress of the subsequent intervention policies of the Italian Government.
