The proposed architecture provides low-overhead error correction capabilities relying on the hardware implementation of the algorithm-based fault-tolerance method that is executed concurrently with matrix multiplication, providing efficient occupation of memory and power resources. The Resilient Adaptive Algebraic Architecture (RA

Finally, we present the results of fault injection campaigns in order to measure the architecture resilience to soft errors.
