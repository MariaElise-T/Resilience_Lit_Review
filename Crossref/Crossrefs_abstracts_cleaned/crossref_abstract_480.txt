Youth with diabetes frequently have limited access to traditional camps because of the need for accessible medical staff. With organized camping becoming more specialized with regard to meeting the needs of youth, there is an increased interest in developing and examining the efficacy of programs that serve individuals in specific illness groups, such as youth with type 1 diabetes. In a collaborative effort between a local university, a diabetes center of a local hospital, and the Lions Club, a diabetes camp was created to assist youth in the management of their diabetes. Data were collected over the 3-day family diabetes camp through three approaches: a pre- and post-program resiliency-based questionnaire, the 14-item Camper Learning Scale, and open-ended questions for parents of children with diabetes who were involved in camp. Wilcoxon t tests were used to analyze any differences between pre- and post-program scores on resiliency. The results indicated a positive increase of parents’ perceptions of their child’s resiliency (Z = –1.833, P = 0.67). Findings from the Camper Learner Scale indicated that 77.14% of campers felt they “learned a little” or “learned a lot” about crucial youth development outcomes (e.g., independence). Finally, direct content analysis of the qualitative measures indicated several themes among parent respondents, which were generalized into three categories: motivation, community, and challenges. Diabetes camps and family diabetes camps have a great opportunity to address some of the challenges young people face while living with the second most common chronic illness facing youth.
