AbstractThe displacement responses of rigid structures supported on resilient sliding isolation systems with various frictions to six different ground motions normalized to ground velocity levels from 1 to 25 in per sec are evaluated. Through the application of an equivalent damping procedure, the minimum required displacement capacities as dictated by the SEAONC draft code are also estimated. It is concluded that, even though the code displacement requirement is on the conservative side, the displacement capacity requirement is not excessive.
