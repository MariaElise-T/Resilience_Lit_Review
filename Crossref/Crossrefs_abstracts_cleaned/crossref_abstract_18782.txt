The “carbon peak and carbon neutral” emission target has set new requirements for the supply chain structure, exacerbated by the complexity and vulnerability of the agricultural sector and global supply chains after the COVID-19 outbreak. Under these circumstances, the resilience evaluation of the agricultural supply chain based on green transformation became an important subject. Based on this topic with outstanding problems, this paper evaluates the resilience level of the agricultural supply chain in northeast China with the goal of achieving the “double carbon” objective. By focusing on its resilience, we selected Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces as research subjects and collected the agricultural supply chain-related data from 2010 to 2019. Based on the relationship between supply chain nodes and the operation system, an evaluation model containing three levels was established. The entropy weight method and TOWA operator were used to carry out secondary weighting on the evaluation system and time levels containing 12 indicators, following the evaluation of the resilience level of the agricultural supply chain in three static and dynamic dimensions using the grey correlation method. The results show that the importance of the evaluation level of “internode resilience level” has always been a priority during the decade. Therefore, it is pointed out that the resilience construction and green transformation of the agricultural supply chain should be strengthened and implemented from the following three aspects: strengthening agricultural modernization, optimizing supply chain operation, and the implementation and promotion of effective policies.
