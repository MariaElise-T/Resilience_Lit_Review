In this paper we used the geomagnetic data, collected in real time on the intervals August- September and November-December, 2016, to emphasize possible relationships between the anomalous behavior of the normalized function Bzn and the both M5.7 and M5.6 earthquakes, generated at 72 km and, respectively 71 km depth, in the seismic active Vrancea zone on September 24 and December 28, 2016. Daily mean distributions of the Bzn and its standard deviation (SD) are obtained for the both time-intervals, in the ULF frequency range 0.001Hz - 0.0083Hz, by using the FFT band-pass filtering. We investigate the singularities of the pre-seismic anomalous signals related to the M5.7 and M5.6 earthquakes applying a statistical analysis based on a standardized random variable equation, and the results are presented as Bz* time series performed on the new time intervals 1-30 September and 1-31 December, 2016. Finally, two pre-seismic anomalous signals are observed: first one on September 21, with values greater than 5 SD, what means a lead time of 3 days before the onset of M5.7 earthquake; the second one, with values larger than 4 SD, which was identified on December 21 with 7 days prior to M5.6earhquake. In conclusion, as the work-station has specific programs for data processing, analyses and real time (daily) data display on the institute website, it may be used as an early warning system able to provide useful information for resilience improvement against the Vrancea intermediate depth seismicity.
