Abstract
Many assumptions assume mathematical tasks are difficult, resulting in many students who feel a phobia or anxiety, or at least avoid involvement in any effort that may be required. This also happens among the students who follow lectures, especially the Linear Program. Students feel difficulty and easily give up in solving math problems. This study aims to analyze studentsâ€™ mathematics resilience abilities on Linear Program material. The research method used one group pretest-posttest design. Population in this research is all student of semester 3 of Unswagati Cirebon Mathematics Education Study Program. The sample of research was taken by purposive sampling technique as many as 54 students who have been able to teach the Linear Program. Instruments in this study the final value of student learning outcomes that have followed the Linear Program material and mathematical resilience questionnaire. The result of the research shows that there is a difference in mathematics resilience ability between a high and medium-high group, and there is the influence of mathematics resilience on student learning result on Linear Program material.
