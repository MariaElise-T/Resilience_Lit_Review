The prevalence and harms of the sexual abuse of children and youth by family members and persons in positions of trust are staggering. When perpetrated by clergy there is also spiritual trauma and loss of belief in a loving God. Safeguarding minors and vulnerable persons requires policies and protocols and an understanding of deep systemic factors that foster harm. Vulnerability is a condition of the moral life. In the Incarnation Jesus Christ and takes on our human vulnerability. It is inherent in our embodied and embedded humanity, unique to our situation, and pathogenic in unjust structures. Responses to abuse must be rooted theologically and informed by trauma studies. These show the need to deal with tragedy fatigue and crises of faith. Protecting children and youth and promoting their moral agency and resilience are central to discipleship. Clergy sexual abuse calls for a theology of childhood following Jesus words and witness.
