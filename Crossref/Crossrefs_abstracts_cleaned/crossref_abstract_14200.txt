This study analyzed the change in consumption of theater movies and popular music concerts and the difference in resilience with an ordinal logit model using survey data. The resilience of off-line content consumption was found to be weak in those with low household income and income generation potential. Consumption of theater movies recovers faster with age, and consumption of popular music concerts recovers faster in the Gangwon and Honam areas compared to the metropolitan area. These results suggest that it is necessary to expand policy support, focusing on those who lack economic resources such as income and economic activity rather than age and region in order to increase the resilience of off-line content consumption and bridge the consumption gap. In addition, the difference between the analysis results between all respondents and the actual viewer sample shows that the gap in off-line content consumption among experienced users may be widening.
