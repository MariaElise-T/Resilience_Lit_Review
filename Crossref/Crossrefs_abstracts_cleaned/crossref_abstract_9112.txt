AbstractIn this paper, the role of infills in seismic resilience of reinforced concrete moment frames with special ductility is investigated. For this purpose, frames of 4, 8, and 12 stories are simulated in OpenSees software in three cases, namely, bare frame, frame with infills, and frame with infills having openings. Using incremental dynamic analysis, their capacity and demands are evaluated and fragility curves are plotted via statistical methods. Finally, resilience index is calculated by quantifying seismic damages under a selection of 15 earthquake records. Based on the results, infills decrease structural losses and increase resilience in different hazard levels. The effect of infills on resilience index grows in higher hazard levels and this is much more impressive in low rise frames. In the other hand, infill openings, less decrease the resilience index in tall buildings than shorter ones.
