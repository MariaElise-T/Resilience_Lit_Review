Background
Complementary and integrative health (CIH) is the foundation of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Whole Health System program (WH), including Transforming Health and Resiliency through Integration of Values-based Experiences (THRIVE). The global COVID-19 pandemic prompted an urgent need to provide services such as THRIVE while following guidelines for social distancing.


Objective
The objective of this paper was to describe the systematic implementation of THRIVE using an electronic delivery model.


Methods
The study involved an observational clinical program implementation project using the RE-AIM framework to contextualize the implementation strategies and results, and then the implementation of an electronically delivered CIH group medical appointment program (eTHRIVE).


Results
Clinical staff transitioned to 100% electronic delivery of the THRIVE curriculum using the new eTHRIVE delivery model. The current electronic delivery model, eTHRIVE, has effectively enrolled 10-12 veterans per cohort, with 8 cohorts, totaling 87 veterans to date. eTHRIVE attrition has been 6% (5/87) since initiation.


Conclusions
The current climate of the VA WH programmatic initiative combined with the public health needs during a global pandemic prompted the move of THRIVE program into an electronic format to broaden scalability and reach.
