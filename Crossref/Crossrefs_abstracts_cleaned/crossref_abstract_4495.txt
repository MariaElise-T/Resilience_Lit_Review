The healthcare resources supply network design for resilience is an effective way to deal with uncertainty disruption. In this article we propose a model of supply network self-organization evolution, and establish self-organized criticality as a cause of cascade failure. Our main purpose is to keep the system in a resilient range, i.e., critical state. A network structural design with smaller degree distribution exponent can achieve better absorptive capacity at macro level. An interactive rule design with extremal optimization has better adaptive capacity at micro level. Using macro statistic and indicator micro performance indicator, we demonstrate that our design can slow the development to a supercritical state and can improve the resilience of the supply network.
