AbstractThe research literature has found current Enterprise Architecture (EA) methods are limited in dealing with uncertainty and pathologies of complex systems to enable design and operation of a resilient enterprise. To some extent, EAs’ approaches persist in applying textbook plans and activities in the face of mounting evidence of changing circumstances and the challenges of uncertainty. They rely on a qualitative shift in assessment, priorities, or response strategy, that often lead to a ‘failure to adapt adequately.’ To address this gap in EA resilience representation, we have combined several prior research proposals to produce a wholistic Department of Defence Architecture Framework (DoDAF) resilience architecture and enhanced that with our original underpinning resilience framework. Despite still being in an ongoing major case study, our comprehensive resilience representation shows promise of assisting all enterprise stakeholders with adapting this representation to their capability systems. Doing so will better incorporate resilience considerations in capability systems’ design and likely help capability stakeholders to evolve capability systems with appropriate levels of resilience throughout their life cycle.
