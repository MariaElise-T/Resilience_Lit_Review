Immigration research has recently investigated positive adaptation outcomes such as psychological growth. This study tested actor and partner effects between fluid mindset and psychological growth, mediated by resilience, in 200 migrant mother–child dyads from Mainland China to Hong Kong. Mothers’ fluid mindset had significant actor and partner effects on their own and their children’s psychological growth, whereas children’s fluid mindset showed an actor effect. For mothers and children, fluid mindset had significant actor indirect effects on psychological growth via resilience. Mothers’ fluid mindset had a significant partner indirect effect on children’s psychological growth via children’s resilience. The findings have implications for enhancing immigrants’ psychological growth by strengthening fluid mindset and considering mothers and children as the intervention unit in resilience programs.
