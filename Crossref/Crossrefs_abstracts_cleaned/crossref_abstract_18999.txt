The present study aims to determine the relative contribution of psychological flow and resilience in anticipating the cognitive failure among elementary school students. The sample consisted of (114) male and female students aged between 13 and 15 years. The descriptive method was adopted. The study employed and designed the following tools: the psychological flow scale, the psychological resilience scale, and the cognitive failure scale. The psychometric properties of these tools were checked. The results showed that the level of psychological flow among the participants is high, the level of psychological resilience among the sample is high, and the level of cognitive failure among the participants is low. The results also concluded that the psychological flow is suitable for predicting cognitive failure, as the regression coefficient was −7.436, which is a statistically significant value at the level 0.001; and the psychological resilience can be used in predicting cognitive failure, as the regression coefficient was −5.824, and it is a statistically significant value at the level 0.001. The study has a number of recommendations: designing training programs to develop the psychological flow of learners at all learning stages, holding seminars and workshops aimed at educating learners about the importance of psychological resilience for their enjoyment of normal mental health, and raising the awareness among the officials at the Ministry of Education about the need to train students on cognitive strategies that help reduce the level of cognitive failure.
