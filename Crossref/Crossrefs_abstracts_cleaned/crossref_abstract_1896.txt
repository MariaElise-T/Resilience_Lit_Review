 Objectives. To assess how personal social network characteristics moderated mental health declines during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults compared with other age groups.  Methods. The Person to Person Health Interview Study, a representative, probability-based cohort study (n = 2485) collected data through face-to-face (baseline) and phone (follow-up) interviews before and during the pandemic. We used survey-weighted growth curve models to examine network effects on computer-adaptive testing measures of depression and anxiety severity.  Results. Respondents reported significantly increased depression and anxiety in 2021, which returned almost to baseline levels for most age groups by 2022 (P < .001). Stronger ties to others and more interconnected ties were significantly associated with lower depression (B = −0.112 [P < .05]; B = −0.086 [P < .001]) and anxiety (B = −0.101 [P < .05]; B = −0.063 [P < .01]) severity across the pandemic. Interaction models revealed disproportionate protective effects of network characteristics on depression (B = −0.456 [P < .001]; B = −0.268 [P < .001]) and anxiety (B = −0.388 [P < .001]; B = −0.284 [P < .001]) for emerging adults.  Conclusions. Cohesive and affectively strong personal networks promote resiliency to common mental health challenges during periods of crisis, particularly for emerging adults whose social roles and relationships were disrupted during a critical period of development.
