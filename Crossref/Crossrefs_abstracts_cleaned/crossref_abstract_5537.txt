BackgroundThe aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between the level of resilience and the perceived social support, primarily emotional and instrumental varieties, among mothers of children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).Participants and procedureThe study involved 143 individuals aged 26-51 years (M = 38.41, SD = 5.02), mothers of children with ASD. The Berlin Social Support Scales and the Resilience Scale were used as data collection tools.ResultsThere were statistically significant positive correlations between the perceived emotional and instrumental support and all the dimensions of psychological resilience.ConclusionsThe results are consistent with other results presented in a similar area, but the specific context of this study should be considered â€“ in Poland, the medical model of disability still plays a dominant role, which means that little consideration is given to the needs and problems of families raising a child with disabilities.
