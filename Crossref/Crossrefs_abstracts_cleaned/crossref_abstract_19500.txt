Purpose
This study aims to explore the effect of value co-creation among health-care professionals and in a business-to-business (B2B) context on the involved individuals and the organization. More precisely, the effect of co-creation behaviors on the well-being of individuals, their work performance and team resilience are investigated.


Design/methodology/approach
A quantitative research design was adopted. The data collection was performed through a mail survey of a sample of 96 professionals at a cancer health-care institution in France in which several medical and paramedical providers work together to maximize service options. Linear regressions were conducted using SPSS to analyze the data.


Findings
The results highlight the positive outcomes of an active co-creation process on individual well-being, work performance and team resilience and emphasize its limits.


Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in studying co-creation in the context of the health-care service sector, among health-care professionals and from a B2B perspective. Adopting an inter-organizational frame, this study clarifies the positive and negative effects of co-creation from both personal and organizational aspects.
