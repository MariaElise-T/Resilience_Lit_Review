Future educators will face various challenges in their careers that will
   require a resilient response, and the covid-19 epidemic is just one of many.
   In this regard, we wanted to find out how students, future educators, assess
   their own resilient protective factors, how those relate to each other and
   which of them play a central role. The in-person survey involved 249
   students who completed an anonymous questionnaire by self-assessing twelve
   protective factors of resilience. We used the Pearson correlation
   coefficient to determine the correlation between resilient factors and
   establish a network of interconnectedness between them. The results revealed
   that solution-focused behaviour (which is related to ability to identify
   challenges) has a central role in students? resilience. We assumed that one
   protective factor could contribute to the creation of new protective factors
   (e. g. focused on identifying challenges correlates with focus on finding
   solutions to them by using creative approaches, experiencing competence and
   success and orientation towards lifelong learning). However, this assumption
   should be further explored.
