Resilience is the ability to recover or cope with adverse situations. Spiritual and religious beliefs may be associated with important “resilience resources.” To investigate whether there is a relationship between spirituality/religiosity (S/R) and resilience. This is a systematic review (observational studies) with meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. From a total of 2468 articles, 34 observational studies were included. We identified a moderate positive correlation between S/R and resilience ( r = 0.40 (95% CI, 0.32–0.48], p < 0.01). When only high-quality articles were included, the results were maintained. Conclusion: A moderate positive correlation was found between S/R and resilience.
