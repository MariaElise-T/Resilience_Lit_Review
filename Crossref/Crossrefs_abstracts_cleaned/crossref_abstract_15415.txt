Economic resilience is a balance between economic growth and risk, and an important guarantee for sustainable economic development. The more resilient an economy is, the more likely it is to recover as soon as possible and change its growth path in a timely manner after encountering external disturbances and shocks, so as to achieve high-quality economic transformation and development. The agglomeration of industries in a certain space can effectively reduce the production cost of enterprises. Deepening the industrial division of labor and the extension of the value chain; High-end production factors are promoted to concentrate in this region, and the knowledge spillover effect formed by the agglomeration can improve the level of innovation, which is conducive to the adjustment of industrial structure and the enhancement of regional innovation ability, so as to improve the resilience level of regional economy. In view of this, the panel data of prefecture-level cities of Yangtze River Delta city cluster and Central Yunnan City cluster in China from 2005 to 2020 are selected in this study to deeply explore the influence mechanism of industrial collaborative agglomeration on the economic resilience of city clusters. The results show that the level of industrial cooperation can improve the level of economic resilience of urban agglomerations.
