In this study, the relationship between the mobbing experienced by the teachers in the Dulkadiroğlu district of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, and their psychological resilience was investigated. The sample of this study was formed by a randomly selected group of 290 teachers. Psychological Mobbing Scale (Ocak, 2008) and Psychological Resilience Scale (Işık, 2016) were used in the study, and the data obtained were analyzed using correlation and regression techniques. Findings of the study revealed that there is a negative and significant relationship between the mobbing that teachers are exposed to and their psychological resilience. In addition, it was also found that the mobbing experienced by the teachers is a significant predictor of their psychological resilience.
