AbstractThe emerging adulthood represents a vulnerable and critical turning point for the beginning of mental illnesses and is therefore of particular interest for the study of risk and resilience. The present survey investigated the impact of sex on the associations between resilience and the perception of social support and stress in students. The Resilience Scale was used to assess resilience. Stress perception and social support perception were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale and the Social Support Questionnaire FSozU k-22, respectively. Between the ages of 18 and 30, 503 subjects (59.6% female) were included into the study. We detected a significant effect of sex with markedly lower resilience and a more pronounced perception of stress and social support among females. Significant correlations between resilience, stress perception, and social support perception were found in both sexes with women showing a stronger interrelationship between stress perception and both resilience and social support perception. Mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between the perception of social support and stress was fully mediated by resilience among men and partly mediated by resilience among women. Of note, the mediation of resilience on the interrelationship between the perception of social support and stress was much stronger in women than in men. These findings suggest that sex-specific, customized interventions focusing on the strengthening of resilience and the claiming of social support are needed to promote mental health in emerging adults.
