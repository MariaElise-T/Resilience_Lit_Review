AbstractResilience is the process of coping with and overcoming adversity, finding purpose in the face of suffering, and preparing for the future with a focus on interconnections and personal strengths. Being resilient is the ability to flourish in the face of trauma or hardship. The traits and processes of resilience are woven throughout the film Little Miss Sunshine. As characters deal with suffering, they also embody systemic strengths, which align with the current resilience research. This paper explores the use of cinematherapy to illustrate concepts of resilience in systemic therapy and in training relational therapists.
