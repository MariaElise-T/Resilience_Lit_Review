Abstract
In 2018, Palu City was affected by massive disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, and liquefaction) which paralyzed various activities and resulted in losses of around Rp. 7.6 trillion. The government compiled a disaster-prone zone map (ZRB) that showed 96.03% of Palu City was classified as disaster-prone. It does not only impact the community’s perception of disaster risk, but also on settlement preferences (moving, hesitant to move, and not moving). This condition will affect the community resilience level against disasters. This study aims to determine the correlation between settlement preferences and community resilience, and determine the level of post-disaster community resilience in each sub-district of Palu City. This study’s analysis was done by using SEM-PLS. The variables used are social, economic, environmental, infrastructure, culture, government, and settlement preferences. The results show that all variables have significant impacts. The highest correlation came from the settlement preferences. High community resilience is found in Mantikulore and East Palu sub-districts, moderate community resilience is found in South Palu and West Palu sub-districts, while low community resilience is found in Tawaeli, North Palu, Ulujadi, and Tatanga sub-districts. The results of this study can be used as recommendation for the government to increase community resilience in Palu City.
