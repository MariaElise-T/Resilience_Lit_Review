AbstractBuilding resilient cities has become a hot topic in urban planning and risk management. Adopting the perspective of the social‐ecological system (SES), this paper incorporated economy–ecology–society–infrastructure into an integrated research framework and established a system for assessing the urban resilience development level. The entropy weight method was combined with a cloud model to systematically calculate and classify the resilience of 31 provinces (cities) in China. The evaluation results show that (1) the overall level of urban resilience in China was relatively low; the regional analysis showed that (2) the urban resilience of the eastern region was higher than the national average and that of the central and western regions, and from the perspective of the four subsystems, (3) the comprehensive development of each subsystem was the key to improving urban resilience. Finally, five improvement strategies were proposed to provide ideas for enhancing urban SES ability.
