This study intends to assess the level of religiosity and resilience of the first- and final-year medical students as well as the link between religiosity and resilience. In this study, it is hypothesized that religiosity and resilience differ between first-year and final-year medical students and that there is a positive relationship regarding both variables among first-year and final-year medical students. This study used the IIUM Religiosity Scale (IIUMRelS) created by Diana Mahudin, Noraini Noor, and Mariam Adawiah Dzulkifli (Mahudin et al., 2016) and the Resilience Scale developed by Bochaver et al, (2021) based on the idea from Connor and Davidson (2003). 195 medical students from South Sulawesi universities who met the requirements of being Muslim and aged between 18 and 25 were included in the study. Between first- and final-year students, the two research variables showed no statistically significant differences. Additionally, this research discovered a strong link between religiosity and resilience in first- and final-year medical students. According to the studyâ€™s findings, religiosity positively correlated with resilience in both first- and final-year students of the medical study program, where it contributed to resilience by 24.8% for first-year students and 19.4% for final-year students.
