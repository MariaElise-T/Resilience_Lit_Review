 This paper addresses the problem of resilient adaptive event-triggered control (AETC) for networked stochastic control systems (NSCSs) in the presence of the external disturbance and the energy-constrained, nonperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A novel adaptive event-triggered scheme (AETS) that considers the effect of the energy-constrained, nonperiodic DoS attacks on the communication network is proposed to reduce the usage of system resources and adapt the variation of the plant state, and the model of closed-loop control system is established in the framework of time-delay systems and switched systems. Then, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability criterion and the co-design algorithm are derived, which are used to ensure that the closed-loop control system is stochastically exponentially stable (SES) with an [Formula: see text] disturbance attenuation performance and to implement the co-design of state-feedback controller and proposed AETS, respectively. Unlike the network-based [Formula: see text] control approach for NSCSs in the existing literature, the resilient adaptive event-triggered network-based [Formula: see text] control approach proposed in this paper not only can considerably save the usage of system resources, but also can be resilient towards the energy-constrained, nonperiodic DoS attacks. Finally, a resilient AETC for the F16 aircraft system shows the effectiveness and superiority of proposed strategy.
