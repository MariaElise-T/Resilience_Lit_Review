<p style="text-align: justify;">The article is devoted to the review of national and foreign studies in professional resilience. The analyzed researches demonstrate that it is typical for foreign psychological science to consider professional resilience as a set of resources that allows a specialist in a difficult situation to provide himself with psychological well-being, which requires the skills of taking care of himself and his psychological state, providing self-help and the ability to adapt to changing conditions. The data of foreign empirical studies of professional resilience of specialists in helping professions have shown a correlation between professional resilience and emotional burnout, psychological well-being, self-compassion, and creative thinking. Also, researchers note the need for the formation of professional resilience in the educational process and labor activity.
