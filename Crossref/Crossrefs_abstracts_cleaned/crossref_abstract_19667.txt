Dispossession from social and ecological support systems is a major concern for        many Indigenous communities. In response to community health challenges in these settings a        number of initiatives such as youth mentorship programs have shown some value in enhancing        adaptive capacity. The pilot Going Off, Growing Strong program provides        opportunities for at-risk youth to engage in community- and land-based activities and build        relationships with positive adult role models in Nain, Nunatsiavut (Labrador, Canada). This        paper offers an interpretive description drawing from autobiographical accounts of the        development of this innovative program. A collaboratively developed conceptual framework,        based on the literature, is used to present and explain program operatorâ€™s experiences and        rationale for program development. The emergent goals of Going Off, Growing Strong        are to strengthen individual youth and collective community resilience through        intergenerational exchange of land, social, and cultural skills and knowledge by drawing on        social supports, such as a community freezer and experienced harvesters. We found that the        process of collaborating over time with multiple stakeholders in creating this conceptual        framework was an important one for solidifying the goals of Going Off, Growing        Strong and creating context-specific, meaningful evaluation outcomes to enable future        measurement of impacts on the community.
