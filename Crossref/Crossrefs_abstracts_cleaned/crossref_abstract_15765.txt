 This study investigates the impact of mindful and empathetic leadership on resilience and turnover intention, with self-regulation as a mediating variable. A quantitative survey was administered to 188 nurses dealing with COVID-19â€™s patients in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using Process v3.5 Andrew F. Hayes in SPSS. This study revealed that mindful leadership reduces turnover intention, and empathetic leadership increases resilience, while mindful leadership does not increase resilience, and empathetic leadership does not lessen turnover intention. We also conclude that self-regulation mediates the relationship between mindful leadership/empathetic leadership and turnover intention/resilience. Despite being limited to the Indonesian context, this research offers several contributions from both theoretical and practical perspectives. First, this research established the importance of mindful and empathetic leadership to promote resilience and reduce the turnover intention of nurses in the time of crisis. Second, we confirmed self-regulation as the mediating variable for those relationships. Practically, we suggest that having empathetic and mindful leaders is effective in supporting nurses to deal with COVID-19 patients.
