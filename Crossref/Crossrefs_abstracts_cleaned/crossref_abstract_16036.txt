Supply chain sustainability (SCS) has gone beyond the sustainability-performance approach, towards the increasing adoption of the sustainability-practice approach. The use of digital technologies in this approach can enhance resilience and human rights, particularly in the context of the green and digital twin transition post-COVID-19 pandemic. To enrich the sustainability-practice approach, this paper aims to produce a roadmapping taxonomy, based on knowledge mapping of a dataset collected in late December 2022 from the Web of Science Core Collection. As the knowledge map reveals the dimensions of resilience, human rights, and digital technologies, the proposed taxonomy highlights the importance of dynamic capabilities in facing supply chain disruptions, especially their ripple effects, along with the corresponding digital technologies to enhance human social dynamics in facing such disruptions. The proposed taxonomy provides a knowledge-based framework for professionals and researchers to enhance their understanding of supply chain resilience in designing and implementing digital solutions. The proposed roadmapping taxonomy features a people- and community-centric perspective and several managerial insights, contributing to the wider discussions on the green and digital transformation of the supply chain, by shaping actions and interactions in networked, digitized, and datafied forms to enhance supply chain sustainability.
