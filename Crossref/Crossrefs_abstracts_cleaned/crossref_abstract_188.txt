 This study presents a cross-cultural validation of the recently developed Resiliency Scale for Young Adults (RSYA) with a sample of 289 Canadian university students and 259 Italian university students. The RSYA demonstrated good internal consistency across the two samples and acceptable retest reliability for the Canadian sample. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor, 10-facet structure of the RSYA, and comparison of the two country samples found metric invariance. As expected, positive correlations also emerged between resiliency and trait emotional intelligence in both samples. Finally, correlations with personality variables were explored in both samples. The present findings provide further support for the RSYA as a valid and reliable measure of personal resiliency for both Canadian and Italian young adults, and for the cross-cultural generalizability of the three-factor model of personal resiliency upon which it is based.
