AbstractThe changing climate poses significant threats to agriculture and the ability to ensure sufficient global food production. With the expanding population, there is an urgent demand to increase crop productivity to meet the rising food demand. Producing climate‐smart crop varieties together with developing new agronomic management strategies are strategies that may help address this issue. Recent advances in genomics‐assistant breeding, the use of high‐throughput DNA sequencing, high‐resolution phenotyping, and advanced genome engineering can support the development of advanced, climate resilient crops. Here, we assess the potential to enhance the resilience of crops under the changing climate. Through the use of big data, advanced breeding strategies, and advanced agriculture practices, crop varieties could be produced with enhanced resilience and increased productivity and nutrition, supporting future global food security.
