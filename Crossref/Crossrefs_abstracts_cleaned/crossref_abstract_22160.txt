ABSTRACT
Global climate changes such as prolonged duration and intensity of drought can lead to adverse ecological consequences in forests. Currently little is known about soil microbial community responses to such drought regimes in tropical forests. In this study, we examined the resistance and resilience of topsoil prokaryotic communities to a prolongation of the dry season in terms of diversity, community structure and co-occurrence patterns in a French Guianan tropical forest. Through excluding rainfall during and after the dry season, a simulated prolongation of the dry season by five months was compared to controls. Our results show that prokaryotic communities increasingly diverged from controls with the progression of rain exclusion. Furthermore, prolonged drought significantly affected microbial co-occurrence networks. However, both the composition and co-occurrence networks of soil prokaryotic communities immediately ceased to differ from controls when precipitation throughfall returned. This study thus suggests modest resistance but high resilience of microbial communities to a prolonged drought in tropical rainforest soils.
