Salinity and cadmium (Cd) contamination of soil are serious environmental issues threatening food security. This study investigated the role of salicylic acid (SA) and potassium (K) in enhancing the resilience of quinoa against the combined stress of salinity and Cd. Quinoa plants were grown under NaCl (0, 200 mM) and Cd (0, 100 ÂµM) stress, with the addition of 0.1 mM SA and 10 mM K, separately or in combination. The joint stress of Cd and NaCl caused >50% decrease in plant growth, chlorophyll contents, and stomatal conductance compared to the control plants. The higher accumulation of Na and Cd reduced the uptake of K in quinoa tissues. The joint stress of salinity and Cd caused an 11-fold increase in hydrogen peroxide and 13-fold increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances contents, and caused a 61% decrease in membrane stability. An external supply of 0.1 mM SA and 10 mM K helped plants to better adapt to salinity and Cd stress with less of a reduction in plant biomass (shoot 19% and root 24%) and less accumulation of Na and Cd in plant tissues. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were enhanced by 11-fold, 10-fold, 7.7-fold, and 7-fold, respectively, when SA and K were applied together to the plants subjected to the joint stress of Cd and salinity. Based on the values of the bioconcentration factor (>1), the translocation factor (<1), and the higher tolerance index, it was clear that Cd-contaminated, salty soils could be stabilized with quinoa under the combined supply of SA and K.
