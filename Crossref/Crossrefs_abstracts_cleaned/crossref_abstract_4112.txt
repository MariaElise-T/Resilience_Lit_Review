PurposeIn the supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) there seems to be no consensus about measures for performance evaluation and suitable criteria from resilience and sustainability paradigms. In this way, this research aims to identify the attributes that a supply chain (SC) should follow to be resilient and sustainable, and then to evaluate their importance according to industry experts.Design/methodology/approachThis study suggests a hybrid approach. The authors identified the most commonly used criteria using literature review, and then applied fuzzy Delphi technique (FDT) with the objective of surveying experts to find the attributes used in practice and asked to assess their relevance.FindingsThe resilient-sustainable supply chain (RSSC) is formed by four dimensions: resiliency, economic, environmental and social. A total of 15 criteria are identified, and the most important are visibility, flexibility, supply chain risk management (SCRM) culture, work conditions and communication.Research limitations/implicationsThis study used a literature review, so it is subject to a time frame, and the criteria could no longer be relevant as the time and business conditions change. Also, the findings may not be completely applicable throughout different industries, and therefore the finding cannot be replicated to other businesses.Practical implicationsThis study will assist decision-makers among other interested parties to construct and/or strengthen an integrated SC that mixes resiliency and sustainability.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the state-of-art by producing a characterization of the resilient and sustainable supply chain for the automotive industry. Also, this research produces a new and holistic framework for resilient and sustainable SCPM supporting the decision-making process.
