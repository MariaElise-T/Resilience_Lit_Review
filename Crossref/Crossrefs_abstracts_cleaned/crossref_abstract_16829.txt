Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that often causes depression. Early life experience affects brain development and relates to depression. Whether the effect of different MS protocols in early life on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in female offspring with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis is unknown. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to no separation (NMS), brief MS (15 min/day, MS15) or long MS (180 min/day, MS180) from postpartum days (PPD) 1 to PPD21. Then, 5% imiquimod cream was applied for 8 days in adults. Behavioral tests, skin lesions and hippocampal protein expression were also assessed. Results: We found significant psoriasis-like skin lesions in female mice following IMQ application, and mice showed anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Further, increased microglial activation and decreased expression of neuroplasticity were detected in mice following IMQ application. However, after MS15 in early life, mice showed decreased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, indicating resilience. Further, inhibited hippocampal neuroinflammation and increased neuroplasticity were detected. Conclusions: Collectively, this study confirms that brief MS confers resilience to the behavior deficits in female offspring with IMQ-induced psoriasis and reverses the activation of neuroinflammation and the damage of neuroplasticity injury.
