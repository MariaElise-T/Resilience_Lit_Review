AbstractDecades of research have demonstrated that experiencing workplace unfairness can result in profound negative consequences for employees. Integrating conservation of resources theory with meaning‐finding perspectives, we argue that engaging in meaning‐finding in the aftermath of unfairness can foster state resilience and promote positive outcomes. To promote meaning‐finding, we develop and test a new expressive writing intervention (i.e. a guided writing technique that facilitates the processing of negative experiences). Results indicate that the meaning‐finding expressive writing intervention is associated with higher resilience than traditional expressive writing. Moreover, resilience mediates the relationship between meaning‐finding (vs. traditional) expressive writing and willingness to reconcile, positive relationships with others, and life satisfaction. Theoretically, our findings highlight that engaging in meaning‐finding can transform aversive experiences into opportunities to foster resilience and positive outcomes. Practically, meaning‐finding expressive writing provides an effective, simple, and cost‐effective tool that can be used by employees and counseling programs to promote recovery.
