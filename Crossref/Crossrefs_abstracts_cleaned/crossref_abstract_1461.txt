Multi-microgrids address the need for a resilient, sustainable, and cost-effective electricity supply by providing a coordinated operation of individual networks. Due to local generation, dynamic network topologies, and islanding capabilities of hosted microgrids or groups thereof, various new fault mitigation and optimization options emerge. However, with the great flexibility, new challenges such as complex failure modes that need to be considered for a resilient operation, appear. This work systematically reviews scheduling approaches which significantly influence the feasibility of mitigation options before a failure is encountered. An in-depth analysis of identified key contributions covers aspects such as the mathematical apparatus, failure models and validation to highlight the current methodical spectrum and to identify future perspectives. Despite the common optimization-based framework, a broad variety of scheduling approaches is revealed. However, none of the key contributions provides practical insights beyond lab validation and considerable effort is required until the approaches can show their full potential in practical implementations. It is expected that the great level of detail guides further research in improving and validating existing scheduling concepts as well as it, in the long run, aids engineers to choose the most suitable options regarding increasingly resilient power systems.
