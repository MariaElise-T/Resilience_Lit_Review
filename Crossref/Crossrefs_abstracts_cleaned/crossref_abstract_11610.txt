Depression is associated with frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and Psychological Resilience (PR), although in different ways. Only cursory attention has been given to how these three constructs interact despite the possible clinical and research implications of those associations. One limitation of recent research into these associations has been conceptualising PR as a unitary construct, whereas it has been shown to be multi-component. This study investigated the underlying components of PR, their correlations with FAA, and the effect that participantsâ€™ depressive status had upon those correlations in a community sample of 54 males and 46 females aged between 18 yr and 75 years. Results confirmed the overall inverse association between total PR and depression for four of the original five PR components and for one of the two components found in this sample. Similarly, there were differences between the ways that FAA and PR components were associated, depending upon the depressive status of participants. Source localisation data indicated that the PR components were not uniformly correlated with alpha activity in the same brain regions. These findings of content, efficacy, and neurophysiological differences between the five components of PR and their associations with FAA argue against consideration of PR as a unitary construct.
