 The anchoring effect is the over-reliance on an initial piece of information when making decisions. It is one of the most pervasive and robust biases. Recently, literature has focused on knowing how influential the anchoring effect is when applied to information visualization, with studies finding its reproducibility in the field. Despite the extensive literature surrounding the anchoring effect’s robustness, there is still a need for research on which individual differences make people more susceptible. We explore how Locus of Control influences visualization’s ubiquitous and resilient anchoring effect. Locus of Control differentiates individuals who believe their life depends on their behavior or actions from those who blame outside factors such as destiny or luck for their life’s outcomes. We focus on the relationship between Locus of Control and the anchoring effect by exposing subjects to an anchor and analyzing their interaction with a complex visualization. Our results show that the anchoring strategies primed individuals and suggest that the Locus of Control plays a role in the susceptibility to the anchoring effect.
