Disasters and crisis situations are unforeseen events. When a disaster occurs, the most critical step after the intervention at the scene is the health and treatment services provided in hospitals. Since it is of vital importance that hospitals, where health services are provided, are accessible and operational when faced with natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes, fires, epidemics, CBRN events, wars, and crises such as cyber-attacks, economic problems, hospitals must protect themselves against a disaster hazard and plan what to do during and after the disaster. This review was written to emphasize the importance of hospitals and their resilience in times of crisis and disaster.Hospitals can enhance their resilience by strengthening both their physical and social aspects. It is essential to create resistance in hospitals not against specific dangers such as fire and earthquake, but against all crises that may occur in the system. A hospital must first identify its structural and non-structural risks to enhance its physical resilience. To enhance social resilience, a hospital should plan its organisations and human resources, establish accurate information communication, and engage in logistics and financial planning. It is crucial to guarantee uninterrupted patient care and all supportive services. Measures should be taken for decontamination and evacuation of patients when necessary while also ensuring the overall security of the hospital. As a result, hospital resilience plays a critical role in maintaining healthcare services, effectively managing emergencies, and generally protecting public health. Further studies are needed to strengthen this resistance.
