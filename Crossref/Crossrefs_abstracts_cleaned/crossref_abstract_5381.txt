This study employed a descriptive qualitative design. It was conducted from January 2019 to July 2019 after the IRB approval. Purposive sampling was used to recruit study participants. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews until the data saturation point was reached. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was done to analyze the data. The process through which nurses develop resilience during their professional career took place in three main phases: challenges and stresses faced during their nursing career, coping process utilization, and capacity building. These phases are supported by motivation and professional commitment. The core theme was the resilience-building among nurses during their nursing careers. Pakistani nurses are managing those stresses that have been resolved in developed countries. There is less external motivation to work in nursing; rather, Pakistani nurses are motivating themselves through self-realization and self-motivation strategies. The important pillars of resilience-building are family support, toughening up, spirituality, self-motivation, and commitment. Resilience among novice nurses should be strengthened and developed through resilience-building interventions.
