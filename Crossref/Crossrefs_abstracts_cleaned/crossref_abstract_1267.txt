Abstract
This article attempts to determine, solely from the aspect of vibration reduction, the criteria which define a good antivibration mount material. It concludes firstly that such a material should possess a high damping factor which does not increase greatly with frequency, and secondly, that it should be free from any major increase in dynamic modulus with frequency. Results of transmissibility measurements on a variety of resilient materials indicate that high damping synthetic rubbers normally possess a dynamic modulus which increases rapidly with frequency. It is shown that this modulus increase is responsible for the poor isolation afforded by these rubbers at frequencies above the resonant frequency of the mounting system, and not their inherent high damping as commonly supposed. Filled butyl rubber is an exception, affording an isolation at high frequencies not greatly inferior to that of natural rubber, yet at the same time possessing much higher damping.
