Abstract
In this study, we examined the cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia by evaluating the clinical, cognitive, resilience, and coping correlates of cerebellar signs (CSs) in 162 subjects (63 patients with schizophrenia and 99 healthy controls). The presence of CS was evaluated based on six clinical tests. Measures to assess the severity of psychopathology, cognitive functioning, resilience, and frequency of coping strategies used were included. Patients had more CS than controls. Patients with more CS were older, had more severe psychopathology, had poorer performance on Brief Assessment of Cognition for Schizophrenia token motor task, and used less self-distraction as a coping strategy than those with fewer CS. Patients without CS used less self-blame coping at higher level of resilience. The association of less self-distraction with more CS may be related to cognitive inflexibility as a result of cerebellar dysfunction. Greater attentiveness to the presence of CS in schizophrenia patients may aid in better management of their psychotic condition.
