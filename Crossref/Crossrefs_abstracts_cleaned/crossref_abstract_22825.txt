Abstract. Recent advances in modelling capabilities and data processing combined with vastly improved observation tools and networks have resulted in the expansion of available weather and climate information, from historical observations to seasonal climate forecasts, as well as decadal climate predictions and multi-decadal climate change projections. However, it remains a key challenge to ensure this information reaches the intended climate-sensitive sectors (e.g. water, energy, agriculture, health), and is fit-for-purpose to guarantee the usability of climate information for these downstream users. Climate information can be produced on demand via climate resilience information systems which are existing in various forms. To optimise the efficiency and establish better information exchange between these systems, standardisation is necessary. Here, standards and deployment options are described for how scientific methods can be be deployed in climate resilience information systems, respecting the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Besides the general description of OGC-API Standards and OGC-API Processes based on existing building blocks, ongoing developments in AI-enhanced services for climate services are described.
