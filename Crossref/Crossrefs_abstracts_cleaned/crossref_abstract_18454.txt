Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the resilience of adolescents participants and non-participants of social projects for sports relating it to their sociodemographic profile. Cross-section Study, comparative and analytical, covered 134 adolescents, from ages 12 to 17, residing in a social zone of high vulnerability in a Northeastern Brazilian city. The data collected was obtained through structured interviews and a questionnaire/resilience scale, developed by Wagnild and Young (1993). The descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was used, especially the Student ‘T’ Test for the independent samples and the chi-square test. In both cases, the statistical significance level adopted was p < 0.05. The overall mean resilience was 110.6 (±15.9) and the participants in social projects demonstrated better resilience (p = 0.063), with a predominance of male gender, age group 15 to 17 years old, without health problems, parents (father/mother) self-employed, retired, pensioner or unemployed with income less than 1 minimum wage, without alcohol/cigarette and other drugs. The participants of the social projects presented a better level of resilience, even though there were several unfavorable situations and many risks presented as well.
