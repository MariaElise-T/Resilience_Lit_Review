There are several catastrophic events that can happen in a city. Occurrences that present themselves with different origins and magnitudes. In the midst of this, the organization and preparation of municipalities in order to avoid or mitigate disasters become fundamental. In this context, some of the strategies involve consensus based on previous experiences added to studies and surveys supported by large organizations. From this, concepts were raised that relate before, during and after possible events. For a general assessment, it is essential to report information related to terms such as 'Resilience' and 'Humanitarian Logistics'. Within this perspective, the municipality of Juiz de Fora (MG) was studied as a practical case, considering the measures taken by the city in order to avoid catastrophes. Evaluating the possible solutions that can be used in the local context, it was demonstrated that, through the integration between different sectors of the public administration, it is possible to transform the reality of the residents of the region, bringing them greater security.
