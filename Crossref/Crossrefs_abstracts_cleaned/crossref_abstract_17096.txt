Abstract
The United Nations as well as the European Union are strongly committed in promoting a transition towards more sustainable and resilient cities. Indeed, they are increasingly affected by different types of threats, among which the natural ones such as earthquakes, fires, and floods (shocks) and climate variability (stresses). Cities are quite often unable to cope with the adverse effects of such natural hazards. This circumstance leads to the need of introducing resilience-related criteria (besides commonly used sustainability indicators) in decision-making processes. This paper investigates at which extent the inclusion of such new indicators, within multi-criteria assessment tools for supporting the decision-making process by Public Administrations, modifies the prioritization processes of a given set of planned actions to be implemented in cities, which are based instead on the above-cited commonly used indicators. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrated that the introduction of resilience among the prioritization criteria significantly modifies the list of priorities established using only sustainability indicators.
