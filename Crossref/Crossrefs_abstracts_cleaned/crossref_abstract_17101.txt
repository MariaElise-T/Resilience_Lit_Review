This study investigates consumer perceptions and acceptance of innovative strategies implemented to counter the effects of climate change in the wine industry. The acceptance of wines derived from grapes grown using four different vineyard management practices—kaolin application, use of plant growth regulators, introduction of resilient rootstocks, and fungus-resistant grape varieties (PIWI)—is analyzed. Utilizing a latent profile analysis, the study identifies five distinct consumer profiles, each displaying unique sensitivities and perceptions towards climate change threats. The findings reveal notable variations in consumers’ willingness to accept these innovations. Additionally, the study offers insights into how these preferences influence the marketability of wines produced using these innovative techniques. The overall results depict heterogeneous acceptance of these practices. Consumers seem more inclined to choose wines derived from vines with innovative rootstocks and those treated with kaolin. The acceptance for PIWI varieties and PGR is comparatively marginal. The outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for winegrowers, policymakers, and other industry stakeholders on effectively implementing and communicating these solutions. Overall, the research findings contribute significantly to understanding consumer behavior within the context of climate change in the wine industry, presenting substantial implications for sustainable viticulture practices and wine marketing strategies.
