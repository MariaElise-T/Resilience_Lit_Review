ABSTRACT:

Objective:
The aim of this study was to examine the moderating role of resilience in the relationship between sense of stress and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in mothers of children with cystic fibrosis (CF).


Methods:
This cross-sectional study was conducted in a group of 139 mothers of children with CF. A diagnostic survey with Polish versions of the inventories was used.


Results:
Over half of the mothers (52.89%) reported average and 26.11% high levels of general sense of stress. Mothers also experienced high (37.68%) and average (34.06%) PTG. Generally, mothers of children with CF manifested low general resilience. Sense of stress and PTG were significantly and positively correlated in this group of mothers. Positive correlations were revealed between resilience (total and individual dimensions), total PTG, and 1 dimension of PTG: changes in self-perception. Moreover, resilience was found to correlate with sense of stress. The obtained results indicate that resilience manifested as an optimistic life attitude and the ability to mobilize in difficult situations, and tolerance of failures and treating life as a challenge is a moderator in the relationship between sense of stress and PTG.


Conclusion:
The relationship between sense of stress and PTG in mothers of children with CF depends on the level of resilience.
