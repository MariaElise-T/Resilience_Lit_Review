 Cyclic plate load testing is commonly used to investigate subgrade response under repetitive loads. Two frameworks for performing inverse analysis are described for backcalculating resilient moduli on the basis of measured key outputs. In the first approach, an elastic modulus is back-calculated in each selected domain; in the second, selected parameters in the resilient modulus model are estimated. The axisymmetric finite element model analysis results suggest that the second approach is more robust because it allows the modulus to be distributed in the selected domain. A series of sensitivity analyses was conducted with the second approach to illustrate how the assumed properties or model geometry affects the backcalculated parameters. Discrepancies between the back-calculated parameters and their known values were observed when the distance to the boundary–-that is, the radial distance from centerline to sidewall–-was not properly assigned. When backcalculating only selected parameters in the resilient modulus equation, it is necessary to assign the other parameters carefully (i.e., from laboratory tests or references). An example analysis shows the application of the proposed approach to an actual plate load test.
