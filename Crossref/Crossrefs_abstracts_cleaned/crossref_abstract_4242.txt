Abstract
The Settlement of the Musi Riverside in Palembang City is the strongest attraction for the community to build settlements. These settlement of the Musi Riverside, which have been inhabited for generations, has architectural and cultural aspects that reflect traditions that still survive. However, the communityâ€™s need for housing and riverside infrastructure that extends to cover river catchment areas actually causes changes in land topography, changes in water management, and even river widths that cause urban flooding. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct the resilience of residential infrastructure on the banks of the Musi River, Palembang in the face of urban flooding. This study uses a quantitative method with descriptive analysis, which is made in cross tabulation and based on a geographic information system (GIS). The results showed that the resilience of riverbank infrastructure in the settlements of 5 Ulu and 7 Ulu in dry land was in the form of road expansion, while in wetlands it was in the form of expansion of concrete roads. The direction in reconstructing the disaster resilience of riverside settlements based on exogenous and endogenous aspects is to plan infrastructure criteria for good riverside land.
