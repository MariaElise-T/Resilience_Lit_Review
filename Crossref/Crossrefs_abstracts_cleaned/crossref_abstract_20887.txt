 Trauma, socio-economic, cultural and structural issues are associated with poor outcomes for most health conditions and may also make research participation difficult and onerous, perpetuating intervention-generated inequalities by generating evidence from those least in need. Trauma-informed and resilience-informed approaches to care may help address these concerns across health and social care research. These approaches take an empowerment-based response to adversity, and are suitable for integration and extension as Trauma and Resilience Informed Research Principles and Practice (TRIRPP) for studies beyond the topics of resilience and trauma. Four TRIRPP aims were identified: addressing the adversity context that may underpin the lives of research participants and the phenomenon under study; improving study accessibility and acceptability for individuals and populations facing adversity; recognising and addressing traumatisation in potential participants; and recognising and promoting resilience. Recommendations include interview participant control of recording devices, over-sampling of under-represented populations in population surveys, and actively seeking to engage disenfranchised individuals in patient and public involvement from design to dissemination. The practice of research has the power to address adversity and trauma or to perpetuate it at both an individual and a societal level. It is feasible and worthwhile to integrate trauma-informed and resilience-informed approaches across research topics and designs. Further work should extend the TRIRPP recommendations and evaluate their use.
