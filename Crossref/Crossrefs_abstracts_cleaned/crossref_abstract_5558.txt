Early and ongoing monitoring of post-fire recovery dynamics is critical for understanding the ecological resilience of forests. The unprecedented scale of Australia’s Black Summer of 2019–2020 poses a significant challenge for post-fire recovery monitoring. Remote sensing is the only practical way to undertake broad-scale analysis of post-fire recovery dynamics. We used Sentinel 2 satellite imagery to compare pre-fire and 1-year post-fire Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) values. A strong positive trend in the return of vegetation was indicated where post-fire values met or exceeded 80% of the pre-fire NBR value. Our assessment highlighted locations where early recovery responses were divergent from trends in the surrounding areas. Overall, there was a strong spectral recovery across the 2019–2020 south-east Australia fire extent, with more than 50% of the total burned area showing greater than 80% spectral recovery after 1 year. However, several areas where ecosystem resilience may be threatened were identified, including fire-sensitive ecosystems and severely drought-impacted regions. Our results demonstrated biogeographic variation in the effect of fire severity on post-fire spectral recovery, with little effect of severity on spectral recovery observed in the north-east, but much stronger effects in the south. Our study highlights further research for prioritisation as part of adaptive land management programs.
