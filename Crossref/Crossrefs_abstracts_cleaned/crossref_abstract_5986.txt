AbstractIt has been argued that current interest in co‐operatives is because they can reduce poverty and are resilient organisations. However, histories of co‐operatives' successes and failures suggest that co‐operative organisational resilience needs better understanding. This article reviews the literature, particularly with respect to sub‐Saharan Africa. It argues that co‐operative organisational resilience centres on co‐operatives' multidimensionality and the development of collective capability in five mutually reinforcing areas of activity. These are membership, networks, collective skills in governance, innovation and engagement with governments. Together, they strengthen co‐operatives' resilience, but where lacking, they undermine it. The article adds to thinking about ‘co‐operative advantage’. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
