Abstract. The article considers "human resilience" as a meta-ability. The difficulty of comparing research results due to various psychological approaches and methods is noted. The necessity of studying not only the socio-psychological and psychological levels of human resilience, but also its psychophysiological level is substantiated. The author offers a level and component structure of human resilience. The data of an empirical study are presented aimed at studying the conditionality of human resilience by the features of temperament and control of behavior. The control of behavior is considered the ability for voluntary and conscious self-regulation, emotional intelligence and coping mechanisms determined by cognitive, emotional and volitional abilities. Materials and methods. The following methods were used: Self-regulation profile questionnaire, J. Strelau Pavlovian Temperament Survey (PTS), Ways of Coping Questionnaire (OSS – WCQ), EmIn emotional intelligence questionnaire, Resilience Research Center Adult Resilience Measure (RRC-ARM). Results. As a result of multiple regression analysis of the data, crucial individual characteristics of resilience (within the considered components) were identified. These include: “General level of emotional intelligence”, “Balance of nervous processes”, “Search for social support” as a coping strategy and “Planning” as a mechanism of subjective self-regulation. It is shown that emotional intelligence, the ability to seek help from other people and independently set life goals can be developed through education and psychotherapy.
