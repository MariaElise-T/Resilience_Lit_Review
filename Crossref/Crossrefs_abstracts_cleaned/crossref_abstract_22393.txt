AbstractIonic conductive gels are widely sought after for applications that require reliable ionic conduction and mechanical performance under extreme conditions, which remains a grand challenge. To address this limitation, water‐induced hydration interactions are deliberately controlled within the ionic liquid (IL)‐based conductive gels (ionogels) to achieve all‐round performance. Specifically, the competitive interactions between IL, water and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) are balanced to preserve the nanoscale morphology of CNF while avoiding its dissolution. As a result, both mechanical performance and ionic conductivity of the resultant ionogel are synergistically enhanced. For instance, an ultra stretchable ionogel (up to 10250 ± 412% stretchability) with both high toughness (21.8 ± 0.9 MJ m−3) and ionic conductivity (0.70 ± 0.06 S m−1) is achieved. Furthermore, multimodal sensing functions (strain, compression, temperature, and humidity) are realized by assembling the ionogel as a skin‐like membrane. Due to the low volatility of IL and its strong interaction with water, the ionogel maintains an excellent performance at either ultra‐low temperature (−45 °C), high temperature (75 °C) or low humidity environment (RH < 15%), demonstrating superb anti‐freezing and anti‐drying performance. Overall, a simple yet versatile strategy is introduced that leads to environmentally resilient ionogels to meet the requirements of next‐generation electroactive devices.
