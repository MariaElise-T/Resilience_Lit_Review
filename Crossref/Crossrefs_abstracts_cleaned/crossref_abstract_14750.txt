During the past two decades, critical infrastructures (CIs) faced a growing number of challenges worldwide due to natural disasters and other disruptive events. To respond to and handle these disasters and disruptive events, the concept of resilience was introduced to CIs. Particularly, many institutions and scholars developed various types of frameworks to assess and enhance CI resilience. The purpose of this paper is to review the resilience assessment frameworks of the CIs proposed by quality papers published in the past decade, determine and analyze the common dimensions and the key indicators of resilience assessment frameworks of CIs, and propose possible opportunities for future research. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, which identified 24 resilience assessment frameworks from 24 quality papers. This paper contributes to the current body of resilience research by identifying the common dimensions and the key indicators of the resilience assessment frameworks proposed for CIs. In addition, this paper is beneficial to the practice, because it provides a comprehensive view of the resilience assessment frameworks of CIs from the perspective of implementation, and the indicators are pragmatic and actionable in practice.
