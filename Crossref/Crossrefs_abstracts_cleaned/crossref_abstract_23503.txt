Kidney disease is often progressive, and patients experience diminished health-related quality of life. In addition, the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and its associated restrictions, has brought many additional burdens. It is therefore essential that effective and affordable systems are explored to improve the psychological health of this group that can be delivered safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to support a new service development project in partnership with the UKâ€™s leading patient support charity Kidney Care UK by implementing the four-session Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, and explore its effectiveness for patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease or have received a kidney transplant. The study will utilise a quasi-experimental, pretest/posttest design to measure the effect of the CMR programme on anxiety, depression, self-compassion, the ability to be mindful, wellbeing, and resilience, using pre- and posttests, alongside a qualitative exploration to explore factors influencing the feasibility, acceptability, and suitability of the intervention, with patients (and the Mindfulness Teacher) and their commitment to practice. Outcomes from this study will include an evidence-based mindfulness and compassion programme for use with people with kidney disease, which is likely to have applicability across other chronic diseases.
