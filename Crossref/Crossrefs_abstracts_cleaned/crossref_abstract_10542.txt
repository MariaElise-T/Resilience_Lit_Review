For road infrastructures, the concepts of sustainability and resilience are becoming more and more relevant.
The sustainability is closely linked with the concept of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The resilience is usually connected with the occurrence
of extreme events or unusual disturbances (earthquake, landslide, floods) during the life cycle of infrastructures
and refers to their ability of recover the previous functionality. Usually, the two concepts that account for two desired
qualities of the infrastructures are applied following separate approaches. Better choices in road design, maintenance
and rehabilitation should lead to an improvement of both qualities. On the other hand, an in deep analysis of the sustainability
and resilience demonstrates a significant number of similar characteristics. In the light of the above premises,
in the present paper, the suitability of an integrated approach in the choice of the rehabilitation alternatives after an extreme
event is evaluated. A method to assess the sustainability, based on life cycle costs, and to estimate the resilience is
setup. It resulted that an integrated perspective can be pursued and both resilience and sustainability allow addressing
an appropriate amount of technical, economic and environmental/social issues and can lead to identifying the most efficient
solution of rehabilitation.
