This study is an attempt to think, interpret and analyze the concept of resilience and to study the factors and mechanisms that result from it under the influence of historical, psychic, social and cultural challenges. Boris Cyrulnik defines resilience as a "biological, psycho-affective, social and cultural process that allows a new development after psychic trauma". It is thus presented as an experience that can only be lived after going through various shocks, turbulences and disturbances, whether individual or collective. The two novels of Alexandre Najjar Le syndrome de Beyrouth and Charif Majdalani Beyrouth 2020 Journal d'un effondrement seem to offer an ideal space for studying this question, given that the recent history of Lebanon (from 1970 to 2021), punctuated by wars and traumas both psychic and physical, forms a base for the writing of the two novels. The two authors manage to reproduce the events through the eyes of the Lebanese people engulfed by crises and wars, sometimes with the aim of incriminating one or the other, sometimes with the aim of fighting or simply giving up, but also to show that it is when History is at the height of its complexity placing man under the seal of trauma and rupture that resilience emerges and that important alternatives quickly arise. How to understand resilience in the light of political and socio-economic upheavals, in a context of instability, and where wars, disasters and pandemics risk setting the individual into resignation? In other words, how could the individual and the community forge a system of internal reorganization, in view of better endurance of successive shocks? By answering these questions, we seek in this comparative study to show the convergences and divergences of these two novels in relation to the issue of trauma and resilience.
