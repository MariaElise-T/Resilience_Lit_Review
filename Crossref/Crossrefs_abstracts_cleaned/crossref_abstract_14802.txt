Abstract. The research project’s objective, based on defining a “Computational Model of Intersections Simulation/Representation” as complex digital cultural infrastructure and computational knowledge, acquires the identity characteristics of the Computational Representation (phenomenological, geometry, visual, resilience, scalability analytical-interpretative knowledge) to promote for landscape and Cultural Heritage (CH): a) of systematize environmental information and protective by intersections of resilience’s categories in the “thematic systems of families and types” of the landscape; b) a model of Smart CH for Industry 4.0 – 2021. The same time favors: a) thematic and retrospective intersections between formal and interpretative layers for the return of information from a spatial and functional; b) innovation by introduction of professional figures of the contemporary digital. The methodology is articulated on following intersection models: Connotations, Composition, Development (combination of complex formal, structural and geometric factors); Morphogenesis (innovative concepts of transformations form), Sustainability. From the point of view the results and conclusion the study allowed to highlight: a) “network of multi-scalar discrete relationships” with sequences of digital models for the relative tessellation of the surfaces; b) “resilience measure” by “building a digital model of morphogenesis”; c) systematize environmental information and protective by intersections of resilience’s categories in the “thematic systems of families and types” of the landscape; d) “operative and phenomenological reading” of the changing complexity of environmental reality with connections between the behavioural and physical structures of the place.
