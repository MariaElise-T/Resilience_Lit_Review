Abstract
Urban resilience is a critical issue for cities around the world facing a range of challenges such as natural disasters, climate change, and socio-economic crises. The multi-dimensional nature of urban resilience suggests that it is dependent on a variety of factors, including physical infrastructure, social networks, economic systems, and governance structures. This paper examines the dependencies of urban resilience on different elements in a comparative study of five cities. A comprehensive review of the existing literature on urban resilience identifies key dimensions and elements of urban resilience, including physical infrastructure, social networks, economic systems, and governance structures. Factors that contribute to urban resilience, including the quality of physical infrastructure, social capital, economic diversity, environmental quality, and effective governance structures, are also discussed. A mixed-methods approach was used in the study, including a literature review and empirical research. Five cities were selected for examination: Tokyo, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, and Lagos. The empirical data on the dependencies of urban resilience on different elements are presented for each of the five cities, followed by a discussion of the interplay between different elements and how they contribute to urban resilience.
