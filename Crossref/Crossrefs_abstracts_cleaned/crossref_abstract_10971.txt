The aim of this study was to verify the correlations between three types of self-efficacy and factors of resilience in a sample of 155 Italian early adolescents. We used the following measures: the Scholastic Self-efficacy Scale, the Empathic Self-efficacy Scale, and the Problem solving Self-efficacy Scale (Caprara, 2001) and the Resiliency Attitudes and Skills Profile (De Caroli & Sagone, 2014). Results demonstrated that early adolescents highly self-efficient in problem solving and in scholastic performances, and those who reported a higher empathic self-efficacy tended to express a greater resilience than lowly self-efficient ones. Future research could deepen these significant relations in children and adults.
