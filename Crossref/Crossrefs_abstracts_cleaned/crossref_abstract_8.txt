The aim of this paper is to identify the dimensions of resilience undertaken in literature, characteristics describing resilient systems and spatial scales in the context of which resilience research and strategic planning are carried out. The research method was desk research within which the papers that were reviewed were selected based on scientific journal reputation including the high Impact Factor. References to resilience in strategic planning were selected on the basis of information about international organizations dealing with resilience mentioned in scientific articles. Based on broad review, environmental, social, economic and institutional resilience have been identified. Important properties of social-ecological systems identified in the context of resilience include connectivity, modularity, redundancy, interdependence, and diversification, while resilience strategies specifically consider flexibility, resourcefulness, reflectiveness, dispersion, mutuality, inclusion, and integration. Research as well as strategic actions to strengthen resilience consider global spatial scale but also national, regional, local, neighbourhood, household and individual.
