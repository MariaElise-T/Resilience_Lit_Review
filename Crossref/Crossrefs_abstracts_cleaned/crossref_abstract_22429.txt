AbstractAimThe COVID‐19 outbreak in Taiwan had a significant impact on medical services. These changes posed a threat to nurses' mental health. Resilience may protect nurses from the psychological impact of COVID‐19. This study aimed to understand nurses' resilience and its relationship with nurses' characteristics (life and work situations) and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress) during the outbreak.DesignA cross‐sectional study.MethodsThis study surveyed the nurses at a hospital from 9 August 2021, to 20 August 2021. The content of the questionnaire included nurses' characteristics, resilience and mental health.ResultsThere was an association between higher resilience and lower mental health problems. We also found that some nurses' characteristics were positively correlated with mental health problems.ConclusionSome nurses' life and work situations predicted high levels of mental health problems during the pandemic. Additionally, higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of mental health problems.
