Intense urbanization creates large cities that are functionally and administratively dependent on the surrounding regions and cities. As the boundaries of cities expand, so do the chronic stresses and sudden shocks they face. To reduce the impact of these threats and increase the safety and well-being of residents, metropolises must become more resilient and sustainable. Governance emerges as a critical element in achieving the resilience and sustainable development of metropolises. It is said that “good urban governance and sustainable development are closely linked”. This paper examines governance in the context of the 100 Resilient Cities network program and tries to diagnose the role that good governance plays at a metropolitan scale in achieving urban resilience and sustainable development using the 100 RC network’s metropolitan US cities as a case study. It adopts a combined methodology, and its critical documents are (a) The City Resilience Framework and (b) the strategic study of metropolises. This article aspires to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between urban governance, urban resilience, and sustainable development, and highlights good urban governance as an important tool for the effective management of chronic pressures and risks in cities.
