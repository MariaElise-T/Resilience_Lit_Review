AbstractThis paper demonstrates an enhancement in resiliency and rebound properties of vinyl plastisol based materials incorporating hollow thermoplastic microspheres; and their characterization using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis involving the time‚Äêtemperature superposition technique. These materials have a wide range of applications, including automotive underbody coatings, gaskets, sealants, and recreational and athletic articles.
