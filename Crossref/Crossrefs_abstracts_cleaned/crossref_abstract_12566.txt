ABSTRACTIt has become important in the fields of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and resilience assessment that both disciplines begin to be considered together as complementary approaches aimed at achieving the same goals. There is a great advantage to combining the EIA methodology with a synergetic concept such as resilience, and thereby contributing to a more insightful and effective EIA process. A comprehensive approach is vital for effective assessment and management of environmental impacts and to support better decision making with regard to different planned interventions and socioecological systems. In this paper, we advocate for a hybrid environmental assessment model that combines EIA and resilience assessment. This proposed assessment approach expands the capacity of EIA to evaluate and manage the uncertainties and unexpected outcomes associated with human and natural environmental impacts.
