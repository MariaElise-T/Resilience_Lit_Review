AbstractAimTo evaluate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the emotional and spiritual well‐being and resilience of a global sample of Advanced Practice Nurses.DesignA web‐based cross‐sectional mixed methods study. Survey data were collected from Advanced Practice Nurses globally over a 2‐month period ending on 31 August 2020.MethodsThe Warwick‐Edinburgh Mental Well‐being Scale, FACIT‐12 Spiritual Well‐being Scale and Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale 10 were used to quantify emotional and spiritual well‐being and resilience of Advanced Practice Nurses' globally. The survey was distributed internationally using snowball sampling via a secure platform (Qualtrics). Results were analysed using various bivariate tests for associations and group differences.ResultsNine hundred and twenty‐eight Advanced Practice Nurses from 53 countries participated in the study. Study participants reported meaningfully lower scores in resilience and emotional well‐being compared with non‐pandemic scores. Participants from countries with well‐developed Advanced Practice Nurses roles reported lower resilience and well‐being scores compared with those from countries where Advanced Practice Nurses roles are still being developed. Each scale revealed significant positive associations with the other scales.ConclusionsEmotional and spiritual well‐being and resilience of Advance Practice Nurses has been significantly impacted during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Regardless of their work location, work hours, credential or demographics, the APNs in our study reported lower levels of resilience and mental well‐being compared with typical scores on the instruments.
