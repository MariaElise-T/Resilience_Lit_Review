 Literature has shown increasing research on resilience that can help young people deal with mental health problems and improve life satisfaction, well-being, and happiness. However, empirical evidence about the role of resilience has not been proved across cultures, especially in low- and middle-income countries. One of the reasons is the lack of valid measures for assessing resilience. Due to the sensitivity in the number of items and factors of the simple-to-use CD-RISC-10 in many studies, this study aims to achieve the following goals: (a) re-investigate the psychometric properties of CD-RISC-10 and compare those with other models to suggest a better fit structure among Vietnamese youth; (b) to explore the correlation between sociodemographic variables and resilience; (c) to examine the association between emotional intelligence and resilience; and (d) to examine the association between resilience and satisfaction of life. A cross-sectional school-based survey was conducted on 484 students. Findings revealed a valid and reliable scale of the Vietnamese version of the CD-RISC-10 with two subscales: Coping and Optimism. Resilience and its factors did not relate to sex and residence location. Findings showed a strong correlation between resilience, emotional intelligence, and life satisfaction. Emotional intelligence positively predicts resilience, which in turn positively predicts life satisfaction. Limitations and suggestions for future investigation are discussed in this paper.
