Children living in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries face a plethora of challenges that require adaptation and resilience for them to develop typically. The experiences of epidemics, armed conflicts, and many other man-made and natural disasters create abject poverty and psychological issues: the vulnerable children become orphans and/or refugees in addition to premature deaths because they lack safety nets. This article explores the role of faith (i.e., religion or spirituality) as a source of resilience with regard to chronic stressful life events experienced by children. There is need to establish the role of faith in children's lives because of the different types of adverse events that impact child development. African countries are inundated by many hazards that impact children more than any other age group and this trend requires urgent intervention by all stakeholders. At research level, there is need to conduct studies that explore, over prolonged periods of time, the processes and role of spirituality/religion (S/R) in facilitating or inhibiting children's adjustment to traumatic experiences. Additionally, at policy level, there is need for governments in SSA to implement policies, intervene and protect children; in addition to encouraging collaboration among the religious fraternity, traditional leaders, and other stakeholders to make the world a better place for children.
