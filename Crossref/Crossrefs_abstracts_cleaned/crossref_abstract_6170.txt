AbstractThe Non-Uniform k-center (NUkC) problem has recently been formulated by Chakrabarty et al. [ICALP, 2016; ACM Trans Algorithms 16(4):46:1–46:19, 2020] as a generalization of the classical k-center clustering problem. In NUkC, given a set of n points P in a metric space and non-negative numbers $$r_1, r_2, \ldots , r_k$$

-hard to approximate within any factor even in tree metrics. On the other hand, they designed a “bi-criteria” constant approximation algorithm that uses a constant times k balls. Surprisingly, no true approximation is known even in the special case when the $$r_i$$

’s belong to a constant-sized set. However, we show that perturbation resilience does not help in the general case. In particular, our findings imply that even with perturbation resilience one cannot hope to find any “good” approximation for the problem.
