AbstractIn a changing climate, it is imperative to understand potential ecosystem resilience at all taxonomic levels. I compare seasonal small mammal utilization of woodlands (tree islands) and grasslands in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, to elucidate macrohabitat relationships and to test whether the two macrohabitats are similar in their ability to serve as a source of colonizers for the other after disturbance. Capture–mark–recapture data revealed that abundances for Dendromus mesomelas and Gerbilliscus leucogaster were higher in grasslands than tree islands, while Mus indutus abundance appeared higher in the grasslands in the dry season but roughly equal in the rainy season. Mastomys spp. and Steatomys pratensis maintained low levels in the grassland habitat throughout the year and experienced a population peak in the tree island habitat during the rainy season. There were no significant differences in sex ratio, mean mass or breeding condition. Dominance and total biomass were higher in the grasslands with the trend more pronounced in the rainy season. Terrestrial small mammals in the Okavango Delta employ differing strategies in macrohabitat selection and some exploit tree islands when herbaceous cover is present. Metacommunity dynamics exist for some species, and both habitats can serve as a source of colonizers under certain conditions.
