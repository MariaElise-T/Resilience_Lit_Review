Research has revealed adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can have a negative effect on a childâ€™s development and put a child at an increased risk of physical and mental health problems in adulthood (Anda et al., 2006; Felitti et al., 1998; Gilbert et al., 2015; Putamen, 2006). Some children have been able to counteract the negative effects of ACEs and achieve positive life outcomes using a principle called resilience (Zolkoski & Bullock, 2012). The current study utilized a virtual survey to examine current interventions used by occupational therapists (OTs) and other members of the interdisciplinary team to assist children in overcoming the negative effects of ACEs. The results of the study found that occupational therapists and the wider interdisciplinary team have utilized the following interventions to assist children in developing resilience: facilitating the development of self-regulation skills and problem-solving skills, utilizing sensory based interventions, utilizing group therapy, utilizing principles of a trauma-informed approach, and referring the child to other professional services (e.g. social worker or psychological services). While many of these interventions were supported by scholarly research, OTs and members of the interdisciplinary team neglected to address multiple key protective factors in childhood resilience. Professionals working with children with ACEs may benefit from additional training in the area of childhood resilience.
