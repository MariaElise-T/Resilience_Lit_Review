Abstract
Most would agree that older adults represent a highly vulnerable group prior to, during and post disaster. Age-related vulnerabilities often lead into an increased risk for traumatic experiences and post-traumatic stress symptoms after a disaster. Trauma informed principles offer a possible way to reduce the vulnerability of older adults after a disaster. For example, utilizing the trauma informed question “what has happened to you” shifts the focus from a deficit approach and allows for a deeper understanding of the impact of traumatic life experiences on current functioning and reaction to the disaster. It is this understanding of trauma’s impact that may have a role in how older adult disaster survivors view, respond, and recover after a natural disaster (Seery et.al. 2010; Iacoviello & Charney, 2014). In addition, understanding the role of lifetime adversity provides critical insights for disaster planning, reducing vulnerability and promoting resilience among older disaster survivors.
