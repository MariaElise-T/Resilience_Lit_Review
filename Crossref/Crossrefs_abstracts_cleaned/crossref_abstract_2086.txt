AbstractThis research explores the relations between resiliency and its affective, behavioral, and cognitive protective factors and self‐regulatory processes and job search behaviors among recent immigrants. The study uses data from 201 first‐generation immigrants to test whether these self‐regulatory variables incrementally predict job search self‐efficacy, satisfaction, clarity, and intensity over and above the trait‐based protective factors. By going beyond traditional protective factors, we provide a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of immigrants’ job search behaviors. Finally, this research provides an empirical foundation for the development of future training programs aimed at enhancing immigrant resiliency and improving job search outcomes.
