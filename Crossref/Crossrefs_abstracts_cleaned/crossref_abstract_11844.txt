Abstract
In the market economy, the financial system includes a set of specialized markets, where the demand of financial resources is faced with the supply, through specific mechanisms and within a framework regulated by the financial authorities. At the macroeconomic level, the major importance of the financial system lies in the fact that it ensures, through the markets that it consists of, the mobilization of the existing financial resources available in the economy at a given time and their transfer to various investment projects. In fact, the mission of the financial system is to finance the real economy. In a versatile economic environment, the financial system is often subjected to pressure factors, shocks that can affect its “well-being”. In this context, the authors, using specific scientific research methods, aimed to investigate and highlight certain main aspects of the methodological and pragmatic framework concerning the resilience of the national financial system to different pressure factors.
