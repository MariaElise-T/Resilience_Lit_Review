Abstract
In this research, Sea-condition Emergency Alert and Warning Apparatus for Vessel Safety (SEAWAVES) is a watercraft tracking and monitoring system developed and deployed to monitor watercraft and sea conditions to provide a safer and more resilient marine communication system. The proposed method puts together an application of contemporary technology using the fused location provider Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve the deviceâ€™s current location. In addition to managing the underlying location technologies, like Global Positioning System (GPS) and Wi-Fi, the fused location provider offers a straightforward API that you may use to specify the desired level of service. The work includes calibrating the compass, GPS, and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) for watercraft tracking and monitoring using Android sensors of mobile phones. The GPS provides the present site of the watercraft; General packet radio service (GPRS) sends the tracking information to the server and thus an alert message generated is transmitted to the registered monitoring systems. This scheme is deployed in the watercraft to monitor location and sea conditions, which are to be determined on the web page and supervised in real-time. Hence, if the watercraft is at a critical level, alert messages will be sent to the monitoring system, and the registered mobile phone number of the watercraft. Also a warning display and sound are produced by the device. The SEAWAVES tracking and monitoring system could be recommended for use onboard a watercraft throughout the country for effective management and monitoring of the performance of such watercraft, and low-cost instrumentation as a stand-alone system through modern technologies.
