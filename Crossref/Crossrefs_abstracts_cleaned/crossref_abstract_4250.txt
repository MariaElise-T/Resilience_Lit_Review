Abstract
In the current scenario of massive urbanization and global climate change, the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development identifies among the main goals the necessity to make cities sustainable and resilient. The urban surfaces (i.e. streets, façades, roofs, etc.) are a key element in this process. Indeed, their exploitation offers the opportunity to increase resource efficiency, to produce renewable energy, to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to reduce the overall environmental impact of cities.
Urban planning plays an essential role in defining the allocation of surface uses and ensuring their integration. This paper proposes an analytical framework to support planning decisions about the types of surface use allowable, their extent and location. First, urban surfaces typologies and their major cluster of uses have been classified. For each cluster, a set of criteria has been identified to evaluate the technical viability of its application. Finally, a workflow has been designed for characterising the most suitable surface uses in consolidated urban areas. The application of the proposed approach, which has been tested in Bolzano (Italy), is able to support the implementation of integrated policies aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals in cities.
