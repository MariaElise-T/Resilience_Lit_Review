AbstractThis study aims to explore the interactions between the government, the tourism industry, universities, media, society, and the environment in the management and utilization of tourist villages in Bandung Regency, Indonesia. The research employed a qualitative-explorative method with a case study approach. Research analysis was assisted by the Nvivo 12 Plus qualitative analysis tool. The result's findings show that tourist villages require coordinated efforts from the government, tourism sector, universities, media, local communities, and the environment because in our opinion the environment/nature cannot only be viewed as an object but must rather be aligned with other important sectors in development programs. This connection may at the very least provide a means of enhancing the management of tourism villages and achieving sustainability and resilience. The contribution of this research provides insight into the process of developing creative tourism villages in realizing sustainability and resilience through tourism villages that pay attention to economic, social, infrastructure, and environmental dimensions.
