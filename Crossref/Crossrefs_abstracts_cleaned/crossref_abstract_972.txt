Abstract
Building coastal resilience can help communities prepare and adapt to climate change. While the impacts of climate change are not equitably distributed, a method has not been developed to measure how resilience plans address justice. This study developed a Just Resilience Index (JRI) to assess how justice themes were incorporated into resilience plans. The JRI examines how justice frameworks (recognitional, distributive, and procedural justice, community capability) were addressed within the resilience plans of 11 U.S. coastal cities. Justice was considered in 41% of the resilience plan actions. Fifty-two percent of the justice-related actions recognized the needs of low-income communities but only 3% recognized specific racial groups. Of the justice-related actions, 73% addressed distributive justice but procedural justice was least characterized within the plans (46%). The JRI can guide future planning efforts to ensure that justice frameworks are better integrated within resilience planning to reduce inequities from climate-related disasters.
