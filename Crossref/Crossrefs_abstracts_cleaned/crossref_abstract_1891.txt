 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to select and refine an integrated substance abuse and HIV prevention intervention model for rural African American adolescents based on input from teens, parents, pastors, and school officials. DESIGN: The study design was qualitative descriptive. Twenty-one adolescents and 17 adults participated in four focus groups. The adolescent groups consisted of 11 adolescents, ages 13 to 15 years, and 10 adolescents, ages 16 to 18 years. The two adult groups consisted of 7 and 8 participants, respectively. RESULTS: Adolescent and adult respondents discussed numerous risk and resiliency factors associated with adolescentsâ€™ potential drug use and sexual behavior. Overall, all groups identified more HIV-related factors than drug-use factors, whether risk or resiliency. Both adolescents and adults reported common factors, but the majority of factors were not held in common. Adolescents recommended a comprehensive prevention-intervention approach, which included condom use demonstration, whereas the adult approach lacked any reference to sex education. CONCLUSION: Adolescents and adults recognize the need to intervene early with rural African American teens to decrease their risk of engaging in sex and drug use. Although both acknowledge the existence of resiliency factors, the risk factors appear to outweigh the resiliency factors, especially at the community level.
