Subgrade soil is very important materials to support highways. Resilient modulus (MR) has been used for characterizing stress-strain behavior of base or subbase subjected to repeated traffic loadings. Several methods to estimate the resilient modulus were suggested in the past years. The main objective of this study was to test the resilient modulus in the laboratory. The Subgrade soil was selected in Henan province. Resilient modulus tests were conducted with UTM. Additional analysis was performed to discuss the factors of the test results.
