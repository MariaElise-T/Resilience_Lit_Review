This study was conducted as a descriptive study to determine the factors affecting the psychological endurance levels of the nurses. A questionnaire consisting of 21 questions and the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) were used for data collection in this study. It is a five-point Likert scale, consisting of 33 items. Percentage calculation, Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney U test were used for the assessment of the data. The average score of the nurses in the RSA was determined to be 123.3 ± 21.3. A statistically significant relationship has been found between some of the sociodemographic characteristics of the nurses and their score in the RSA (p < 0.05). As per the results, it has been determined that the nurses who are married, have kids, have bachelor’s degree or higher, love their jobs, satisfied with the department they work at and chose their departments of their own volition, have high levels of resilience.Keywords: Endurance, nurse, resilience
