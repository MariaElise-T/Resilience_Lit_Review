Abstract

Context:
Substance use affects the personal, social, and familial aspects of a person’s life and is usually persistent, chronic, and relapsing in nature. Self-efficacy and resilience are important in the process of recovery of these persons.


Aims:
The current study aimed to examine the abstinence self-efficacy and resilience of persons with substance use disorder.


Study Design:
The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional research design.


Materials and Methods:
Convenience sampling technique was used to select 60 patients in a tertiary mental health-care setting. The tools used were Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale and Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale.


Results:
The mean resilience was 76.52 ± 14.320 and the mean abstinence self-efficacy (confidence) was 57.50 ± 19.108. There was also a significant positive correlation between resilience and abstinence self-efficacy (confidence), r = 0.325, P = 0.011.


Conclusions:
The study findings indicate that patients with substance use disorder have moderate abstinence self-efficacy and resilience. Resilience and abstinence self-efficacy can be further enhanced in substance-using persons through proper interventions which will help to maintain long-term abstinence.
