 Understanding impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with cancer is important to inform care. Online survey of 16–24 year olds receiving cancer treatment at eight cancer centres in the UK. We measured: self-perceived increased anxiety since COVID-19, impact of COVID-19 on treatment, life and relationships, PHQ-8, GAD and the two-item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). 112 AYA participated. 59.8% had previous mental health difficulties. 78.6% reported COVID-19 having a significant impact on life. 79% reported experiencing increased anxiety since COVID-19.43.4% had moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores and 37.1% GADS-7 scores. Impact on life was associated with moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.65–16.56, p < 0.01), impact on relationships with moderate-severe GADS-7 and PHQ-8 score (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.11–7.54, p = 0,03; OR 3.54, 95% CI 2.32–15.17, p < 0.01; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11–5.25, p =0.03). Greater resilience was associated with lower mod-severe GADS-7and PHQ-8 scores (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41–0.81, p < 0.01; OR 0.55 95% CI 0.4–0.72, p < 0.01; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38–0.69, p < 0.01). We found high levels of psychological distress. Perceived impact of COVID-19 on relationships and life was predictive of poorer mental health, with resilience a protective factor.
