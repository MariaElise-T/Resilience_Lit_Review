Management science is primarily concerned with research related to and benefiting from the experience of business practice. Hence, the search for optimal solutions, often takes place on the 'living fabric' of organisations. The current situation is no different. On the one hand (in the face of geopolitical instability in Europe), we observe the fragility of organisations or hitherto applied solutions (acute disruptions: of supply chains - e.g., of highly processed goods; of services - e.g., related to global links in the banking system; or related to reorientation in the energy system). The need for rapid (often radical) change in the organisation proved to be a condition for its survival. On the other hand, we note a number of effects indicating the high competence of companies, operating mainly in highly developed economies (such as Europe), in terms of their flexibility and resilience to highly volatile disruptions (which are undoubtedly present in Europe). The search for effective ways/methods to increase organisations' level of preparedness for future crises and build its capacity to turn crises into opportunities has become more important than ever.
