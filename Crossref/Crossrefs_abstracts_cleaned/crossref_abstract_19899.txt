Abstract

AIM
This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a disaster nursing and management education program on beliefs in general disaster preparedness, disaster response self-efficacy, and psychological resilience in nursing students.


METHOD
The sample consisted of nursing students receiving undergraduate education in Istanbul, Turkey. Participants were randomly divided into the intervention (n = 65) and control (n = 66) groups. The intervention group was given an eight-module education program with theoretical and applied components. Data were collected using the Belief in General Disaster Preparedness Scale, the Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Brief Resilience Scale.


RESULTS
The mean Belief in General Disaster Preparedness Scale, Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale, and Brief Resilience Scale scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group.


CONCLUSION
The disaster nursing and management education program provided to nursing students was determined to increase beliefs in general disaster preparedness, disaster response self-efficacy, and psychological resilience.
