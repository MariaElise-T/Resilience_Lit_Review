 Child protection is a stressful occupation that can result in burnout and job exit for some social workers. This article will focus on the positive and negative impacts of co-worker and manager relationships, reporting on the meaning applied by workers, and on how these relationships impact their ability to manage the challenges of child protection work. Semi-structured interviews with 15 social-workers who left and 15 who stayed reveal the critical importance of relationships at work for either building resilience or contributing to burnout. Recommendations call for employer-level interventions to promote relationship-focused interventions to enhance social worker resilience.
