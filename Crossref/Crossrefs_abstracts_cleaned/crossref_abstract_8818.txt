Employee resilience is an aspect which has acquired more interest over the years. Resilience is considered a factor which enables employees to find resources to help them deal, respond productively, and adjust to stressful situations Employee resilience refers to the ability of the employees to bounce back to normalcy and be better after any disruption or disturbance at work. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, employees were affected. Their routine was disturbed, there was widespread confusion and they faced challenges in maintaining the work-life balance. Health issues were also on the rise with the changing pattern of life. The study looks into the employee resilience of 50 respondents from Kerala who work in various designations in different areas of work. Employee resilience is assessed using Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ) developed by Clarke and Nicholson in 2010. The scale has 12 items distributed across the Likert scale. The study also looks into the work-life balance of the employees and the factors contributing to work-life balance. Challenges faced during the lockdown while commuting to work were also looked into in the study. Employee resilience is an important aspect to be studied especially in times when the nature of work has gone through drastic changes. Enhancing the level of resilience of the employees can not only benefit the employee but also the organisation too.
