Purpose of review
Sarcoidosis is a multiorgan system disease exerting significant impact on biophysical, social, psychological and emotional well-being. Mortality and disability correlate to accessible, timely, expert care for sarcoidosis and its related complications. Across health conditions, positive healthcare interactions and interventions can rehabilitate unfavourable factors tied to concepts of ‘frailty’. Here, we set out to introduce concepts related to frailty and their impact in the context of sarcoidosis.


Recent findings
Studies examining frailty across other multiorgan and single organ-based diseases that mirror organ involvement in sarcoidosis demonstrate findings that bear relevance in sarcoidosis. Namely, factors predisposing a person to frailty are a multifactorial phenomenon which are also reflected in the lived experience of sarcoidosis; and that early diagnosis, intervention and prevention may alter a course towards more favourable health outcomes.


Summary
Factors predisposing to frailty in other health conditions may also signal a risk in sarcoidosis. In turn, proactive health preservation – regardless of age – may lead to improved biopsychosocial reserve and health-related quality of life. Fortifying holistic resilience in sarcoidosis is anticipated to reduce risk of the occurrence and prolongation of health-related complications, and facilitate swifter recovery from biophysical complications as well as from psychosocial and emotional stressors.
