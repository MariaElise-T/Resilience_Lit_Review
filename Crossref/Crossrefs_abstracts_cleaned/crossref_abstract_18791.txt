AbstractMilitary personnel experience training and operational demands that are different from civilian populations, including frequent deployment, exposure to austere environments, and dislocation from family. These unique occupational demands may result in negative impacts on health, performance, and career success. As such, resilience, defined as a system's capacity to resist, recover, recover better, or adapt, to perturbation from a challenge or stressor, is a critical factor in assuring the health and safety of military personnel. In recent years, the Department of Defense (DoD) has funded research programs assessing the physiological basis of resilience. This review will overview research programs, review salient findings from recent studies, and highlight potential future areas of research. Physiological factors influencing or predicting resilience in US military populations, including physical performance, anthropometrics and body composition, nutrition and dietary supplements, and other biomarkers will be highlighted. Finally, this manuscript will detail potential future studies, including interventions, aimed at optimising physiological resilience in military personnel.
