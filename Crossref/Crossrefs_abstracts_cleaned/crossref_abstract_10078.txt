AbstractThis paper focuses on the exponential stability and the resilient state feedback controller design for large‐scale networked control systems under denial‐of‐service attacks. The duration of each denial‐of‐service attack is captured by a logical processor embedded in the controller. The closed‐loop system of periodic sampled‐data control is modelled as an aperiodic sampled‐data control system associated with lower and upper bounds on the duration of the denial‐of‐service attack. Two formal results are demonstrated. The first result is the stability criterion for large‐scale networked control systems under denial‐of‐service attacks obtained by constructing a two‐sided mode‐dependent loop‐based Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional under the action of a prediction‐based controller. The second result presents a criterion based on linear matrix inequalities to design the controller against denial‐of‐service attacks. In particular, iterative algorithms are given for computing the allowable delay upper bound for the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the interconnected power systems of the two areas.
