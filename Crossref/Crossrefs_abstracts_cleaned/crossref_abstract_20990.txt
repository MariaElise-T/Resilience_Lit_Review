AbstractPurposeTo evaluate the effect of experimental (Ricinus communis) and commercial dentifrices used for denture cleaning on abrasiveness (gravimetric method; roughness), hardness, and color stability of a resilient relining material.Materials and MethodsSixty circular (15 × 3 mm) specimens were distributed into four groups: C (control; brushing with water); CO (brushing with Colgate – for natural teeth); CB (brushing with Corega Brite – for complete dentures); RC (brushing with experimental dentifrice). Brushing was performed in a toothbrushing machine with a soft brush and a dentifrice suspension for 50 minutes, calculated to correspond to 1 year of regular brushing. Variables were measured initially and after the trial period. For the gravimetric method, the difference in mass was considered. The surface roughness was measured by a rugosimeter, and the hardness test was performed by a Shore A durometer. Color changes (ΔE; CIE L*a*b* and NBS systems) were measured by a portable spectrophotometer. Results were analyzed by ANOVA/Tukey's test (α = 0.05).ResultsThe largest mass variation (μg; p < 0.0001) occurred in C (–6.21 ± 3.18). Concerning roughness, CB (0.26 ± 0.04) showed the lowest value, followed by RC (0.29 ± 0.08) and CO (0.34 ± 0.24) (p < 0.0001). Group C produced the greatest surface roughness (0.72 ± 0.25). Hardness values decreased after brushing with water (p = 0.014). No significant differences were found among RC (50.31 ± 1.03), CO (49.11 ± 1.31), CB (49.17 ± 1.23), and C (48.02 ± 1.26). Color stability was similar in all groups (p = 0.135; C: 2.3 ± 0.77; CO: 2.6 ± 0.54; CB: 2.2 ± 0.44; RC: 2.9 ± 1.56).ConclusionsThe use of experimental dentifrice could be indicated, as it showed similar results to the specific dentifrice, keeping the resilient material properties within acceptable values.
