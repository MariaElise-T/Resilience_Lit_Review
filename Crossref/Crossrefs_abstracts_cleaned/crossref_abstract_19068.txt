AbstractBackgroundThe psychosocial outcomes of young adult survivors of childhood bone tumors are not well known. This study: (a) examined perceived social support (SS) and benefit‐finding (BF) with respect to surgical intervention, gender, and age; (b) compared SS and psychological outcomes to normative values; and (c) examined the relationship between these social and psychological outcomes and sexual functioning. ProcedureTwenty‐eight participants (18–32 years) completed outcome‐specific questionnaires for SS, BF, depression, self‐worth, and sexual functioning. Surgical intervention was grouped into limb sparing (LS; allograft‐fusion and endoprosthesis) and ablative procedures (AMP; amputation or Van Nes rotationplasty). Age at study was grouped into ≤25 or ≥26 years of age.ResultsCompared to normative values, survivors reported significantly less depressive symptoms (P = 0.005), and higher self‐evaluations of intellectual capabilities (P = 0.009). No significant differences in SS and BF were found between surgical and age groups. Males perceived significantly higher SS than females (P = 0.027). Significant positive correlations were found between perceived SS and sexual functioning (r = 0.397), sexual experiences (r = 0.423), and satisfaction with sexual relationships (r = 0.408). Negative correlation was found between global SS and depression scores (r = −0.397). Similar correlations were found with the subscales of the SS, depression, and self‐worth measures. BF was significantly positively correlated only to SS (r = 0.552).ConclusionsBone tumor survivors, particularly males, demonstrated remarkable psychosocial resiliency with SS possibly serving as a protective factor for survivors' psychological and sexual functioning.
