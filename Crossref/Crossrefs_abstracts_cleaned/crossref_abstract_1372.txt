Nurse Leaders managing hospitals and healthcare facilities are challenged with their traditional inherits of caring and resiliency. Their nursing philosophy of caring and resiliency tested their leadership abilities and the scope of their governance in managing their clinical units. Nurses are becoming sick and resulting positive with rapid test kits on the disease. Others are resigning from their posts to protect their families and significant others. The nursing shortage is becoming evident and being felt by nurse leaders. Their leadership and governance were caught unaware of the existence of these global disease outbreaks, leading to countless works and untiring delivery of holistic care among patients with COVID-19 cases. As regards, the paper focuses on the construct of emerging theory in caring and resiliency among nurse leaders holding the highest position in the nursing service, meeting a lot of challenges in the new normal of their praxis on nursing management during the pandemic crisis. As front-liners in the healthcare system experiencing a pandemic crisis, fear, anxiety, and their psychological well-being are at risk while burnout and compassion fatigue are at stake to be observed. It is high time for nurse leaders to revisit their leadership and management programs to ensure that they are creating a cross-cultural environment where nurses foster holistic caring and resiliency.
