 Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the modified 25-item Resilience Scale (RS-25) in older adults post-hip fracture using Rasch analysis. Methods: This was a descriptive study using baseline data from the Seventh Baltimore Hip Studies (BHS-7). There were 339 hip fracture patients included in this analysis. Results: Findings suggest there was support for reliability of the measure based on person and item separation index. The INFIT and OUTFIT statistics for testing validity were all in the acceptable range indicating that each item on the modified RS-25 fits the appropriate concept. There was no evidence of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) between genders. Conclusions: This study demonstrated evidence that the modified RS-25 is a reliable and valid measure to evaluate resilience among older adults post-hip fracture and therefore can be used in this population in clinical practice and research.
