This research mainly focuses on two purposes, the first of which is to examine the relationship between the resilience levels of 5-6-year-old preschool children, their temperament, and their ages. The second purpose of the research is to determine the opinions of their teachers on resilience and resilient children, the risk factors that affect the resilience and the protective factors. Accordingly, the mixed- method design was used in the study. The sample in the quantitative part of the study consisted of the parents and teachers of the 151 children enrolled in preschool education under the Usak Provincial Directorate for National Education. Qualitative data were collected from the interviews with 15 preschool teachers. The quantitative data were collected using the "Early Childhood Resilience Scale" and "The Short Temperament Scale for Children". The qualitative data were collected using the "Semi-structured Interview Form” which consists of 4 questions regarding the 15 preschool teachers’ opinions on resilience. According to the results, the age and temperament (i.e., persistence and reactivity) were found to be significant predictors of resilience. It was also found that the resilience scores of the children increased with age. The qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive and content analysis methods. The teachers expressed the highest rate of resilience as “being able to struggle”, while the characteristics of the children, who have resilience behaviour, were described as “being determined”. They expressed the concept of “domestic violence” as a risk factor that may influence resilience, and “personality traits” as the protective factor.
