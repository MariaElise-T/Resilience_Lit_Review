The equations of motion of a rigid body supported by an arbitrary number of arbitrarily oriented and located resilient mounts with damping are developed with rigor. Their solution is given in a form suitable for high-speed electonic digital computer programing and includes prediction of natural frequencies, static displacements and load distribution to the mounts due to static loading, and frequency response curves for a given isolation system. IBM 704 EDPM and 709 EDPS Fortran computational programs will be supplied on request. An appendix is also included for transforming the inertial properties of a rigid body to a desired frame of reference.
