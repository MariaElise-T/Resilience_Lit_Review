This study explores present-day knowledge of chemical weapon attacks amongst the Yezidi population of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which remains at risk of attack. The scope of the research covers the Anfal campaigns, the use of chemical weapons during the Syrian civil war, and chemical attacks launched by so-called Islamic State (IS). The authors conducted a series of qualitative interviews (10) and surveys (20), across a wide social sample (gender, age, education, profession) – speaking to victims of chemical weapon attacks as well as those with no experience of them. Information was gathered on public awareness and current security concerns, particularly considering the role of memory. This research may be utilised to enhance access to information, education, and emergency response – in order to increase resilience and preparedness amongst the vulnerable Yezidi community. The authors hope to contribute to the conference objectives to enrich dialogues, improve curricula, and work toward establishing an Early Warning Centre.
