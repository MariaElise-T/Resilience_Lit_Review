SummaryTo validate the Pain Resilience Scale (PRS) for use in Chinese patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) pain. According to international guidelines, the original PRS was first translated and cross‐culturally adapted to formulate the Chinese version of PRS (PRS‐C). A total of 152 patients with TMD pain were recruited to complete series of questionnaires. Reliability of the PRS‐C was investigated using internal consistency and test‐retest reliability. Validity of the PRS‐C was calculated using cross‐cultural validity and convergent validity. Cross‐cultural validity was evaluated by examining the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). And convergent validity was examined through correlating the PRS‐C scores with scores of 2 commonly used pain‐related measures (the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale [CD‐RISC] and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia for Temporomandibular Disorders [TSK‐TMD]). The PRS‐C had a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and good test‐retest reliability (intra‐class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.81). The CFA supported a 2‐factor model for the PRS‐C with acceptable fit to the data. The fit indices were chi‐square/DF = 2.21, GFI = 0.91, TLI = 0.97, CFI = 0.98 and RMSEA = 0.08. As regards convergent validity, the PRS‐C evidenced moderate‐to‐good relationships with the CD‐RISC and the TSK‐TMD. The PRS‐C shows good psychometric properties and could be considered as a reliable and valid measure to evaluate pain‐related resilience in patients with TMD pain.
