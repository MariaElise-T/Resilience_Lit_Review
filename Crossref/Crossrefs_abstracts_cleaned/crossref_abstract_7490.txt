PurposeThe purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effect of employee well-being on the relationship between a bundle of human resource practices (HR practices) and employee resilience among Thai employees in an insurance company.Design/methodology/approachSelf-report questionnaires were received from 317 employees. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, followed by structural equation model (SEM) to test all hypotheses.FindingsA partial mediator role of employee well-being on the relationship was detected, highlighting the significant consequences of a bundle of HR practices during the recent pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThe study's limitations were its self-report questionnaires and cross-sectional design.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the importance of a bundle of HR practices under the unusual situation, i.e. during the data collection process, telecommuting was implemented in the organization to comply with the government regulations. A bundle of HR practices can be perceived as resources that can help individual employees overcome this challenging situation, which supports organizational performance.Originality/valueHigh environmental uncertainty requires today's organizations to be aware of the importance of employee resilience since this can contribute to organizational resilience. Additionally, employees rank their well-being as one of the top factors they seek from an organization. Thus, this study empirically extended the benefits of a bundle of HR practices in the context of COVID-19, supporting the mutual gains model.
