This paper aims at expressing the manner in which the Ministry of National Defence (MoND) can benefit from direct support, efficient and significant financial support for the implementation of sustainable reforms and public investments, as provided in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).The situation triggered by COVID-19 brings about new awareness in Romania and among all the EU member states, through the economic-financial crisis, jobs crisis, health, education, research, innovation and digitalization crisis, which has an impact on the drop of revenues both at European and international level. We must agree that such pandemics should find us prepared and that the investments should be planned well beforehand, similarly to the creation of an army. The defence of a state requires costs, and the financial support allocated to the defence sector is visible in the results of the foreign and economic policy of Romania. From this perspective, the MoND has prepared a series of proposals included in a number of reforms and investments documents. Such reforms and investments are absolutely necessary to Romania and represent essential contributions to the NRRP.
