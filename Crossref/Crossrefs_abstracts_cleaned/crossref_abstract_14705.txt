AbstractThe goal of the report is to provide information and define activities for local planners who want to build resilience in their communities. This audience, including community leaders from both governmental and non‐governmental organizations, is then provided with what the authors describe as a roadmap. This roadmap consists of identifying and strengthening eight “levers,” each associated with specific “elements” and “activities.” The levers in turn address four “core components” of community resilience.
