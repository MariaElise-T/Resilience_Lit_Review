AbstractAmmonia is one of the most widely used chemicals in the processing industry. It is used as a refrigerant and substrate in various process fields. Almost every unit operation uses ammonia, and the storage and handling of ammonia require special attention in terms of inherent system safety. Controlling the catastrophic release of ammonia from the installed facility is a challenging process. In this paper, the resilient nature of the ammonia storage area in a fertilizer manufacturing plant in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent was considered. The resilience of the ammonia storage area is analyzed using the Resilience‐based Integrated Process System Hazard Analysis and statistically validated using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA). With the ANOVA validation method, the f‐values of subsystems are endorsed at a significance level of 0.05 both before and after recommendations were made. After implementing the statistically validated recommendations, the risk of each subsystem is significantly reduced. It has been determined that subsystems, namely process safety systems, operator/human hazards, and operational discipline require, immediate attention.
