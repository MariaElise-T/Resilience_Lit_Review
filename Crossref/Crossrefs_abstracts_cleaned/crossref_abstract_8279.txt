Trees, forests and agroforestry (TFA) are key assets in the socio-economic life of farmers. They are crucial resources for farmers’ resilience (exante and expost) to shocks. This paper investigates the potential for farmer’s resilience through the national reforestation project “Ewe Burundi Urambaye” in Burundi. The survey was carried out in four of the country’s provinces during 2022. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups with project coordinators and local communities. Field observation and secondary data complemented the data collection. The reforestation of bare state-owned areas demonstrates a strong potential for restoring the ecosystem and biodiversity (flora and fauna), with positive spin-offs in terms of improving farmers’ well-being and resilience. The agroforestry practised is a significant element in income diversification. Participative governance involving all stakeholders is a key to the success of this project in addition to the weeding planted trees and in the education/training of farmers. Investment in the purchase of drones and training of drone users is an added value in the monitoring and evaluation of the project.
