AbstractKalisch et al. propose a positive appraisal style as the key mechanism that underlies resilience. The present authors suggest that flexibility in emotion processing is more conducive to resilience than a general positivity bias. People may achieve emotional flexibility through counter-regulation â€“ a dynamic processing bias toward positive stimuli in negative contexts and negative stimuli in positive contexts.
