Abstract
During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic evaluation of capabilities, and multisector coordination are challenging while operating in triage mode. During Action Review and Tabletop (DART) identifies recommendations for strengthening readiness and resiliency by creating a single methodology integrating retrospective analysis of the response to date with a prospective analysis of future scenarios. DART utilizes a role-based questionnaire and participant-led discussion for retrospective response review and identification of future scenarios of concern. Tabletop exercises exploring those future scenarios are conducted in a multi-role format to assess readiness and resiliency. Participants evaluate findings to determine recommended actions to improve response capabilities. 3 COVID-19 focused DARTs demonstrated the ability of this participant-led approach to systematically assess, not only readiness for today, but also resiliency to future complications. While demonstrating its usefulness during COVID-19, DARTâ€™s flexible and modular design promises to be an effective for any ongoing health emergency.
