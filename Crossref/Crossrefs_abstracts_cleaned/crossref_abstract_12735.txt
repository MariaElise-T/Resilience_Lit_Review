 Transportation agencies own tens of thousands of assets, providing essential mobility and economic services to the communities they serve. Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century and subsequent legislation require asset managers to implement risk-based asset management. A discussion is presented on the application of one quantitatively based framework—the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Innovative Technology Institute's Risk and Resilience Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection—for analyzing risks posed by physical threats to highway transportation systems and assets. The application of this particular risk analysis framework by the Colorado Department of Transportation following the 2013 floods is recounted; the analysis was used to support requests for federal emergency response funding. Finally, the potential benefits of such analysis for highway transportation project planning and strategic planning are also examined.
