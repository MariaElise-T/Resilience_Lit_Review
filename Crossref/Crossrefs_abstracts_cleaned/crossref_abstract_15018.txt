Abstract
Global climate change causes the occurrence of natural disasters like floods. Disaster causes a loss or other negative impacts on the community. Community resilience is necessary to increase the capability to cope with the negative impacts. Besides the local wisdom, many aspects should be improved to reduce the disaster risk. This study aimed to determine the level of community resilience facing floods in Kampung Sewu and to find out the variables that cause the level of resilience of Kampung Sewu community low. This research was conducted in Kampung Sewu, Jebres Subdistrict, Surakarta City, precisely in Neigborhood Association (RT) and Citizenz Association (RW), namely: RT 02/RW I, RT 03/RW I, RT 01/RW II, RT 02/RW II, RT 01/RW II, RT 01/RW IV, RT 01/RW VIII and RT 01/RW IX. The method used in this research was descriptive quantitative. The analysis used was Climate and Disaster Resilience Initiative (CDRI). The sampling technique was purposive sampling. The results of this study indicated that the area that had the highest level of community resilience was RT03/RW I because the location had low risk and rare from intervention of Sibat Community to anticipate of flooding. Location that had the lowest resistance level was RT01/RW IX because the location had never been flooded and there was no interference in Sibat Sewu in anticipation of flooding. Sibat Sewu educates people actively improving capacity building for community in Kampung Sewu.
