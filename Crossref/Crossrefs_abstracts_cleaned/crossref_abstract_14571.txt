Abstract
The limited resilience of agricultural and food systems has become an agenda in the time of more extreme natural hazards. The impact of such events is extensive, and the level of damage and recovery strongly depends on ecosystem services, including their own resilience capacity. Most of the time, ecosystems themselves can offer mitigation measures based on the benefits people get from nature, including cultivated and wild biomass for nutrition, materials, or energy; pest and disease control; and regulation of baseline flows, among others. The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, addressed issues related to crop production, food security, and nutrition. The information garnered from this conference provided impetus for actions that we believe can ensure a future with the resources needed for sustainable development and that support the health and nutrition for all the inhabitants on Earth.
