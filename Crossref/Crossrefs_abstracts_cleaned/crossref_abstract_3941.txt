Abstract
The resilience of rubber is usually measured by a rebound test, and an accurate instrument for this purpose is the rebound pendulum. This instrument consists of a compound pendulum with a steel ball, fixed at the center of percussion, which strikes a rubber sample held in a suitable holder. The pendulum is released from a known angle, and the rebound angle is measured. The ratio of energy of rebound to energy of fall is the resilience value of the rubber. The distance the ball indents the rubber also can be measured, and under certain defined conditions can be used to determine the hardness of the rubber. An account of the pendulum used by the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., is given by Jones and Pearce, and descriptions of similar instruments derived from the Fort Dunlop pendulum and used by American manufacturers are given in various publications. The instrument is capable of a high degree of accuracy, and angles can be read to 3 minutes of arc or less, giving a maximum error due to this cause on one reading of 1 part in 500. The purpose of this paper is to describe certain refinements in the technique of using the pendulum to improve the precision of the instrument. It is essential that the mechanical construction of the instrument, particularly the rigidity of the pendulum and its supporting column and the location of the striking ball at the center of percussion, shall be precise.
