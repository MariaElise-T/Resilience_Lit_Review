AbstractDisruptions to key lifelines, especially electrical power, can cause outsized impacts on human functioning. The state of the art on developed countries has focused on enhancing resilience to electrical grid infrastructure but has neglected to track changes regarding how the private market has developed electricity continuity measures over time. Backup generators are among the most accessible tools to maintain electricity continuity in case of power failure, but their role as a buffer remains understudied outside the technical domain, along with the humanitarian and emergency response sectors.This paper analyzes generator sales across the U.S. to understand some underlying trends that may have influenced changes in consumer preference for electricity resilience. Reports from major backup generator sellers and import data of backup generators reveal an increase in backup generators across the U.S. and find that private demand for energy resilience is likely increasing due to consumersâ€™ perceived risk and rising levels of intolerance to power disruptions. The discussion finds that an increase in private demand and use of backup generators may be impacting electricity resilience at a communal and societal level, which seems to be underexamined by studies focusing on private generator usage in the U.S..
