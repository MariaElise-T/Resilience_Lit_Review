The anthropogenic disturbance caused by irrational urbanization impacts the ecological security of cities. The study of the relationship between urban spatial form (USF) and urban ecological resilience (UER) can offer guidance for sustainable urban development. We select the UER evaluation indexes and construct a DRSIR model based on the causal relationship among the natural, social, and economic dimensions of cities. We also carried out empirical research on the impact of USF on UER in the city cluster located in the Yangtze River midstream (YRM) through the geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) model and geographical detector for four time cross-sections: 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The following findings were obtained: (1) The computing results for UERIs of cities in the YRM noticeably and consistently increased during the study period, exhibiting a spatial distribution pattern with high values in the southeast, second-highest in the northwest, and low values in the center. (2) The regression coefficients of USFIs and UERIs displayed significant spatial and temporal variations in the YRM during the study period. (3) CA, AWMPFD, PD, and AI showed a positive correlation with UERIs, while PD exhibited a negative correlation with UERIs. (4) LPI and AI emerged as the primary drivers of spatial heterogeneity in UERIs, and the interaction between these two factors significantly enhanced their impact on UERIs compared to individual influencing factors. Exploring the correlation between UER and USF can be utilized to provide urban management recommendations that are suitable for the level of urban development, which will contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the YRM.
