In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), each sensor node is proficient to transmit data packets dynamically deprived of any constraint of fixed infrastructure. Sensor nodes (SNs) intermittently travels within the network from one cluster to another, which makes the network topology unsteady, uncertain, and unreliable. Consequently, it turns to be an immense challenge to sustain network stability and durability. In this work, the authors have presented a resilient steady clustering technique (RSCT) that will maintain durability and steadiness to the sensor network by reducing the unnecessary and avoidable cluster head (CH) changes and minimizing clustering and networking overheads. In the presented technique, they have introduced a new SN that acts as a standby node (SBN) in the cluster. This SBN performs the tasks of CH whenever the actual CH moves from the cluster. Later the CH re-elect the new SBN. This process keeps the network available and serviceable without any interruption. The decision for selecting the CH and SBN depends on the optimal CH threshold function and an energy threshold function.
