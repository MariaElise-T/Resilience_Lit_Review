 COVID-19 greatly impacted nursing education and required nursing faculty and students to quickly adapt to changes caused by disease mitigation. The purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effects of resilience between the influence of demographics and school-related risk factors and nursing faculty and student quality of life (QoL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling to examine the mediating role of resilience on latent variables. Resilience had a positive, direct effect on nursing faculty and student QoL. Having a designated home workspace and being well-prepared for online learning had positive, indirect effects on QoL, mediated through resilience. Assisting children with schoolwork had a negative impact on the psychological and environmental QoL domains. Remarkably, having a caregiver role positively influenced the psychological QoL domain. Supporting and promoting faculty and nursing studentsâ€™ health and well-being is imperative during and after the pandemic.
