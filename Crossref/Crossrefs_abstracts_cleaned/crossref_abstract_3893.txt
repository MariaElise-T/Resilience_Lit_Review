In this paper, the author advocates for a psychosocial and community perspective in the work with child soldiers, as torture survivors.
Healing is a priority for former child soldiers, many of whom have survived mass exposures to violence, perpetrated violence, or both. Reintegration programming is often limited by individualized treatment and deficits focused approaches that do not address powerful social barriers to reintegration such as stigma and not having a positive social role. This paper outlines a more holistic, relational approach to reintegration that addresses clinical maladies but also addresses the need for positive social relationships that support young people's resilience and well-being. Underscoring the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach, it calls for the integration of livelihoods supports with mental health and psychosocial supports.
