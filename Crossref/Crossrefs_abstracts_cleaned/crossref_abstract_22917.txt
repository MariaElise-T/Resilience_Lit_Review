Abstract
Party-n-Play (PNP) refers to sex between gay and bisexual men that occurs under the influence of drugs. Growing evidence suggests gay and bisexual men who PNP experience significant stigma and social exclusion. Less is known about the resilience of this population. Utilising critical discourse analysis, this study examined how gay and bisexual men who PNP talk about social exclusion and resilience in their lives. In-depth one-hour interviews were conducted with forty-four gay and bisexual men who lived in Toronto, and who used various drugs before or during sex with another man in the previous month. Study findings revealed that social exclusion was perpetuated through discourses of stigma, deviance, morality, heteronormativity, homophobia, racism, classism, risk and policing. These discourses also negatively affected participantsâ€™ interactions with health care providers. However, many participants evoked resilience discourses and described social bonds, friendships and relations of care in their networks. Social work professionals would benefit from examining the roles of social exclusion, as well as stigmatising and pathologising discourses in their practice. These findings also underscore the need for culturally sensitive social work interventions for this population that address social exclusion and foster resilience.
