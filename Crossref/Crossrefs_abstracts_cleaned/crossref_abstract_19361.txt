They need many adaptations such as psychological self-acceptance, adaptation to the use of assistive devices, social adaptation, and economic adaptation. A person can adapt well if he has high resilience in himself.


AIM: The objective of the study was to explore the experiences of victims of natural disasters in Palu and Sigi who experienced physical disabilities in achieving resilience.

The total number of participants in this study was eight participants who were victims of natural disasters in Palu and Sigi and experienced physical disabilities and had achieved resilience based on the resilience scale.


RESULTS: The study found four main themes that explain why participants can achieve resilience, namely, sincerely accept reality, have a high fighting spirit, family and community become the support system, and make limitations as strengths.
