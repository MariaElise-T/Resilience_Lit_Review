 This paper deals with cities’ transformation from the perspectives of smartness, sustainability, and resilience, to stress the contribution of private firms. Indeed, technology providers globally have been observed as being partners of local authorities, mainly with reference to service platforms. To accomplish this aim, we reviewed the literature, considering the most relevant contributions on the themes, to establish an analytical framework; further on, we discussed 15 illustrative case studies — from a wider list — of firms involved in smart, sustainable, and resilient initiatives. The paper offers an analytical framework to merge, consisting of the five key features of smart, sustainable, and resilient cities, and leads to opportunities to further investigate the contribution of firms to cities’ transformation in a new way that embeds multiple perspectives.
