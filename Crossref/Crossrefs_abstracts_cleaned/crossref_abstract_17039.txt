 Purpose of Study: Though nursing burnout is a global problem, research on nurse burnout in Haiti is scarce. In a context of multiple personal, social, and environmental challenges, this study assessed burnout and associated factors among Haitian nurses. Design of Study: A multi-site cross-sectional study. Methods: A survey in French and Haitian Creole was conducted in five Haitian hospitals using forward and back translated scales measuring burnout (emotional exhaustion [EE], depersonalization [DP], personal accomplishment [PA]), self-efficacy, nursing work environment, resilience, and demographics. Findings: Haitian nurses ( N = 179) self-reported moderate EE ( M = 21, SD = 11.18), low DP ( Mdn = 2.0, range = 29), and high personal accomplishment ( Mdn = 41.0, range = 33). General self-efficacy ( M = 32.31, SD = 4.27) and resilience ( M = 26.68, SD = 5.86) were high. Dissatisfaction with salary, autonomy, and staffing were evident. Conclusions: It is noteworthy that burnout was lower than expected given the scarce resource, difficult socio-politico-economic environment. High levels of self-efficacy and resilience likely mitigated a higher level of burnout. Adaptation enables these nurses to manage their critical conditions and practice holistic nursing, which may inspire hope among nurses in similar contexts.
