Resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. A resilient health system is one that is capable to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to system-related shocks and stress, so as to bring sustained improvements in population health, despite the unstable circumstances. Nowadays, the emergency department (ED) of hospitals faces growing demands, rising acuteness and longer waiting times. An efficient, accurate and resilient triage system to improve the operation of the ED becomes crucial. In this work, a resilient system for automatic priority, sorting and monitoring of medical events -triage system- is developed, so that the patients in the ED are treated according to the severity of their condition and not by the order of attendance utilizing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that aggregates, processes patientsâ€™ vital signs as well as determines their Health Status (HS), according to which the ED staff performs the appropriate classification.
