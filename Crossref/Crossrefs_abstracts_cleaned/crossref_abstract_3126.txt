The emergence of Coronavirus herein referred to as COVID-19 shut down schools globally for a while. The closure of schools negatively impacted educational systems that had not developed a resilient or alternative model of instructional delivery such as the Cameroon Ministry of Basic Education. Tentative measures were taken to ensure the continuous delivery of teaching while hoping to build a resilient model of education that can guarantee continuous learning in times of emergencies. With the desire to develop an e-learning platform, the following research question: What are the factors that will foster the use of e-Learning Among Primary School Teachers in Cameroon? To respond to the research question, survey research design methodology was employed targeting n = 378 primary school teachers. The collected data was analysed using Pearson r correlation to examine the direct relationship between two variables. The findings revealed a positive relationship between the variables: relative advantage; compatibility; trialability; observability and attitude towards behaviour intention to use the e-learning platform. The relationship between attitude and behaviour intention was the strongest. An indication that attitude is a strong predictor of behaviour intention. It was concluded that relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and observability were predictors of teachersâ€™ attitude towards a behaviour intention to adopt the e-learning platform. On the other hand, the relationship between complexity and attitude was negative indicating that teachers perceive the e-learning platform as complex. It was recommended that teachers should be: thoroughly sensitised on the advantages of adopting the e-learning platform to innovate teaching and learning; and provided with the opportunity to experiment with the platform before it is finally rollout.
