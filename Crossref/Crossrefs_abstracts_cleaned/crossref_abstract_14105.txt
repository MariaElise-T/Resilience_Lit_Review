The COVID-19 pandemic and the need to put population into lockdown require a reflection on the capacity of homes to adjust to a specific function for which they are not designed: ensuring the health and wellbeing of people during lockdown periods. Thus, the government in the Comunitat Valenciana promoted a study to evaluate house suitability in this Spanish region through the Valencia Institute of Building. The information was obtained by directly asking people affected through an online survey. On the basis of a series of indicators proposed in the study, the level of resilience and measures that favour house adaptation to such an extreme situation are analysed. The ultimate purpose is to offer solutions to enhance house behaviour against similar risks. The information obtained will be further useful for regional regulations of house design to be amended, currently under revision.
