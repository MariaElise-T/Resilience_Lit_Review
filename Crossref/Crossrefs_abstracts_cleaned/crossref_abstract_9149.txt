Purpose:This article outlines a small-scale exploratory study focusing upon the impact of a brief coaching intervention on participant levels of resilience in the face of organisational change. The study sought to pilot a brief, three-session resilience coaching programme and explore the impact upon participants’ reported levels of resilience and attitudes towards organisational change.Design:A programme of three 90-minute coaching sessions was delivered at three-weekly intervals over a six-week period. Luthans et al. (2007) Psychological Capital (Psycap) Questionnaire and questions relating to participants’ confidence in dealing with organisational change were administered in a test/re-test design one week prior to the commencement of coaching and within two weeks of coaching conclusion.Method:An opportunity sample of 12 middle managers from a UK public sector organisation experiencing significant organisational change participated in the study. Participants completed the pre-coaching questionnaire and participated in a brief resilience coaching programme consisting of three semi-structured sessions. The coaching programme was designed to support individuals in developing and demonstrating resilient behaviours in the face of organisational changes and progressing their well-being and/or resilience related goals. Participants were invited to repeat the study questionnaire within two weeks of their final coaching session.Results:Statistical analyses supported both study questions, with participants reporting significant (positive) changes in resilience levels and confidence in dealing with organisational change following the coaching programme. Increases in participants’ psychological capital in the areas of ‘Hope’ and ‘Optimism’ were also found although ‘Self-Efficacy’ was not found to be significantly enhanced.
