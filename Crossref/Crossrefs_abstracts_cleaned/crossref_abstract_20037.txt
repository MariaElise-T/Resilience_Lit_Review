Introduction. The study of the phenomenon of resilience as the individual's ability to recover is extremely relevant due to the full-scale war, which causes chronic stress, emotional and physical trauma, etc. That is why psychologists face the need for a deep and detailed study of the features of resilience as an important ability to recover after stressful and traumatic events.  Aim: to adapt the «Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR)» (Fang-Wen Hu, Cheng-Han Lin, Fang-RuYueh, Yu-Tai Lo & Chung-Ying Lin) to the Ukrainian sample, to check the instrument statements' reliability and discrimination as well as to carry out validation and standardization of its scales on the Ukrainian sample.  Methods. To check the instrument's convergent validity, standardized the following questionnaires were used: «Personal Resources» (O.V. Savchenko, S.A. Sukach); «Conor-Davidson Stress Resistance Scale (CD-RISC-10)» (adapted by N.V. Shkolina, I.I. Shapoval, I.V. Orlova, I.O. Kedyk, and M.A. Stanislavchuk); «Learned Resourcefulness» (adapted by B.V. Biron).  Results: The «Physical Resilience Instrument for Older Adults (PRIFOR)» by Fang-Wen Hu, Cheng-HanLin, Fang-Ru Yueh, Yu-Tai Lo & Chung-Ying Lin" was successfully adapted to the Ukrainian sample and standardized, as well as the test norms were developed, which makes it possible to use the Instrument for the analysis of the general index and individual scales of individuals' resilience.  Conclusions. The Ukrainian version of the «Instrument for the Study of Resilience (IDR-14)» can be helpful for psychological assessment of and planning of work with military personnel and individuals who need recovery after stress, illness and mental and physical injuries.
