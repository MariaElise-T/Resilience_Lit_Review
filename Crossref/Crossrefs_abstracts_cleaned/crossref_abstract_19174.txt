The quality of information is crucial to the success of asset delivery, management, and performance in the Digitised Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (DAECO) sector. The exposure and sensitivity of information to threats during its lifecycle leaves it vulnerable, affecting the intrinsic, relational, and security dimensions of information quality. A resilient information lifecycle perspective that identifies capabilities and requirements is therefore needed to assure information quality amid threats. This research develops and presents an information resilience (IR) framework by drawing on the theories of resilience, information quality, and vulnerability. In developing the framework, the critical incident technique was employed in interviewing 30 professionals (average of 40 minutes) in addition to reviewing seven project-documents across three digitally-driven infrastructure projects (making up 324 pages of data). The validated capabilities and requirements identified from this study have been collated into the framework and this highlights the need for cognitive-driven capabilities and process-driven requirements in DAECO.
