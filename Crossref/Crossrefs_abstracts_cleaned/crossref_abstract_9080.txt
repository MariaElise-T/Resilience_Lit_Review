The planned research pursued two objectives. The first goal was to determine whether the selected variables: resilience and communication with peers, show a relationship with stress coping. The second  to predict, based on selected variables, the coping with stress by adolescents divided by their age. Research conducted using the Adolescent Communicationwith Peers Scale (SKAR), the Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-18) and the Coping Questionnaire in Stressful Situations (CISS) on a group of 546 adolescents divided into younger 1416 years of age. (37%) and older aged 1719 (63%) showed that the age of adolescents plays an important role in coping with stress. Among the predictors conducive to copingwith stress in the examined people, both in younger and older adolescents, there is openness in communication with peers. The sense of humour and openness to new experiences (dimension of resilience) showed a positive relationship in both the younger and the older group of adolescents. The general conclusion of the research is that mental resilience andopenness in peer relationships are conducive to undertaking task-oriented strategies of coping with stress by both younger and older adolescents.
