Abstract
The Semarang coastal areas face water and sediment-related disasters such as floods, land subsidence, and erosion that threaten its communities’ livelihood and undermine the environment’s coastal resources and quality. Likewise, the lack of adequate infrastructure and facilities makes the coastal area included as a slum area. Hence, living in slum settlements and facing water-related disasters makes people more vulnerable and difficult to face disasters. Therefore, this study focuses on assessing the physical quality of settlements as part of physical capital that reduces vulnerability and increases the community’s adaptive capacity to overcome adversities. The study adopted a quantitative approach through the scoring and descriptive comparative analysis by comparing each resilient settlement’s physical condition based on the indicator set.
