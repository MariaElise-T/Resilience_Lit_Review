Recently, frequent earthquakes have damaged bridge structures, causing great inconvenience owing to the disruption of transportation networks and increasing travel time. In this study, the restoration priority of bridges under seismic conditions was proposed and the seismic resilience curves were compared based on an artificial neural network model. To determine the restoration priority of bridges, 1) performance-based and 2) benefit-cost-based restoration priorities were introduced. For demonstration purposes, the actual Pohang road network was reconstructed and the seismic resilience curves of the transportation network corresponding to the proposed restoration priorities were compared. Numerical analysis showed that the performance-based restoration priority had a more rapid seismic resilience curve than benefit-cost-based restoration priority.
