AbstractThis article introduces a special issue on the school and life experiences of highly mobile students. In it, the phenomenology of high mobility is described as well as the current state of research on subpopulations of highly mobile students. In addition, the risk and resilience framework is invoked as a general theoretical crosscurrent that cuts across the articles included in the special issue that provide novel research on environmental instability, student homelessness, foster care experiences, relocation because of war, and trauma‐ and violence‐informed care. Lastly, areas for future research are discussed as highly mobile students remain an understudied yet important and growing population in need of empirical investigation and supportive intervention.
