This paper aimed at the detection of blackhole attacks and proposed a new method called as Secure and Light Weight Adhoc On demand Distance Vector Routing (SLW-AODV). SLW-AODV is an extended version of the traditional AODV routing protocol. The proposed SLW-AODV ensures resilience for both blackhole and cooperative blackhole attacks. It employs a simple Challenge, Response and Confirm (CRC) strategy with chaotic maps for the identification of both blackhole and cooperative blackhole attacks. SLW-AODV identifies the attacked nodes at both route discovery and data forwarding process. For experimental validation, we have conducted extensive simulations and the performance is validated through Packet Delivery Ratio, Throughput and Average end-to-end delay. The obtained performance metrics shows an outstanding performance than the state-of-the art methods.
