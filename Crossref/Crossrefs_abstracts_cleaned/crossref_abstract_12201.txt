A definition of resilience is the capacity to resist mental disorders despite exposure to stress. Little is known about its biological concomitants. In adults, biochemical and hormonal factors have been advocated. Smaller Corpus Callosum (CC) volume and lower Fractional Anisotropy (FA) have been observed in psychiatric and stress-related conditions. There is no Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) study of resilience in adolescence, a critical lifetime period for neural and psychological maturation. We hypothesized that higher FA in the CC would characterize stress-resilient adolescents.MethodsThree community groups were compared: resilient adolescents – with low risk of mental disorder despite high exposure to lifetime stress, adolescents at risk of mental disorder exposed to the same level of stress, and controls. Personality was assessed by NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and cognitive function by a battery of tests. Voxelwise statistics of DTI values in CC were obtained using Tract-Based Spatial Statistic. Regional projections were identified by probabilistic tractography.
resultsHigher FA values were detected in the anterior CC of resilient compared with both non-resilient and control adolescents. FA values varied according to resilience capacity. Regional changes in CC were in regions that project onto anterior cingulated and frontal cortex. Neuroticism and three other personality factors differentiated at risk adolescents from the other two groups.
ConclusionHigh FA was detected in resilient adolescents in an anterior CC region projecting to frontal areas subserving cognitive resources. Psychiatric risk in adolescents was associated with personality characteristics. Resilience in adolescence may be a dimension embedding white matter features.
