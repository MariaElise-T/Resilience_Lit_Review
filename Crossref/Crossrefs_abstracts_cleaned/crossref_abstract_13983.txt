Climate change threatens urban areas globally. Enhancing resilience is crucial, yet the comprehensive clustering of practical climate adaptation measures for use in construction industry decision-making is notably absent. This study investigates and categorizes various climate adaptation measures, justifying each through a lens of risk management, asset management, and previous scientific work. It takes advantage of the innovative digital platform Netobra, which offers an ecosystem for the construction industry, to provide real-world, practical implications of these measures. Informed by the Urban Resilience Evaluation System, ISO 31000 (risk management), and ISO 55000 (asset management), the study sets out to demonstrate the value of these measures in bolstering urban resilience and improving decision-making in the construction industry. Moreover, the study integrates a hotspot detection mechanism for areas at high risk of climate impacts, using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA)â€”analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mapping on Netobra. These identified hotspots and corresponding climate adaptation measures will further be incorporated into a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) process, providing valuable insights for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban development. Through its in-depth analysis, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of how diverse climate adaptation measures can be practically applied in various sectors, thereby enhancing urban resilience and effective risk and asset management.
