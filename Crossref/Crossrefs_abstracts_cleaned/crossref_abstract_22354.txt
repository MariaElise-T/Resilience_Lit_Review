AbstractAdverse life events can lead to stable changes in brain structure and function and are considered primary sources of risk for post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, most individuals do not develop these conditions following exposure to traumatic experiences, and research efforts have identified a number of experiential factors associated with an individual's ability to withstand, adapt to and facilitate recovery from adversity. While multiple animal models of stress resilience exist, so that the detailed biological mechanisms can be explored, studies have been disproportionately conducted in male subjects even though the prevalence and presentation of stress‐linked disorders differ between sexes. This review focuses on (a) the mechanisms by which experiential factors (behavioral control over a stressor, exercise) reduce the impact of adverse events as studied in males; (b) whether other manipulations (ketamine) that buffer against stress‐induced sequelae engage the same circuit features; and (c) whether these processes operate similarly in females. We argue that investigation of experiential factors that produce resistance/resilience rather than vulnerability to adversity will generate a unique set of biological mechanisms that potentially underlie sex differences in mood disorders.
