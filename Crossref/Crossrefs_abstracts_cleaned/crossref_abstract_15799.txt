AbstractThe importance of resilience for tourism organizations facing crises and disasters is indisputable. Yet little is known about how these organizations become resilient. This paper proposes that dynamic capabilities provide a mechanism that enables tourism organizations to respond to disruptive environmental changes through a process of routine transformation, resource allocation, and utilization. The resulting theoretical framework takes a processual view to show how an organization's existing operational routines transform into new ones that are resilient to disruptive events, enabled by dynamic capabilities and slack resources. The paper outlines six research propositions and suggests methods for future empirical research.
