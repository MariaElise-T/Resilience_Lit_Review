AbstractThis paper examines resilience in development‐oriented social enterprises in sub‐Saharan Africa drawing upon in‐depth case study research. It explores the nature of the strategic challenges faced by social enterprises in sub‐Saharan African contexts and which necessitate organisational resilience. Key resources and capabilities possessed by resilient social enterprises are identified. Finally, strategies adopted by resilient social enterprises are explored. This research not only contributes to literature on resilience in social enterprises but also works on wider organisational resilience, particularly in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, it contributes to hitherto limited work on social enterprises in sub‐Saharan Africa. Finally, this paper has implications for practicing managers in social enterprises who are looking to build organisational resilience.
