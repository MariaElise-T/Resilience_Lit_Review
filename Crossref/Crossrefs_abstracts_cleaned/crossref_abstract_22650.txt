AbstractObjectivesInformal caregiving is becoming increasingly important in dementia care, but causes a considerable burden on caregivers which impacts their wellbeing. We aimed to develop and pilot test a digital monitoring tool (REsilience Monitor for INformal caregivers in Dementia [REMIND]) for wellbeing and resilience of informal caregivers to provide timely support and thereby prevent their overburden and eventually crises admissions of persons with dementia.MethodsA human‐centered design method based on co‐creation with informal caregivers and professionals was used to design REMIND. During co‐creation meetings and in‐between sprint sessions, a point of focus was formulated, and a prototype was created. Case manager‐caregiver duos pilot‐tested REMIND for 3 months. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted to determine usability and acceptability. Thematic analysis was applied to the transcripts.ResultsInformal caregivers and professionals with varying backgrounds participated in three co‐creation meetings. Defined point of focus was to develop a tool that is able to provide insight into the experienced burden of informal caregivers. The REMIND prototype consisted of weekly questions about wellbeing and resilience for informal caregivers and a dashboard with answers for case managers. Eight case managers and 13 informal caregivers considered REMIND easy‐to‐use. Informal caregivers mentioned that REMIND stimulated self‐reflection. Case managers appreciated the tool's ability to gain insight in the actual wellbeing of informal caregivers.ConclusionsThe REMIND tool developed in co‐creation with end‐users potentially increases insight in actual wellbeing of informal caregivers for both caregivers and case managers. A long‐term (controlled) follow‐up study is needed to evaluate REMIND's impact on caregiver burden and crisis admissions.
