Background:
Nursing faculty and clinicians are leaving the profession due to increased workload and burnout. Evidence-based interventions to build skills in resilience and well-being are encouraged; however, strategies to implement them in nursing curricula and nurse residency programs (NRPs) are not well known.


Purpose:
To understand the current state of resilience, well-being, and ethics content in the curriculum in schools of nursing and NRPs in the state of Maryland as part of a statewide initiative for Renewal, Resilience and Retention of Maryland Nurses (R3).


Methods:
A descriptive survey was distributed to leaders of all Maryland nursing schools and NRP directors.


Results:
Respondents (n = 67) reported minimal resilience, well-being, and ethics content. Teaching modalities included lecture, journaling, mindfulness, and the code of ethics. Barriers included lack of faculty knowledge, low priority, time constraints, and limited resources.


Conclusion:
Resilience, well-being, and ethics content is limited in nursing curricula. Developing educator skills and best practices to foster resilience and ethical practice are needed.
