OBJECTIVE
The study objective was to investigate a charge nurse pilot training program as an effective, evidence-based training modality to improve leadership style and resiliency.


BACKGROUND
Leadership is inherent and necessary in the charge nurse role. Little published research about charge nurse leadership training programs exists.


METHODS
A pre-post design, with intervention and comparison groups, was conducted at an integrated healthcare system. A random sample of charge nurses was selected to pilot a standardized charge nurse leadership training program including in-person learning to foster leadership skills and nurture resiliency.


RESULTS
The sample included 19 control participants and 22 intervention participants. Significant improvement was noted in transformational, transactional, leadership outcomes, and resiliency from preintervention to postintervention for the all subjects. Of the 22 intervention participants, the training elicited higher satisfaction with leadership behavior, followed by effectiveness and their ability to motivate. Charge nurses who attended training had higher resiliency scores pre-post intervention.


CONCLUSION
The charge nurse pilot training was an effective program that led to improved leadership style and resiliency.
