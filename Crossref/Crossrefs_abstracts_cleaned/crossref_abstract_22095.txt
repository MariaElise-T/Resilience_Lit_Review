Recently, increasing the number and severity of the natural hazards requires the resilience assessment and enhancement of the power system, especially the microgrid system. The emergency distribution generations have great potential to enhance the resilience of microgrid against blackouts under the emergency environment. This paper investigates the resilience assessment of the microgrid system under natural hazard, where emergency distribution generations are firstly pre-positioned on system nodes and then reconfigured after system damage occurs. A new resilience metric index and an efficient approximation computation method are provided for the resilience assessment of the focused problem. A new pre-position strategy and a new reconfiguration strategy on emergency distribution generations are proposed for the microgrid system emergency restoration under natural hazard. Also, a framework of resilience assessment is provided for problem-solving. The results of extensive experiments on the modified IEEE 30-Bus system and modified IEEE 118-Bus system confirm the effectiveness of the resilience assessment methodology and the superiority of proposed restoration strategies.
