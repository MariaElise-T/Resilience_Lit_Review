 This paper studies the problem of resilient dynamic output-feedback control schemes for continuous-time networked control systems (NCSs). A decentralized hybrid strategy is utilized while network imperfections, external disturbances, and noise are considered. Moreover, during data transmission, a practical denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attack, which periodically disturbs the network channels, is considered. To preserve the network resources, a decentralized event-triggered mechanism is employed to transmit only the sampled signals that are required. It is assumed that outputs and control inputs of each subsystem are transmitted to the corresponding decentralized controllers and actuators, respectively, over the different individual channels based on independent triggering mechanisms. At first, the NCS is modeled as a decentralized hybrid system with exogenous disturbance and noise. Then, sufficient conditions that guarantee the [Formula: see text]-stability of the NCS in the presence of external disturbances and noise, which is resilient to periodic DoS attacks, are provided in terms of the linear matrix inequalities. Finally, sufficient conditions are derived to deal with the time-varying delays. It has been demonstrated that the proposed technique can be effectively applied to a well-known continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) as a benchmark example.
