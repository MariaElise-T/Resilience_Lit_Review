Aiming at problems of lack of theoretical research and existing resources, etc., in equipment’s combat resilience design for the chinese military, a new kind of equipment’s combat resilience design theory-TRIZ contradiction maters are used to describe the technical conflict in practical problem, the conflict resolving matrix is used to analysis problem, and the principle to solve the contradiction is given at last. This theory is strongly to solve the contradiction problem. For these reasons, the equipment’s combat resilience design process is proposed in this paper, and then taking the battlefield maintenance of radar phased array antenna as an example, this paper analyses the improvement design method to introduce the design of phased array antenna by using the TRIZ conflict matrix. The results show that, TRIZ conflict matrix can effectively guide the equipment’s combat resilience design, and can indicate the direction for the equipment’s combat resilience design to improve design efficiency.
