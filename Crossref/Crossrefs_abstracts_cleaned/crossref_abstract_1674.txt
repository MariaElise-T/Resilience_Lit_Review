Responding to the invitation - more than honorable - to carry out the editorial of our International Journal of Environmental Resilience Research and Science - IJERRS at the end of 2022, has a broad, multidimensional and holistic meaning for me, which must promote the balance between responsibility, duty and gratitude.
The balance of RESPONSIBILITY, tacit and implicit, must point in the direction of meeting the wishes of an international network of researchers, the International Climate Resilience Research Network - RIPERC, the multigenerational, which consolidates and strengthens itself on the foundation of theory applied to practice, since, having laid its cornerstone in an event international milestone, Â in September 2019, in a short time, starting from this "ground zero" as a structured collective, it brought to itself the noble perspective of promoting the deepening of knowledge that is as important as it is necessary, as it demonstrates the most present that we have at hand in the challenge of meeting to the urgent demands of Earth Sustainability, as it launched into the kaleidoscope of possible futures and that they are, as we preach daily in our meetings, works, thematic groups and teaching and professional practices, safer and more sustainable.
