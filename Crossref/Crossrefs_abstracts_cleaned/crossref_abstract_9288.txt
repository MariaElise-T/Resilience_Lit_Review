 This paper presents a simple and efficient reliable broadcast algorithm for asynchronous message-passing systems made up of n processes, among which up to [Formula: see text] may behave arbitrarily (Byzantine processes). This algorithm requires two communication steps and n2 − 1 messages. When compared to Bracha’s algorithm, which is resilience optimal ([Formula: see text]) and requires three communication steps and [Formula: see text] messages, the proposed algorithm shows an interesting tradeoff between communication efficiency and t-resilience.
