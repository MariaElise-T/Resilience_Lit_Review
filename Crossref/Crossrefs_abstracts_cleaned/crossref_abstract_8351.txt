AbstractThis paper presents an investigation into the effect of faults on the scalability resilience of cloud-based software services. The study introduces an experimental framework using the Application-Level Fault Injection (ALFI) to investigate how the faults at the application level affect the scalability resilience and behaviour of cloud-based software services. Previous studies on scalability analysis of cloud-based software services provide a baseline of the scalability behaviour of such services, allowing to conduct in-depth scalability investigation of these services. Experimental analysis on the EC2 cloud using a real-world cloud-based software service is used to demonstrate the framework, considering delay latency of software faults with two varied settings and two demand scenarios. The experimental approach is explained in detail. Here we simulate delay latency injection with two different times, 800 and 1600 ms, and compare the results with the baseline data. The results show that the proposed approach allows a fair assessment of the fault scenario’s impact on the cloud software service’s scalability resilience. We explain the use of the methodology to determine the impact of injected faults on the scalability behaviour and resilience of cloud-based software services.
