AbstractAlthough long‐term agricultural activity frequently decreases biodiversity, it remains unclear whether such biodiversity losses are readily reversible. There is no doubt that the important ecological function of seed bank is ecological memory, but few researchers have explored the role of seed banks in grassland ecosystem resilience and threshold theory. We used a space‐for‐time subrogation method, i.e., a natural meadow (never farmed but used for moderate gazing) and meadows farmed for 30 yr and then abandoned for 1, 10, and 20 yr, to determine if the biodiversity/ecosystem of subalpine meadows could be reversed to the natural vegetation state and to investigate the role of soil seed banks in grassland ecosystem restoration and resilience. After 20 yr of natural regeneration, aboveground vegetation composition and properties had recovered to the natural meadow state, suggesting that critical thresholds were not crossed. Seed bank composition and structure exhibited almost no change after agricultural disturbance for decades. The persistent seed bank had the highest contribution to vegetation regeneration in the 1‐yr abandoned field, which had the highest seed density. Similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation and seed density decreased with years since abandonment. Since the seed bank still reflected the desired state, the system had inherent resilience and had not have crossed the transition threshold. Thus, high‐diversity persistent seed banks are an important indicator of high resilience of this ecosystem. High similarity between the seed bank and vegetation in early‐abandoned fields may indicate that ecological resilience is triggered and be a warning signal that interventions are needed to avoid a state transition. In applying alternative stable state theory to ecological restoration, much attention should be given to the soil seed bank.
