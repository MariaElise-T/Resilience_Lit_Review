AbstractObjectiveThe aim of the current study was to identify constructive interpersonal behaviors that may make relational partners more resilient while foster caregiving.BackgroundFoster caregiving can be stressful due to the unique demands of the role. Consistent with the theory of resilience and relational load, we propose one possible way for couples to manage stress and promote resilience is by investing in their relationships through repetitive and positive relationship maintenance behaviors.MethodTwo‐parent foster caregiving couples (N = 227) completed online surveys measuring perceptions of their own and their partners' relationship maintenance and conflict management behaviors, as well as individual reports of depressive symptoms and parenting stress.ResultsStructural equation actor–partner interdependence modeling indicated significant direct and indirect actor effects, but no partner effects. Both men's and women's perceptions of the couple's relationship maintenance were positively associated with their perceptions of the couple's conflict management, which, in turn, were negatively related with their own depressive symptoms and parenting stress.ConclusionCouples' prosocial and constructive behaviors are related to lower mental distress in foster caregivers.ImplicationsCouple‐focused interventions may be helpful in promoting behaviors that enhance couple functioning and promote the well‐being of foster caregivers.
