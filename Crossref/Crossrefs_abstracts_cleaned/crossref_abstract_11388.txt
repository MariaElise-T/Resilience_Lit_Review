AbstractIntroduction: Today's students of healthcare professional courses are the pillars of future healthcare delivery system. Research studies have found that they are affected with psychological disorders.Objectives The objectives of the study were to assess the levels of well-being, resilience, and its relationship.Materials and Methods A descriptive correlational research design was adopted to assess the well-being and resilience among undergraduate students. A total of 135 participants studying in all levels of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), Bachelor of Physiotherapy (BPT), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.Sc Nursing), and Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharm) were selected by disproportionate stratified random sampling technique. The tools used for data collection were demographic Proforma, Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, and positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA) scale. The reliability of the tool was tested by using Cronbach's alpha formula that was found to have a score of 0.925 for Connor Davidson Resilience Scale and a score of 0.916 for PERMA Scale. Pilot study was conducted to find out the feasibility of the study.Statistical Analysis The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 20.0.Results The mean well-being and resilience of the study participants were 160.34 and 73.67, respectively. Majority (49.6%) had normal level of well-being and greater resilience (77%). The correlation was 0.237 and it was statistically significant (p < 0.05).Conclusion There was an association between level of well-being and selected demographic variables such as age, education, level of study, religion, and residence, whereas level of resilience had significant association with education, religion, and socioeconomic status. Students' resilience can be promoted by implementing educational strategies and creating a supportive environment.
