AbstractCOVID‐19‐associated discrimination (CAD) is an important issue that may adversely affect frontline nurses’ work effectiveness and well‐being. This study examined the relationships between frontline nurses’ perceptions of COVID‐19‐associated discrimination and their resilience, mental health, and professional‐turnover intention. This cross‐sectional descriptive study involved 259 frontline nurses in the Central Philippines and used four online self‐report measures. The results revealed that frontline nurses perceived a moderate level of COVID‐19‐associated discrimination. Frontline nurses who perceived a higher level of discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic reported poorer mental health and higher professional‐turnover intention. Resilience acted as a mediator and reduced the effects of COVID‐19‐associated discrimination on nurses’ mental health and their professional‐turnover intention. Proactive measures to reduce the negative consequences of discrimination during the pandemic, and efforts to foster resilience in nurses who are in the forefront of the fight against the highly transmissible virus, should be given high priority by hospital and nursing administrators to better support nurses’ mental health and foster retention.
