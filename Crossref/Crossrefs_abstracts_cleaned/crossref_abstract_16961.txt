With urbanization, the uncertainties faced by urban areas continue to increase, and in response, China's urban planning is transitioning from a focus on quantity to quality. Promoting system coupling and coordination helps to make urban areas more resilient to risk. This paper uses data from Luohe City (China) in 2022 as an example to calculate the inter-system coupling coordination degree (CCD), find the factors that obstruct resilience construction, and further explore the spatial heterogeneity of the obstacle factors. The synthetic evaluation model, coupling evaluation model, and obstacle diagnosis model are used to evaluate and analyze each subsystem. The results are as follows: According to the synthetic evaluation, the mean urban development value is 0.48, with high-value regions clustered in the Southeastern built-up zone. Mean value of urban coupling coordination is 0.66, the coordination level is 7 (Moderate Coordination). Urban development degree is positively correlated with CCD. Globally, the economy is the main factor obstructing resilient growth, but the core obstacle areas of the ecosystem are larger and have a wider impact. This study contributes to understanding the internal action of urban systems and provides data for balance development and urban resilience enhancement.
