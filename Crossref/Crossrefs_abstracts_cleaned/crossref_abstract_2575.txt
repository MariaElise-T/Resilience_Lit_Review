AbstractAffordability and resilience are two non‐functional requirements that are increasingly needed in 21st century systems. Since these attributes act in tradeoff fashion, a tradespace definition and evaluation framework is needed. This paper presents a model‐based approach that builds on two core capabilities: a framework to define the space system environment, and an analytic tool to set up the tradespace within the framework for tradeoff analysis with what‐if assumptions about the future space system environment.
