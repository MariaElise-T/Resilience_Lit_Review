ABSTRACT:  This paper will develop a discussion about caring as a modern mental health nurse. We argue that the demands of mental health nursing today extend beyond the more traditional skills of care and caring. We believe that in order to meet mental health needs in the 21st century that caring should be extended to encompass the additional expertise of emotional intelligence and resilience. Emotional intelligence, resilience, and resilient behaviours have the potential to assist individuals to transcend negative experiences and transform these experiences into positive self‐enhancing ones. This has implications for improved consumer outcomes through role‐modelling and educational processes, but also may hold implications in supporting a strong workforce in mental health.
