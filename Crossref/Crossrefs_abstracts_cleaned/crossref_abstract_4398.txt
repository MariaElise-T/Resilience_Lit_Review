Purpose: The coronavirus pandemic has affected people's lives. Children and adolescents are a a group affected by the consequences of the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of resilience in children and adolescents in relation to school grade, gender and school performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: In the present study 836 primary and secondary school students completed an online questionnaire on resilience during the second and third wave of the pandemic Covid-19 in Greece. Results: Primary school students reported higher levels of resilience as compared to junior high school and high school students. Furthermore, resilience levels were higher for primary and high school girls, while the reverse was true only for high school students. School performance positively correlated with resilience. Conclusion: It appears that children are better able to cope with challenges and stress demonstrating a capacity to recover from stress, adversity, failure, challenge, or even trauma. The results have implications about the design and the implementation of primary and secondary prevention of social emotional programs in the school community.
