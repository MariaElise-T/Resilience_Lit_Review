Counselors provide immediate support to individuals and communities in distressing situations, specifically crises. In this process, they face challenges due to a lack of adequate training. These difficulties cause professional and personal impairments over time. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of a Crisis Intervention course on the self-determined ways of functioning and resilience of prospective counselors. The study employed a quasi-experimental pre-posttest control group design, involving a total of 106 fourth-year counseling students, with an experimental group (N=64, students taking the Crisis Intervention course) and a control group (N=42, students following the standard curriculum). Measures included a sociodemographic form, the Self-Determination Scale, the Brief Resilience Scale, and course evaluation form. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in pretest scores but revealed significant post-course improvements in self-awareness, perceived choice, and resilience for the experimental group compared to the control group (p<.001). In addition, student evaluations highlighted the Crisis Intervention courseâ€™s positive impact on self-confidence, counseling skills, self-control, self-awareness, emotional awareness, calm attitude, and resilience to stress. These findings underline the importance of crisis intervention training for counseling students in enhancing their personal and professional development. Further research is warranted to expand the knowledge base in this critical area of counselor education.
