Content and FocusThe aim of this paper is to introduce the sense of coherence (SOC), a core construct of Antonovsky’s salutogenic model of health and resilience, and to explore its relevance for counselling and psychotherapy. Antonovsky defined the SOC as global orientation expressing the extent to which the individual perceives the stimuli deriving from one’s internal and external environments as predictable, manageable and meaningful. A strong SOC is assumed to help people to manage stress and stay healthy. Research findings show a close relationship between SOC and psychogenic aspects of health. The paper focuses on the possibilities of fostering the SOC as global orientation in a therapeutic setting. It explores the conceptual overlap between SOC and different therapeutic approaches by analysing and comparing the relevant literature. The review of the relevant literature suggests that a salutogenic framework can help to shift the therapeutic focus towards resources and actualisation of potential. This is supported by findings of research studies on counselling and psychotherapy interventions utilising the SOC as an outcome measure.ConclusionsUsed as a general framework in working with clients, the SOC has the potential to put salutogenic resources, actualisation of potential and empowerment processes at the centre of therapeutic attention.
