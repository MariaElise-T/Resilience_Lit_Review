Theoretical conceptualisations of resilience and recovery are examined in this paper to determine how critical elements of information behaviour interact while individuals attempt to regain equilibrium following a crisis event. Situated within the larger historical, social, scientific and psychological landscape, this review of the literature suggests that individuals who actively engage in positive information behaviour are generally perceived as better able to acquire needed resources to aid in recovery efforts post-trauma in order to achieve equilibrium or even improve on their previous status to achieve a level above that (thriving). Individuals who experience information difficulties find recovering or thriving more difficult and may be perceived as less resilient.
