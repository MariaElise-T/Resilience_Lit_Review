Abstract
 Psychological well-being is one of the greatest concerns in children and adolescents with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF). Those youths are frequently exposed to stress and social inequality, and they are particularly prone to developing mental health issues which persist through adolescence and into adult life. The purpose of this article is to introduce a framework for promoting psychological resilience in children and adolescents with BIF. Three interrelated and complementary factors require professional attention and efforts to improve resilience in children with borderline intelligence: a) protecting a child’s self-worth, b) generating sources of social support, c) training of adaptive coping skills. The significance of early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of a child’s development is also discussed. Children with BIF should be provided with internal (self-worth, coping skills) and external (social support) resources to enhance their resilience and ability to confront adversities, and to reduce the risk of mental health issues.
