The core theme was the motivating role of professional commitment to emergency patient care.ConclusionsThe results of this study can inform the development of support systems to enhance the resilience of nurses experiencing workplace violence by alerting healthcare administrators and governing institutions to their needs.Clinical RelevanceEmergency nurses viewed professional growth and professional commitment as an invisible motivator in the development of resilience following an encounter with workplace violence.
