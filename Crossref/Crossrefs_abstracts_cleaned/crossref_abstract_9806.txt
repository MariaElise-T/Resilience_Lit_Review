This study was conducted to know Indonesia sustainable tourism resilience in the COVID-19 era. The research was done through a qualitative approach then analyzed based on the sentiment analysis and tourism resilience theory. The data used on this study are review data related to five super-priority tourism destinations in Indonesia, which are Borobudur Temple, Lake Toba, Labuan Bajo, Mandalika and Likupang since January 2020 to March 2021 from TripAdvisor. The result of this study shows that Indonesia sustainable tourism resilience during the pandemic COVID-19 era does not have strong enough resilience in facing the unstable recessions conditions and following new tourism trends that have emerged in the pandemic era or after the pandemic ends. This study provides two recommendations to overcome those problems: (a) Indonesia needs to develop local tourism activities based on the e-tourism concept and (b) the tourism activity must integrate with digitalization and local wisdom to create local common branding in the destination.
