This article examines adult foster care for older people in Finland. This is a semi-formal service in which older people are cared for by foster carers who are remunerated for their work by the local municipality. In the article, the tensions and resources of resilience of foster-care work are analysed. The data consist of 12 thematic interviews with foster carers. The results suggest that foster-care work is emotionally draining and has adverse effects on social relationships. However, foster carers see caring as purposeful, they see themselves as professionals and they have enough social resources.
