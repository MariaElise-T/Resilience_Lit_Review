We report on an emerging application focused on the design of resilient long reach passive optical networks using combinatorial optimisation techniques. The objective of the application is to determine the optimal position and capacity of a set of metro nodes. We specifically consider dual parented networks whereby each customer must be associated with two metro nodes. An important property of such a placement is resilience to single node failure. Therefore excess capacity should be provided at each metro node in order to ensure that customers can be redistributed amongst the metro sites. Our application, as well as finding optimal node placements, can compute the minimum level of excess capacity on all metro nodes. In this paper we present three alternative approaches to optimal metro node placement. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of different placement approaches on the distribution of excess capacity throughout the network. We show that preferential distributions occur in practice, based on a case-study in Ireland. Finally we show that load and excess capacity provision are independent of each other.
