AbstractOrganizational resilience enables the firm to thrive in an increasingly turbulent environment, paving the way for sustainability. Although the implications of organizational resilience on sustainability have been widely discussed in the literature, scholarly knowledge examining the interplay between these two phenomena is fragmented. The article addresses this gap through a hybrid domain‐based literature review falling at the intersection of organizational resilience and sustainability. Drawing on a knowledge core of 51 scientific contributions, we identified four research streams established on five conceptual foundations. The study findings guide us toward an eco‐social interpretation of organizational resilience, whose implications on the firm's viability should be assessed by acknowledging spillovers on environmental sustainability. Management actions to build organizational resilience should follow an ecosystem sustainability orientation. This involves embedding the firm in the eco‐social setting in which it operates, emphasizing its homeostatic exchanges with the environment.
