The statistical population consisted of 40 housewives (20 in Pilates group and 20 in control group) that were selected using the available sampling by referring to a sports club in District 2, Tehran. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance, and the adjusted comparison was conducted at the significance level of 5%.The results showed that the adjusted mean of the scores of resiliency and psych-asthenia for the intervention group are significantly different (p&gt;5.0) and there is a significant difference between the mean scores of resiliency and psych-asthenia of the treatment and control groups. Pilates exercises increase resiliency and decrease psych-asthenia of the housewives.
