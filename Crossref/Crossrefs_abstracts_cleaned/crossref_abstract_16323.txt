 A diverse sample of LGBTQ+ people ( N = 527) was recruited to explore sexual and gender diverse peoples’ co-occurring experiences with community resilience resources and inequity within the LGBTQ+ community. Using latent profile analysis, four distinctive latent profiles emerged: Marginalized, Ambivalent, Disengaged, and Embedded. Beta regression analyses suggested that identity centrality played a pivotal role in a participants’ membership to a given profile. Additionally, plurisexual and gender diverse identities may be associated with less likelihood of membership in profiles that were high in LGBTQ+ community resilience resources. Profile membership was also associated with mental health, internalized minority stress, and LGBTQ+ identity affirmation. The present study assists in expanding the understanding of co-occurring processes (i.e., community resilience resources and inequity within the LGBTQ+ community) and how they link to mental health, internalized minority stress, and positive LGBTQ+ identity outcomes for sexual and gender diverse people. We discuss implications for practice, education, training, and research.
