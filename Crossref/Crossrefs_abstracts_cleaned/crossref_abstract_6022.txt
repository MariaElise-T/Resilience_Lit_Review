Abstract
Most cellular functions are carried out by a dynamic network of interacting proteins. An open question is whether the network properties of protein interactomes represent phenotypes under natural selection. One proposal is that protein interactomes have evolved to be resilient, such that they tend to maintain connectivity when proteins are removed from the network. This hypothesis predicts that interactome resilience should be maintained by natural selection during long-term experimental evolution. I tested this prediction by modeling the evolution of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks in Lenski’s long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE). In this test, I removed proteins affected by nonsense, insertion, deletion, and transposon mutations in evolved LTEE strains, and measured the resilience of the resulting networks. I compared the rate of change of network resilience in each LTEE population to the rate of change of network resilience for corresponding randomized networks. The evolved PPI networks are significantly more resilient than networks in which random proteins have been deleted. Moreover, the evolved networks are generally more resilient than networks in which the random deletion of proteins was restricted to those disrupted in LTEE. These results suggest that evolution in the LTEE has favored PPI networks that are, on average, more resilient than expected from the genetic variation across the evolved strains. My findings therefore support the hypothesis that selection maintains protein interactome resilience over evolutionary time.
