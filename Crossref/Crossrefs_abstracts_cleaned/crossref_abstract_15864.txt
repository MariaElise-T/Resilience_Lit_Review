Abstract
In 2030, more than 73% of Indonesia’s population is predicted to live in cities. Under that massive population concentration, urban problems are becoming more difficult and complex to deal with. Besides chronic pressures of the existing problems, when disasters occur, urban areas and their population are also more prone to be exposed to shocks, leading to increased vulnerability, uncertainty, and risks of the cities. This situation demands the communities and whole urban systems to develop better urban resilience. This paper describes our quantitative study in Semarang City that aims to build an index using secondary data by considering 5 dimensions: social, economic, infrastructure, institutional, and hazard and shows resilience level in scores from 0 – 1 where 0 representing very low and 1 the best. The results shows here are only 3 sub-districts that are at the level of high resilience (Semarang Selatan, Banyumanik, Semarang Tengah) and the infrastructure dimension is a very influencing factor. The index allows for equal spatial and temporal comparisons of several regions, which is important when it comes to conducting further studies on the regional dynamics and making priorities of which areas should be resilience-increased towards sustainable urban development.
