Abstract
Urban agglomeration is the spatial organization form of urban development and the main carrier of population, economy and information gathering to promote regional coordinated development. Therefore, it is important to research the sustainable development of urban agglomeration. Focus on the scientific issue of the relationship between power-law distribution structure of spatial elements and spatial resilience of urban agglomeration; using the number of urban permanent population and urban built-up area size as the key spatial elements of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, firstly, we discussed the spatial-temporal evolution law of power-law characteristics of key spatial elements of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. Secondly, we revealed the response mechanism of spatial resilience to power-law distribution of key spatial elements of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. The conclusions as following: (1) The spatial resilience of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration characterized as “concentration” dominated by large cities. (2) The spatial resilience and Pareto distribution of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration have a remarkable and stable response relationship. (3) In order to maximize the spatial resilience of Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration, it is urgent to control the number of urban permanent population and built-up area scale of large cities.
