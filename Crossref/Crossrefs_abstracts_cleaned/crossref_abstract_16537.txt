AbstractThe continued problem of bullying merits prevention. The resilience programme studied in this research teaches victimisation avoidance skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a resilience programme on social skills, victimisation, and bullying among eight to thirteen‐year‐old students. This quantitative, quasi‐experimental design sampled students’ self‐reported social skills (n = 72), bullying (n = 67), and victimisation (n = 67) in two, Northeastern U.S. schools. Paired samples t‐test analyses showed that the programme had positive effects on social skills, no effects on bullying, and negative effects on victimisation. Recommendations were made regarding bullying prevention and future research.
