Numerous studies have investigated how multi-capital establishes hotel resilience, but only some have evaluated the essential element that becomes a hotel management priority. This article aims to examine the direct effect of multi-capital on hotel resilience and explore critical factors that need to be improved in building hotel resilience post-COVID-19. 91 managers of three- and four-star hotels participated in this study. A questionnaire was used to collect the data, which was then analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM-PLS) to examine the effect between variables and further processed with Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA). Tnterviews were done to refine the findings. The study demontrates that human capital is crucial in a hotel's resilience to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that hotel management should prioritize developing their adaptive capacity, particularly concerning the commitment of employees to fight. Moreover, hotels need an improved income source, marketing strategy and emphasis on life safety. This research contributes to the hotel industry's strategy by applying a multi-capital approach to support the hospitality industry during the global health crisis.
