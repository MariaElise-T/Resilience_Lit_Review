 The 10-item Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) is a self-report instrument widely used to assess resilience in particular demographics. This study aimed to evaluate the validity and measurement invariance (MI) of the CD-RISC-10 in Chinese left-behind children. A total of 968 children from three middle schools in Guizhou Province participated in this study, with the CD-RISC-10 used twice, at the base line time point and again after six months. The Ego-resilience Scale (ERS), and General Self-efficiency Scale (GSES-10) were also used as criteria-related validity instruments. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out to examine the one-factor model and the MI with regards to gender and left-behind status, as well as the longitudinal measurement invariance (LMI). The study proved satisfactory reliability and validity of the CD-RISC-10, with good criterion validity with the ERS and GSES-10. CFA results showed that the satisfactory model fit for the one-factor structure was supported in all groups (e.g., CFI = .942, TLI = .925, RMSEA = .057). The strict MI was evident across genders, as well as both the left-behind and non-left-behind groups. Additionally, the LMI of the CD-RISC-10 was also adequately supported. Generally speaking, these findings demonstrate that the CD-RISC-10 can effectively measure the resilience level of left-behind children – boys as well as girls – in China.
