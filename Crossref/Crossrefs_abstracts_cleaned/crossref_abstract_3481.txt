Methodological approaches to assess the human cognitive status are constantly evolving. At the same time, the creation of new assessment methods is accompanied by traditional research. This paper discusses the direction of research on the search for markers of stress resilience. The basis for the formation of the research algorithm was the assessment of activation factors of emotional states, including preceding stress–sensory (cognitive and informational) and psycho-emotional factors. This was determined using methodological techniques, stress factors, working conditions in professional teams, etc. For an express analysis (25–40 min) of diagnosing stress resistance, a research algorithm was justified, consisting of clinical and psychological testing, as well as EEG with traditional tests and analysis of indicators and spectra. Therefore, this research was aimed at the psychological and neurophysiological substantiation of approaches to express algorithms for assessing cognitive functions and resilience to stress under time deficit. A study on 102 healthy subjects and 38 outpatients of a neuropsychiatric clinic was performed. Basic outcomes: the integrative indicator SCL-90-R—”general index of severity” has a high statistical significance (p < 0.05) in both healthy subjects and neuropsychiatric outpatients. The effectiveness of the Mini-Mult test in conditions of time deficit is determined by the results of the scales of hypochondria, depression, hysteria, paranoia, psychasthenia, schizoid and hypomania (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we used a line of logical thinking techniques. A line of four logical methods is highly informative in assessing the mental status in conditions of time deficit. EEG power indices and spectra in theta, delta and alpha frequency ranges are an effective reflection of cognitive status. In this article, a testing algorithm as a variant for assessing neurocognitive status in screening studies of large groups is discussed.
