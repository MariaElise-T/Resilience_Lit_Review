Objectives In an era of increasing uncertainties in the vocational society, the effect of entrepreneurship on career resilience was analyzed through the dual mediating effect of formal and informal learning in order to propose a method to increase career resilience. Methods To this end, 824 four-year college students in the metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas were tested to measure entrepreneurship, formal learning, informal learning, and career resilience. The analysis was performed with a bootstrap using SPSS 22 and PROCESS macro 3.3. Results Entrepreneurship had a significant effect on career resilience, and it was confirmed that formal and informal learning had not only a mediating effect but also a sequential double mediating effect in the relationship between entrepreneurship and career resilience. In addition, the innovative initiative of entrepreneurship had a positive effect on the individual and job factors of career resilience, but did not affect the social factors. The risk-taking of entrepreneurship had a significant effect on the personal, job, and social factors of career resilience. Conclusions By confirming that college students' entrepreneurship affects formal learning, informal learning, and career resilience, the scope of academic research on the effect of entrepreneurship was expanded, suggesting implications for youth and college students' entrepreneurship education research. In addition, the importance of entrepreneurship and learning was proposed as a specific method to increase career resilience of college students.
