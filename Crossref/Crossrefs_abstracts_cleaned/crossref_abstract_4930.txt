Abstract
This article examines the narratives of journalism relevant to journalism education from the perspective of those who ‘do’ journalism education in the United Kingdom. It draws on interviews with twelve individuals between 2006 and 2016 from within two distinct groups, both of which share a professional interest in journalism education: journalism educators with the UK Higher Education (HE) sector and former practicing journalists from within the industry who have a particular interest in journalism education, either as employers or as trainers within the industry. Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory and Carlson’s theory of metajournalistic discourse the interviews highlight what Mensing describes as ‘industry-centred journalism education’ as being particularly resilient in the English HE sector. Despite reflexive notions of ‘digital disruption’ from within centres of journalism education, the practice-driven, industry-orientated approach to journalism education remains remarkably resilient over time.
