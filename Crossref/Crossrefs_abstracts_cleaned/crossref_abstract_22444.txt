ObjectivesThis study aims to assess the level of resilience of medical workers in radiology departments in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore associated factors.SettingMedical staff, including nurses, technicians, radiology specialists and physicians, working in radiology departments at government hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 outbreak.DesignA cross-sectional study.ParticipantsThe study was conducted among 375 medical workers in radiology departments in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The data collection took place from 15 February 2022 to 31 March 2022.ResultsThe total resilience score was 29.37±6.760 and the scores of each dimension showed that the higher mean score was observed in the domain of ‘flexibility’, while the lowest was observed in ‘maintaining attention under stress’. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there was a significant negative correlation between resilience and perceived stress (r=–0.498, p<0.001). Finally, based on multiple linear regression analysis, factors affecting resilience among participants are the availability of psychological hotline (available, B=2.604, p<0.050), knowledge of COVID-19 protective measures (part of understanding, B=−5.283, p<0.001), availability of adequate protective materials (partial shortage, B=−2.237, p<0.050), stress (B=−0.837, p<0.001) and education (postgraduate, B=−1.812, p<0.050).ConclusionsThis study sheds light on the level of resilience and the factors that contribute to resilience in radiology medical staff. Moderate levels of resilience call for health administrators to focus on developing strategies that can effectively help cope with workplace adversities.
