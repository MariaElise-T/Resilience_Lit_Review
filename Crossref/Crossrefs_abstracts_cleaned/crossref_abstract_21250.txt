This study examined the moderating and mediating effects of ego-resilience, parenting behaviour, and peer attachment on the relationship between smartphone dependency and aggression. Participants included 1863 middle school youths who used smartphones and had responded to the 7th Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), which was conducted by Koreaâ€™s National Youth Policy Institute. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and hierarchical regression analyses. First, ego-resilience showed a partial mediating effect on the relationship between smartphone dependency and aggression (significant moderating effects were revealed). Second, parenting behaviour demonstrated a partial mediating effect on the relationship between smartphone dependency and aggression (no moderating effects observed). Third, peer attachment had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between smartphone dependency and aggression (no moderating effects were observed). These findings suggest that mental health and student growth can be improved as children develop by implementing various nursing and health care programs designed to improve ego-resilience, parenting behaviour, and peer attachment.
