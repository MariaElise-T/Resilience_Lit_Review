 In the face of environmental adversities, Latina college students demonstrate resilience. A psychosocial framework was applied in this study to evaluate perceptions of barriers (i.e., environmental risk), COVID-19 distress (i.e., personal vulnerability), social support (i.e., environmental protective), and mindfulness (i.e., personal strength) as predictors of Latina studentsâ€™ resilience. Only social support and mindfulness contributed to resilience after controlling for demographic factors. Findings enhance strengths-based literature in resilience and have theoretical, research, and practical implications.
