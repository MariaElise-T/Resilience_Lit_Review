Modern trainable image recognition models are vulnerable to different types of perturbations; hence, the development of resilient intelligent algorithms for safety-critical applications remains a relevant concern to reduce the impact of perturbation on model performance. This paper proposes a model and training method for a resilient image classifier capable of efficiently functioning despite various faults, adversarial attacks, and concept drifts. The proposed model has a multi-section structure with a hierarchy of optimized class prototypes and hyperspherical class boundaries, which provides adaptive computation, perturbation absorption, and graceful degradation. The proposed training method entails the application of a complex loss function assembled from its constituent parts in a particular way depending on the result of perturbation detection and the presence of new labeled and unlabeled data. The training method implements principles of self-knowledge distillation, the compactness maximization of class distribution and the interclass gap, the compression of feature representations, and consistency regularization. Consistency regularization makes it possible to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to obtain a robust model and implement continuous adaptation. Experiments are performed on the publicly available CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets using model backbones based on modules ResBlocks from the ResNet50 architecture and Swin transformer blocks. It is experimentally proven that the proposed prototype-based classifier head is characterized by a higher level of robustness and adaptability in comparison with the dense layer-based classifier head. It is also shown that multi-section structure and self-knowledge distillation feature conserve resources when processing simple samples under normal conditions and increase computational costs to improve the reliability of decisions when exposed to perturbations.
