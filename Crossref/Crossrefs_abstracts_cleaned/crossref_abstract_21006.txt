AbstractThis study sought to discern the association of resilience, coping, and contextual factors on depression and anxiety among Ukrainian children displaced to Poland following the Russo‐Ukrainian war. A cross‐sectional analysis was undertaken with 284 Ukrainian children, aged 11–15 years, relocated to Poland in 2022 due to the ongoing conflict. Participants were assessed using validated tools for anxiety, depression, resilience, and coping, alongside a study‐specific questionnaire. Notable associations emerged between depression and variables including age (Mage = 12.04, 49% females), emotional coping, relational resilience, and significant loss, accounting for 39% of the variance (p < .001). Anxiety was intricately linked with heightened emotional coping and diminished problem‐solving capabilities, accounting for notable variances (state: 32%, trait: 45%, p < .001). Resilience, particularly in relational contexts, and the experience of bereavement stood out as paramount determinants of mental health outcomes. Children's mental health in conflict zones is shaped by a convoluted interplay of individual and environmental factors. This study accentuates the pivotal role of relational resilience, bereavement, and coping mechanisms in modulating depression and anxiety amidst war‐related adversities. It underscores the imperative for targeted interventions, fostering positive relationship frameworks, and enhancing adaptive coping mechanisms.
