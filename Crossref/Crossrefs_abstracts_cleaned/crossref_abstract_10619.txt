 This study examined a sample of 45 emails written by adults in response to an Internet article on how to help children develop resilience and cope with hardship in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Most of the sample's recommendations for helping children achieve these goals were similar to those promoted by organizations like the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). However, the sample responses failed to include school-based support services, suggesting that schools (and other community organizations) may need to increase parental awareness of their services. Limitations of the current study and implications of the use of email data in research are discussed.
