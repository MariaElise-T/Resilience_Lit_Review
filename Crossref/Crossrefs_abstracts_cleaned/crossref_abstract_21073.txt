SummaryAn industrial symbiosis (IS) network (ISN) is a typical complex system, and resilience is one of its core features. In this article, we investigated the relationship between resilience and interdependency within and between various IS systems. An interdependent network model was proposed based on complex network theory, which preserved the heterogeneity of exchange content and the diversity of symbiosis relationships. We used Yixing Economic and Technological Development Zone (YETDZ) in Jiangsu, China, as the case to construct a material exchange network and three infrastructure‚Äêsharing networks. The result implied that increased interdependency contributed to the vulnerability of the system, but it did not necessarily contribute to its resilience. In our model, we identified the significant companies, materials, and infrastructure pipes in YETDZ through centrality metrics and proved the fragility of the system when deliberate changes took place in these components. We also showed the consequence of cascading failures in a single network and distinguished the most vulnerable companies exposed to failures by simulations. The interdependency between material exchange and infrastructure systems were analyzed in two scenarios, and the results implied that more attention should be placed on the key components between different IS systems. In such cases, both managers and planners of ISNs should take proper actions to enhance the adaptability of ISNs, protect significant components, and control cascading failures. The awareness of interdependency should be an indispensable part in future planning and management.
