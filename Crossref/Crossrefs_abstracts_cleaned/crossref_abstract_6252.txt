The interviews focused on experiences of bullying victimization and the long‐term outcomes of these experiences. Qualitative methods were used in the analysis, with a specific focus on resilience.Results/ConclusionThe findings illustrate how long‐term outcomes of bullying victimization in school, in relation to resilience, comprise a dynamic process between personal agency and social resources in the environmental context.
