The smart city (SC) concept is currently one of the leading ideas in the field of management. It has also become important for Polish cities in terms of sustainable development. Therefore, it is important to determine the priority in urban development; and the areas that need investment to make cities smart. Based on the literature review, it can be stated that there are many available concepts of SCs since the level of development of many cities in the world is different and the priorities of the developed areas vary. The identified SC management models present common parts, resulting from the defining basis, as well as additional aspects important for an SC, stemming from their specificity and the approach of their managers. Thus, the aim of the article is to propose the authorâ€™s model of resilient smart city development in Poland. To achieve the objective, a systematic literature review was applied, and the analysis of existing SC management models in the world was carried out in order to identify these models components and documents profiling SC strategies. These areas should be the focus of managers when creating city development strategies in Poland.
