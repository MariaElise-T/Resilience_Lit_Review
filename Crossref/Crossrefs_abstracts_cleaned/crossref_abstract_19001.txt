AbstractSolutions to global problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss require educational frameworks and accompanying teaching resources that are theory‚Äêbased, interdisciplinary, and accessible to broad undergraduate and graduate student audiences. Ecological resilience theory (ERT) is a framework with established interdisciplinary application to complex global problems, but despite an emphasis on the utility of resilience in national higher education frameworks, we found that many current ecology textbooks incorporate multiple definitions and highly variable amounts of discussion on core resilience concepts. To facilitate the use of innovative teaching resources in ERT in universities, this paper describes four free multimedia tools and templates that align with national education frameworks and are available for innovation and development by educators interested in ERT. The products are (1) content modules on core terms and concepts of ERT, (2) a classroom game and discussion, (3) interactive case studies, and (4) a complementary podcast based on resilience concepts and interviews with resilience experts to supplement formal classroom education. We contextualize the opportunities of ERT and thinking for students in university classrooms, as well as the benefits of involving graduate students and encouraging their initiative with this type of project. We conclude with a brief discussion of future opportunities for these types of educational resources. Our intent is that these resources be available for educators and researchers to facilitate interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and innovation to address complex global problems from a core educational framework of ERT.
