The goal of the research is to assess the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on the three dimensions of resilience of farming sectors: robustness, adaptability and transformability. The chosen subject of the research was Polish horticulture and the examined period was the financial framework 2014-2020. The research was based on qualitative data analysis, including policy documents analysis and the focus group research. The results showed that the level of instruments and the CAP is more focused on robustness than on the level of goals, where there is more balance between robustness and adaptability. On both a goal and instruments level, transformability is the least supported from all three resilience capabilities. Taking the challenges of the horticulture sector into account, the CAP does not sufficiently answer the economic challenges of the sector. Overall, robustness, although supported by the CAP, could be supported much more effectively, if the implementation of instruments were more intensified in the sector. Better implementation requires the improvement of educational activities. Social education is not sufficiently implemented to meet the needs of the sector. In addition, the CAP, on a moderate level, in the case of both goals and instruments, supports other characteristics of adaptability. For the horticulture farming sector, which is one of the least benefiting from direct payments, the support of adaptability and transformability seems to be vital for its development.
