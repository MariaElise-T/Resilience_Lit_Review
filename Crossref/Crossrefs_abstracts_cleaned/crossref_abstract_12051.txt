This study aims to examine the role of parental migration status and parent communication in the psychological and related behavioral status of left-behind children and their psychological resilience. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Anhui Province of China, and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 1992 teens using the Chinese version of the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale (PACS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ). Compared with the never left-behind group, left behind children had relatively lower PACS, CD-RISC and SDQ scores. Absence of parents is related with poorer psychological resilience, while good parent communication is related with better psychological resilience. Better psychological resilience is related to fewer psychological problems regardless of parental migration status. Currently left-behind status demonstrated a negative influence on psychological resilience, while never left-behind status had a positive effect. Interventions are needed to enhance psychological resilience of left-behind children to prevent psychological and related behavioral problems.
