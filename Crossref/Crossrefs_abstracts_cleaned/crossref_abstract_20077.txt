AbstractBased on the social identity model of collective action (SIMCA), this study examined factors associated with immigrant collective civic action, while also testing the role of group resilience. A convenience sample of 226 first‐generation immigrants (58.6% female) of different nationalities completed a self‐report questionnaire. Partial least squares path modelling was used to test a model assessing the relationship between national and ethnic identity and collective civic action, mediated by collective efficacy, perceptions of collective unfair treatment, and group resilience. Results confirmed the identity–efficacy pathway to collective civic action for both national and ethnic identity, but not the ethnic identity–injustice or the ethnic identity–group resilience pathways. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
