Research on the resilience of athletes has attracted the attention of scholars in the last three decades. The incorporation of statistics has led to rapid advances in sports research, with a major focus on the factors that influence resilience, such as the sport in which the athlete is engaged, the standard of the athlete, the age and the gender, and so on. The methodology of sports statistics is also worth discussing, and the mainstream data analysis methods in the current literature include t-test, ANOVA and linear regression. This paper pulls together a considerable amount of relevant literature at the cutting edge and high academic level and analyzes what they study. We point out recognized findings and contradictions, indicating research directions and academic gaps for future theoretical research.
