Purpose
The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of scenario planning on participant ratings of resilience.


Design/methodology/approach
The research design is a quasi experimental pretest/posttest with treatment and control groups. Random selection or assignment was not achieved.


Findings
Results show a significant difference in reports of resilience for the scenario planning treatment group and no significant difference for the control group.


Research limitations/implications
Limitations include the use of self-report perception measures, possible social desirability of responses and a lack of random selection and assignment.


Practical implications
Practical implications imply that scenario planning can be viewed as a legitimate tool for increasing resilience in organizations.


Social implications
Organizations with an ability to adjust quickly and recover from difficult conditions means reduced layoffs and healthy economic growth.


Originality/value
While there is increasing research on scenario planning, to date, none has examined the effects of scenarios on resilience.
