            Early intervention treatment programs have begun to play an increasingly important role in improving long-term outcomes for people with psychosis. These programs focus on helping people achieve recovery through reducing the risk of relapse, improving illness self-management skills, and making progress toward a meaningful life. This article describes Individual Resiliency Training (IRT), the individual therapy component of the Recovery After Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP). As part of a comprehensive specialty care program for people with first-episode psychosis (FEP), IRT uses a strengths-based approach that focuses on progress toward individual recovery goals, as well as improving social functioning and overall well-being. IRT addresses recovery by engaging in illness self-management, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Psychosis, and psychiatric rehabilitation skills. Two illustrative cases show how people can use information and skills within the IRT modules to make progress toward recovery and learn individualized skills to address common challenges. Within a coordinated specialty care program, IRT provides strategies and skills that promote recovery and resiliency, and shows promise toward improved illness outcomes for people with FEP.
