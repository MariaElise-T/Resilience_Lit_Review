Climate change and low agricultural productivity are the major hurdles facing sorghum farming in the Lake Zone Region of Tanzania. However, there is limited information on the contribution of sustainable projects in greening the sorghum value chain in Tanzania. This study aims to analyze how to develop a resilient and sustainable sorghum value chain using a project approach. Primary and secondary data were collected and used. Primary data were collected using key informant interviews (KII) administered to the value chain actors using audio recordings and notes. Secondary data were obtained from project-related project documents, reports, publications, and conference proceedings. The audio recordings were transcribed into lengthy notes summarized for ease of interview theme identification. To enhance access to improved seeds and fertilizers and advisory services, a linkage between the agro-dealers (input suppliers), farmers, and extension personnel was established to improve farmers’ yield potential. Good agricultural practices, e.g., planting methods and pest management and improved seed varieties that were drought tolerant, early maturing, and high yielding, such as Macia and Tegemeo, were readily available in shops and promoted through the establishment of demo plots. Local aggregation of sorghum grain helped to ease transport-to-market logistics for farmers and contributed to lower transport costs. Mechanized threshing was promoted to ensure the high-quality crop is sold to the off-taker for premium prices and meets the export market requirements. We highlight the Lake Zone project experiences and lessons learned to demonstrate the potential for building resilience and sustainability of the sorghum value chain.
