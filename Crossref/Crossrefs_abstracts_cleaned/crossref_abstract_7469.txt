In their work, social workers in mental health services experience a high level of work-related stressors. The literature considers that resilience helps social workers to cope effectively with pressures, learn from their experiences, and develop personally and professionally. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study involving 16 social workers working with adults with mental and intellectual disabilities in different services in Bihor County. The results of the study highlight the importance of developing resilience as a factor in coping with stress. The development of resilience is based on the relationship between social workers and the work environment. Organizations contribute by creating a suitable working environment, offering support, etc. Personal characteristics such as self-esteem, adaptability, hopefulness, sense of humor, coping based on problem approach and less focus on emotions, initiative, and creativity, but also social skills and the development of supportive relationships and openness to new experiences, are key elements in this context.
