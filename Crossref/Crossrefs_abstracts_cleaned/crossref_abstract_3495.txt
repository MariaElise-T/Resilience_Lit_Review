Abstract
Cell reprogramming by somatic cell nuclear transfer and in induced pluripotent stem cells is associated with epigenetic modifications that are often incompatible with embryonic development and differentiation. For instance, aberrant DNA methylation patterns of the differentially methylated region and biallelic expression of H19-/IGF2-imprinted gene locus have been associated with abnormal growth of fetuses and placenta in several mammalian species. However, cloned horses are born with normal sizes and with no apparent placental anomalies, suggesting that H19/IGF2 imprinting may be epigenetically stable after reprogramming in this species. In light of this, we aimed at characterizing the equid H19 gene to determine whether imprinting is altered in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-derived conceptuses and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines using the mule hybrid model. A CpG-rich region containing five CTCF binding sites was identified upstream of the equine H19 gene and analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. Coupled with parent-specific and global H19 transcript analysis, we found that the imprinted H19 remains monoallelic and that on average the methylation levels of both parental differentially methylated regions in embryonic and extra-embryonic SCNT tissues and iPSC lines remained unaltered after reprogramming. Together, these results show that, compared to other species, equid somatic cells are more resilient to epigenetic alterations to the H19-imprinted locus during SCNT and iPSC reprogramming.
