Over the past three decades, growing literature have examined the role of resilience in helping individuals to thrive from adversities. Resilience was studied among children growing under high-risk conditions, genocide survivors, immigrants, patients, and recently, physicians. Through a narrative review, this article critically examines resilience construct development, definitions, and themes, its generalisability across domains, and stability over time. Similarities and distinguishing characteristics of resilience and related terms such as hardiness, mental toughness, work engagement and grit are discussed. The article then discusses the evolution of resilience studies, available interventions and the implication of the current understanding for future research in the context of physicians.
