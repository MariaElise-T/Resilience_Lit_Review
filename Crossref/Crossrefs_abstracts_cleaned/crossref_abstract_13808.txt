 I explore how I—a person born with a physical disability living alone in a foreign country—was able to cope with COVID-19 lockdown. I used the autoethnographic method (Chang, 2016) to scrutinize sources of my resilience. Through evocative autoethnography, I reviewed risks/coping strategies recalling the lessons drawn from my childhood in the care of two supportive women. Then, performing analytical autoethnography, I self-assessed my lived experiences through a social science lens. A theoretical validation of my personal story helped me to acknowledge how resilience in my life had been built and was mobilized in the face of the pandemic.
