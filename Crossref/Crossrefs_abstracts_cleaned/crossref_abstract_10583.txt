PurposeThis paper aims to analyze the effects of organizational resilience on job satisfaction and business performance in companies that have undergone corporate reorganizations.Design/methodology/approachA survey was carried out on a sample of 102 executives and managers from Brazilian companies that underwent corporate reorganization. The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicate that organizational resilience influences business performance (in the dimensions of economy-financial, customers and processes/learning) and job satisfaction (in the dimensions of financial and personal benefits). However, the relations between job satisfaction and business performance were partial, indicating that satisfaction can affect performance through other variables.Research limitations/implicationsThe main study implication lies on the empirical immersion regarding the effects of active organizational resilience on multi-faceted business performance, to the detriment of only the financial view and on job satisfaction.Practical implicationsThe distinct effects of resilience on business performance and job satisfaction provide managers with insight into how to allocate resources, in order to benefit the interests of both employer and employee.Originality/valueThis is one of the first studies to provide empirical evidence of the effects of active organizational resilience on multi-dimensional business performance. The results provide new insights into this relationship and may clarify divergent results found in the literature. It also provides evidence of the effects of active organizational resilience on job satisfaction in companies that have undergone corporate reorganizations, events that are supposed to require resilient skills.
