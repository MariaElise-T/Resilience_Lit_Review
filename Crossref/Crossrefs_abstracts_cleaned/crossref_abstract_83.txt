Natural hazards can turn into disasters when not managed well. An important part of disaster risk reduction is to understand how well communities are prepared for natural hazards and how well they can cope with and recover from shocks in the long term. This research assesses self‐reported community resilience and asks what makes a community resilient, using Australia as a case study. It reports on an Australian‐wide online survey which included questions related to the Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measurement, a subjective indicator, as well as questions about risk perception, well‐being, and self‐efficacy. Community resilience was found to be moderately high but scores for community leadership and preparedness were low. Perceived community resilience was positively correlated with age and those with high scores for self‐efficacy and well‐being. There was, as expected, an inverse relationship between reliance on external support during natural hazards and self‐efficacy. The results complement previous studies which used different measures of community resilience.
