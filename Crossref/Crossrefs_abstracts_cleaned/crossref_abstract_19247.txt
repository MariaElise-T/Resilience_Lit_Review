The coupling and coordination between green finance (GF) and economic resilience (ER) are the foundation of sustainable economic development. This paper uses the panel data of 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) in mainland China from 2011 to 2021 to calculate the comprehensive development level of the two systems by the entropy weight method. At the same time, we analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the coupling coordination degree of the two systems by using the coupling coordination degree model, kernel density curve, spatial autocorrelation model, and Markov transition matrix. The results show that (1) the development level of ER increased steadily while that of GF fluctuated. The coupling coordination degree of the two systems shows an increasing trend. (2) The coupling coordination level of the two systems presents a spatial gradient pattern of “East > Middle > West”. (3) The level of coupling coordination has an obvious spatial correlation. (4) The coupling coordination level in our country remains stable in the future, and there is a possibility of transition to a higher level. The research of this paper provides valuable enlightenment for implementing a sustainable development strategy in China.
