In Kenya, arid and semi-arid lands are more affected by drought due to their fragile ecosystems and unfavorable climate. The main objective of this study was to determine the level of community resilience to drought in Kitui County, based on the conceptual framework of community resilience building to drought. The results indicate that social (F (860.969) =397, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05) and economic factors (F (5316.236) = 397, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05) significantly influenced community resilience to drought; however, environmental factors did not have much effect. The study recommends the need to adopt appropriate strategic policy options for enhancing community resilience to drought through capacity building on successful humanitarian aid interventions. The research findings will be beneficial to policy makers and stakeholders generally to improve strategies for enhancing community resilience to drought against the effects of climate change.
