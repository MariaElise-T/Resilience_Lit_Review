A systematic review was conducted, ranging from the seismic resilience of single slope engineering structures as disaster-bearing bodies to their transformation into disaster-inducing bodies owing to seismic dynamic instability. The resilience of slopes is considered with regard to regional transportation networks, which are most severely threatened by earthquake-induced landslide disasters. For the engineering structure of a single slope as a disaster-bearing body, the stage before the slope engineering loses stability can be considered as the first stage of slope seismic resilience evaluation. This review summarizes the latest progress in seismic resilience evaluation and reinforcement design from the perspective of engineering seismic resilience. In response to the lack of definition for the resilience of existing regional road networks to earthquake-induced landslide impacts during the review, the second stage involves the transformation of the seismic dynamic instability of regional slopes into landslide disasters; resilience is defined as the global system reliability of the regional road network in this study. From the perspective of network reliability, an assessment framework for the resilience of the regional transportation network against seismic landslide disasters is systematically proposed in this study. In accordance with high-dimensional nonlinear network dynamics theory, this paper highlights the future research direction of introducing high-dimensional network dynamics theory into the disaster resilience of regional road networks affected by landslide disasters.
