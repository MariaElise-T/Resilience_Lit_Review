This paper is devoted to solving the technical task of providing cyber resilience utilizing secure routing means in Software-Defined Networks (SDN). The work analyzes the SDN architecture and its main components, the concept of cyber resilience and its means, as well as security issues in SDN. Particular attention is paid to the use of secure routing in software-defined networks. Numerical research of the model of secure multipath routing of fragmented confidential messages in the SDN data plane was conducted. The calculation of the message compromise probability for different values of links compromise probabilities was performed. The obtained results showed that the model of secure multipath routing of fragmented confidential messages with redundancy provides a better balancing of message parts by routes. Results of the numerical study proved the adequacy of the selected secure multipath routing model.
