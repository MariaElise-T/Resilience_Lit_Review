AbstractBackgroundApproximately one‐third of elderly individuals remain cognitively intact, despite substantial Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) neuropathological changes. The exact, molecular underpinnings towards resilience in AD remain to be elucidated. Here, we set out to investigate changes in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex of cognitively intact donors with AD pathology, referred to as resilient, and compare them to AD and control subjects.MethodPost‐mortem tissue of individuals with an intermediate or high AD neuropathological score according to the NIA‐AA, but with intact cognition, AD patients with high pathology and low cognition, and age‐matched controls (i.e. cognitively intact subjects without a neurological or psychological disorders) was obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on RNA isolated from the prefrontal cortex. Several molecular mechanisms of interest were further immunohistochemically confirmed in post‐mortem tissue.ResultAnalysis revealed transcriptional changes between resilient and AD donors including mitochondrial functioning, metallothionein signaling and the Tyrobp network. Additionally, we found profound changes in the extracellular matrix, including changes in perineuronal nets (PNNs) between resilient, AD and control donors. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated altered morphology and a reduction of PNNs in AD while PNNs were more preserved in resilient donors compared to control donors.ConclusionOur data indicates that changes in mitochondria, altered signaling in astrocytes and microglia via metallothionein and Tyrobp, respectively, and preservation of PNNs were associated with intact cognition despite the presence of AD pathology and could ultimately point to novel targets for therapeutic development.
