Aims We sought to evaluate early recovery from rotator cuff repair by assessing the correlation between patient resilience and postoperative shoulder pain and function, and physical and mental health. Methods Patients scheduled to undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were prospectively enrolled. Resilience was assessed using the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), pain and function was measured by American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder scores, and physical and mental health was measured by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health-10 (PROMIS-10). All scores were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively at three- and six months. Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the relationship between variables. Results Ninety-eight patients ultimately underwent rotator cuff repair; 76 and 68 patients provided three- and six-month follow-up, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between preoperative BRS and three- and six-month ASES. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between preoperative BRS and three-month PROMIS-10 (r = 0.3763, p = 0.009) and concurrent BRS and PROMIS-10 at three months (r = 0.5657, p = 0.0025) and six months (r = 0.5308, p = 0.0025). Discussion Resilience appears to be more predictive of global physical and mental health than shoulder pain and function in early recovery from rotator cuff repair.
