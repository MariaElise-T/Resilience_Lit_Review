The increasingly frequent extreme events pose a serious threat to the resilience of the power system. At the same time, the power grid is transforming into a new type of clean and low-carbon power system due to severe environmental issues. The system shows strong randomness with a high proportion of renewable energy, which has increased the difficulty of maintaining the safe and stable operation of the power system. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the resilience of the new power system. This paper first elaborates on the concept of power system resilience, listing the characteristics of new power systems and their impact on grid resilience. Secondly, the evaluation methods for resilient power grids are classified into two categories, and measures to improve the resilience of the new power system are reviewed from various stages of disasters. Then, the critical technologies for improving the resilience of the new power system are summarized. Finally, the prospective research directions for new power system resilience enhancement are expounded.
