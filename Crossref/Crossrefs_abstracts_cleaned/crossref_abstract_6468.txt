AbstractDecentralized delay‐dependent local stability and resilient feedback stabilization methods are developed for a class of linear interconnected continuous‐time systems. The subsystems are time‐delay plants which are subjected to convex‐bounded parametric uncertainties and additive feedback gain perturbations while allowing time‐varying delays to occur within the local subsystems and across the interconnections. The delay‐dependent local stability conditions are established at the subsystem level through the construction of appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. We characterize decentralized linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)‐based delay‐dependent stability conditions by deploying an injection procedure such that every local subsystem is delay‐dependent robustly asymptotically stable with an γ‐level ℒ︁2‐gain. Resilient decentralized state‐feedback stabilization schemes are designed, which takes into account additive gain perturbations such that the family of closed‐loop feedback subsystems enjoys the delay‐dependent asymptotic stability with a prescribed γ‐level ℒ︁2‐gain for each subsystem. The decentralized feedback gains are determined by convex optimization over LMIs. All the developed results are tested on representative examples. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
