Abstract
Resilience promotes positive adaptation to challenges and may facilitate recovery for adolescents experiencing psychopathology. This work examined concordance across the experience, expression, and physiological response to stress as a protective factor that may predict longitudinal patterns of psychopathology and well-being that mark resilience. Adolescents aged 14–17 at recruitment (oversampled for histories of non-suicidal self-injury; NSSI) were part of a three-wave (T1, T2, T3) longitudinal study. Multi-trajectory modeling produced four distinct profiles of stress experience, expression, and physiology at T1 (High-High-High, Low-Low-Low, High-Low-Moderate, and High-High-Low, respectively). Linear mixed-effect regressions modeled whether the profiles predicted depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, NSSI engagement, positive affect, satisfaction with life, and self-worth over time. Broadly, concordant stress response profiles (Low-Low-Low, High-High-High) were associated with resilient-like patterns of psychopathology and well-being over time. Adolescents with a concordant High-High-High stress response profile showed a trend of greater reduction in depressive symptoms (B = 0.71, p = 0.052), as well as increased global self-worth (B = –0.88, p = 0.055), from T2 to T3 compared to the discordant High-High-Low profile. Concordance across multi-level stress responses may be protective and promote future resilience, whereas blunted physiological responses in the presence of high perceived and expressed stress may indicate poorer outcomes over time.
