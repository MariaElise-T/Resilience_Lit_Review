AbstractA city‐scale time–history analysis‐driven framework is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of building seismic resilience and repair scheduling with repair resource constraints. First, a calculation method for the post‐earthquake residual functionality of buildings based on engineering demand parameters is proposed. Second, the repair‐scheduling unit (RSU) concept is proposed for city‐scale repair scheduling. Moreover, two repair priority indices are introduced to evaluate the repair priority of each RSU. Next, the concept of job block is proposed to compute the repair time of an RSU with insufficient repair resources. Subsequently, the workflow of repair simulation is presented to calculate the community recovery curve and resilience index quantitatively. Finally, 68,930 residential buildings of Beijing City's 16 administrative districts are simulated to demonstrate the proposed method. The outcomes of this work are expected to be a useful reference for building seismic resilience evaluation and repair scheduling of communities. Consequently, it could be an aid to pre‐earthquake disaster risk reduction planning and post‐earthquake rapid recovery of building functionalities.
