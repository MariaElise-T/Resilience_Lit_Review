 Research to date on the academic performance of looked after children has tended to concentrate on their consistent and significant underachievement compared to the general population of schoolchildren during the school years. However, some people who have been looked after in local authority care during childhood return to study later in life as mature students. James Mallon's study, reported in this article, identifies protective factors that enabled some participants to develop resilience and achieve academic success, despite many risk factors in their pre-care and care experience.
