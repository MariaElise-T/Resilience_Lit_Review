This research examined the effect of flipped classrooms based on gamification on developing self-regulated learning skills and educational resilience among students of intermediate schools in English language. The research sample included (90) students in the third intermediate grade who were selected from three schools in Jeddah, and they were distributed into three groups, with (30) students in each group. A quasi-experimental design was used to study the effect of using flipped classrooms based on gamification on self-regulated learning skills and educational resilience. The researcher developed a measure for self-regulated learning skills that included (28) phrases distributed over (4) axes, namely: goal setting, planning, monitoring, recitation and memorization, and requesting social assistance. An educational resilience scale was also developed consisting of (30) phrases distributed on (6) axes, namely: flexibility, facing challenges, personal competence, social support, and values. The research experiment was applied for two consecutive weeks in the second semester of the academic year 2021/2022. The research resulted in the development of a motivational design for the flipped classrooms based on (4) motivational elements, namely points, badges, levels, and leaderboards. The research recommended the need to expand the use of flipped classrooms based on gamification and to train teachers to use this strategy.
