ABSTRACTThere is a growing discourse worldwide on the impact of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) on “at risk youths”. In response, five HIV‐positive Nigerian adolescent girls were qualitatively investigated in collaboration with a non‐governmental organisation (NGO) in Ibadan, an urban settlement in Nigeria in 2013. Using a secondary data analysis from a photo voice component of the research, combined with narratives, we show that participants possess the capacity to overcome their adversities from the effects of HIV infection and remain resilient. Few studies have used photovoice − a visual participatory approach − and its impact on this group. The theories of Bourdieu, Piaget and Erikson were used as tools to interpret and document, resilience, social capital and coping among participants. Findings reveal participants frame positive goals, use social competence, coping skills, and express personal challenges. These have serious implications for policy makers, researchers and programmer in strengthening adolescents' resilience.
