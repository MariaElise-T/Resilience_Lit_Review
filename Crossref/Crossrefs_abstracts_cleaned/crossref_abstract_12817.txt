Abstract
Building energy consumptions for space cooling is a globally rising voice. Considering the need to reduce the total energy consumptions and related GHG, alternative solutions based on natural heat sinks are essential. Unfortunately, these technologies, such as passive cooling systems, are vey local specific and their geo-climatic applicability needs to be studied to correctly choose and integrate them since early design phases. The paper studies the distribution of climate-related demand for cooling in the Italian context, by mapping local CDH (Cooling Degree Hours) together with the local potential of ventilative cooling dissipative technologies (e.g. controlled natural ventilation), for present and future climate conditions. A geo-referenced matrix – considering all the 7978 Italian Municipalities – of typical meteorological years will be generated and further analysed on hourly base by developing Python scripts. Results of this analysis are visualized in devoted maps of applicability able to underline the local expected potential of wind-driven ventilative solutions. These maps can act as a reference toolkit for designers considering early-design evaluations. Finally, the expected resilience of local climate-potential of these technologies to climate changes is analysed.
