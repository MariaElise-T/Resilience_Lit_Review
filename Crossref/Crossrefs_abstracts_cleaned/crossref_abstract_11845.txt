Abstract
Addressing the use of ISR structures in conventional operations in the context of national resilience, in an era of unpredictability of the security environment and the current presence of a regional conflict, inevitably becomes a mandatory concern for both support and decision-makers at all hierarchical levels and from all categories of troops. The development of a national defense position can be achieved through a flexible and robust ISR system, permanently adapted to the requirements of modern conflicts. Understanding how ISR capabilities can be used in conventional operations by addressing the principles, disciplines and collection systems is a key element in understanding the contribution of ISR to national resilience.
