The Gerber Resiliency Test is a clinical approach to possible evaluation of compression or distraction in the temporomandibular joints. In this study the same principle was used to check the tendency of mechanical responses of joints to the use of bite‐splints. Sequences of tests were performed on 18 adult patients of the UTHSCSA clinical pool who had been previously treated for splint therapy. From this population nine patients Presented one or more symptoms of TMD and nine were free of symptoms. Separation of the molars wih the use of one thickness of tin foil indicated tendency to compression in the joints and three or four thicknesses to distraction. The tests were performed during delivery of the appliance adn 1 week later. One sample chi‐square statistical test was performed and did not show any statistically significant difference between dysfunction and non‐dysfunction groups (P < .05) At delivery, ther was a higher frequency of distraction in both left and right joints (P < .05) when the splint was inserted. Compression was present at very low frequency. One week later, the joints did not stay distracted in the same frequency.
