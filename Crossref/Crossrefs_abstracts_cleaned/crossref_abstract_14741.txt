PurposeThis study aims to explore the impact of supply chain governance (SCG) on supply chain resilience (SCR) in China, as well as the mediating role of supply chain finance (SCF) and the moderating role of digital technology adoption (DTA).Design/methodology/approachBased on resource orchestration theory (ROT), this paper constructs a theoretical model to examine the influence of SCG on SCR. Employing data collected from 312 Chinese firms, multiple regression is conducted to test the theoretical hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicate that both relational governance (RG) and contractual governance (CG) significantly enhance SCR and SCF. In addition, SCF plays a mediating role in the relationship between SCG and SCR. The study also finds that DTA has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between SCG and SCF.Originality/valueFirst, based on ROT, this paper clarifies the nuanced driving effects of RG and CG on SCR. Second, SCF is introduced as an intermediary process between SCG and SCR, which reveals the inner mechanisms between SCG and SCR. Moreover, this study contributes to investigating the contingent role of DTA in the relationship between SCG and SCF.
