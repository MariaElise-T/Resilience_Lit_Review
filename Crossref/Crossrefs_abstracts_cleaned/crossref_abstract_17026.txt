 Physical, sexual and psychological abuse were examined as risk factors for pregnancy-related anxiety with resilience and social support as mediators. Pregnant women ( n = 638) completed measures of pregnancy-related anxiety, resilience, perceived social support and childhood abuse. Women with an abuse history had higher pregnancy-related anxiety scores ( m = 64.40) than other women ( m = 55.36). All abuse types independently predicted pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience and social support were mediators. Results highlight the value of antenatal screening for pregnancy-related anxiety including specific risk factors such as child abuse. Programs such as the Midwife Continuity of Care are useful in encouraging disclosure.
