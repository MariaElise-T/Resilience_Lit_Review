With the rapid development of urbanization and modernization, people’s requirements for electric power are also consequently increasing. It is thus essential to ensure the sustainable and stable supply of power and maintain the safety performance of the power grid. Constructing a modern safety management system (SMS) can effectively improve power enterprises’ ability to respond to emergencies. To effectively evaluate the ability of electric power enterprises to resist risk impact, and the recovery and optimization ability after impact, this paper makes a systematic investigation of the SMS of power enterprises. It evaluates the safety resilience capabilities of the SMS from four basic elements of stability, redundancy, efficiency, and adaptability. A multilevel evaluation system of electric power enterprises’ safety resilience capacity consists of four first-level and 25 second-level indices. Then, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and matter-element extension (MEE) joint model—the AHP-MEE evaluation model of the resilience capacity of power enterprises—is proposed. A case study of electric power enterprise safety resilience evaluation is conducted using the proposed resilience evaluation index system and assessment model. The results showed that the provided model agrees with the actual situation and verified the index system and model for electric power enterprise safety reliability and applicability. Improved enterprise safety resilience recommendations are proposed accordingly based on the evaluation results. This work proposes a robust safety resilience capacity evaluation method in the face of upcoming new risks, thus building a good working foundation to construct a new power system with new energy sources.
