Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) causes Maedi-Visna or Ovine Progressive Pneumonia in sheep and creates insidious livestock production losses. This retrovirus is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus and currently has no vaccines or cure. Genetic marker assisted selection for sheep disease resiliency presents an attractive management solution. Previously, we identified a region containing a cluster of zinc finger genes that had association with ovine SRLV proviral concentration. Trait-association analysis validated a small insertion/deletion variant near ZNF389 (rs397514112) in multiple sheep breeds. In the current study, 543 sheep from two distinct populations were genotyped at 34 additional variants for fine mapping of the regulatory elements within this locus. Variants were selected based on ChIP-seq annotation data from sheep alveolar macrophages that defined active cis-regulatory elements predicted to influence zinc finger gene expression. We present a haplotype block of variants within regulatory elements that have improved associations and larger effect sizes (up to 4.7-fold genotypic difference in proviral concentration) than the previously validated ZNF389 deletion marker. Hypotheses for the underlying causal mutation or mutations are presented based on changes to in silico transcription factor binding sites. These variants offer alternative markers for selective breeding and are targets for future functional mutation assays.
