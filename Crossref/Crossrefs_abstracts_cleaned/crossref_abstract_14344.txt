Purpose
Resilience can protect against workplace stress, benefit psychological wellbeing and promote effective clinical practice in mental health professionals. The purpose of this study was to consider the feasibility and acceptability of resilience training for trainee mental health professionals based on the skills-based model of personal resilience (Baker et al., 2021). The study also aimed to explore the impact of the training on resilience, wellbeing and burnout.


Design/methodology/approach
In a within-subject 10-week follow-up study, mixed methods were used to evaluate the one-day resilience training for trainee mental health professionals working in services in the UK.


Findings
The intervention was found to be acceptable to attendees, with high levels of satisfaction reported. Resilience was evaluated through self-report measures at three-time points. Resilience scores at follow-up were significantly higher than pre- and post-intervention scores. The secondary outcomes of wellbeing and burnout did not significantly improve.


Research limitations/implications
Preliminary support was found for the feasibility and acceptability of resilience training for trainee mental health practitioners. Audience-specific adaptations and follow-up groups to aid skills practice and implementation may further enhance benefits to resilience. Resilience interventions may supplement practitioner training to improve resilience. Resilience is associated with higher wellbeing and lower burnout. The impact of resilience training on overall wellbeing and burnout remains uncertain; however, newly learned resilience skills may take time to benefit wellbeing.


Originality/value
A key contribution of this study is to provide evidence regarding the feasibility of implementing the skills-based model of personal resilience, outlined in Baker et al. (2021), in a learning environment.
