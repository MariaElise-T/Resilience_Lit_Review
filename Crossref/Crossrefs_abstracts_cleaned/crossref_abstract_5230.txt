This article offers a novel context-based resilience model to identify and discuss the sources of the resilience of event ecosystems in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the study employs a mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to study how event ecosystems
 have evolved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while special attention is given to their adaptability and transformability capacities. A better understanding of how event ecosystems change under unexpected circumstances will promote solutions that strengthen the sector's resilience in a global
 pandemic and the postpandemic reality. Therefore, the research contributes twofold to the existing body of literature on event crisis management. First, it proposes a context-based event ecosystem resilience framework (CEER) to enable a more comprehensive understanding of what makes event
 ecosystems resilient and responsive to the changing environment in which they operate. Second, it takes on a challenge to conduct an empirical investigation of various aspects of the CEER model in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
