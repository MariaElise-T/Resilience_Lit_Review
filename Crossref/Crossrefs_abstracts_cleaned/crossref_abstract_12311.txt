This paper explores the structures of the critical literature on resilience by mapping the ways in which critical trajectories developed and travelled across thematic communities. We use bibliometric analysis to examine 49Â years of scholarship on resilience from international relations, geography, political ecology, and other social science disciplines that foremost focused on questions of power, inequality, and social justice. As a result, this paper delves into the composition of different types of critique mobilised in resilience scholarship and identifies the interdependencies between modes of critical thought and their degree of interdisciplinary connectivity.
