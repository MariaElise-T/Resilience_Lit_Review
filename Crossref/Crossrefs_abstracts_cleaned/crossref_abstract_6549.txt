Background: Previous literature illustrated that nursing students encounter different types of stress during their academic program. However, clinical education stress is the most important one. Few studies have addressed the association between clinical stress and resilience strategies. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to analyze previous research on stress degrees and types of clinical stressors that might be encountered by nursing students. Methods: The authors used the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Google scholar. The forthcoming keywords were utilized: stress, nursing students and clinical practice. Results: It has been indicated that nursing students encountered the following clinical stressors: phobia of interactions with other healthcare providers and fear of committing mistakes. Nursing students utilize resilience for handling stressors successfully. Conclusion: The impact of using resilience on clinical education stress has received little attention in previous literature. This review highlights the relationship between clinical education stress and resilience. Implications for Nursing: The findings of this study give directions for practitioners, teachers and researchers in the nursing clinical education field so as to develop effective teaching programs.
