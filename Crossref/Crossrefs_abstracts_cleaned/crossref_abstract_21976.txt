Visible light communications (VLC) are an emerging technology that is increasingly demonstrating its ability to provide wireless communications in areas where radio frequency (RF) technology might have some limitations. Therefore, VLC systems offer possible answers to various applications in outdoor conditions, such as in the road traffic safety domain, or even inside large buildings, such as in indoor positioning applications for blind people. Nevertheless, several challenges must still be addressed in order to obtain a fully reliable solution. One of the most important challenges is focused on further improving the immunity to optical noise. Different from most works, where on–off keying (OOK) modulation and Manchester coding have been the preferred choices, this article proposes a prototype based on a binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) modulation and non-return-to-zero (NRZ) coding, for which the resilience to noise is compared to that of a standard OOK VLC system. The experimental results showed an optical noise resilience improvement of 25% in direct exposure to incandescent light sources. The VLC system using BFSK modulation was able to maintain a maximum noise irradiance of 3500 µW/cm2 as compared with 2800 µW/cm2 for the OOK modulation, and an improvement of almost 20% in indirect exposure to the incandescent light sources. The VLC system with BFSK modulation was able to maintain the active link in an equivalent maximum noise irradiance of 65,000 µW/cm2, as opposed to the equivalent 54,000 µW/cm2 for the OOK modulation. Based on these results, one can see that based on a proper system design, VLC systems are able to provide impressive resilience to optical noise.
