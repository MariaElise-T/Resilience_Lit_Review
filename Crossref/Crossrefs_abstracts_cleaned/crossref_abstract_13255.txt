 There has been limited South African research to date on family resilience as well as on the resiliency of families living with children diagnosed with AD/HD. We aimed to explore and describe the factors that facilitate adjustment and adaptation in families after a child has been clinically diagnosed with AD/HD. The Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment and Adaptation served as a framework to conceptualize the families' adjustment and adaptation processes. The study was triangular in nature, with an exploratory, descriptive approach. Non-probability purposive sampling was used to gain participants for the study. A biographical questionnaire and seven structured questionnaires were used to gather data. The biographical data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Quantitative data were analysed by means of correlation analysis, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data obtained from the open-ended question on the biographical questionnaire. While the results of the quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis yielded various results, some commonalities can be highlighted; social support, family time and routines, and incendiary (affirmative) communication. The study sample also demonstrated their ability to bounce back from the adversities that previous research consistently highlighted as difficulties in their context. The findings of the research can be incorporated into individual and family level interventions for families living with a child diagnosed with AD/HD.
