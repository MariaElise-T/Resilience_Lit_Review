AbstractKalisch et al. propose that positive reappraisal constitutes a resilience mechanism for highly stressed individuals. Both empirical and theoretical accounts suggest that this claim is too simplistic â€“ the relationship between reappraisal and resilience depends on context. Indeed, there may be contexts in which reappraisal leads to harm, not resilience. Future research should examine multiple regulatory processes as well as context.
