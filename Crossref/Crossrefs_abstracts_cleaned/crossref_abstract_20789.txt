Introduction Resilience aids rapid recovery from substance abuse, prevents the likelihood of relapse, and improves the quality of life of the youths with substance abuse. Objective This study aimed to assess the resilience level and related factors predicting resilience among youths undergoing substance abuse treatment in Thailand. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional design with a simple random sampling technique was used. A total of 430 young substance abusers undergoing treatment were recruited from ten treatment centers in Eastern Thailand from April to June 2021. Data were collected using nine questionnaires: demographic form, resilience questionnaire, Rosenberg self-esteem questionnaire, psychological flexibility for substance abuser questionnaire, cognitive fusion questionnaire, substance abuse self-stigma scale, family connectedness scale, friendship intimacy questionnaire, and personal resource questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze data. Results The results showed a high level of resilience (89.30%) among the youths undergoing substance abuse treatment. The stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the significant factors associated with resilience include self-esteem (β = 0.260, p < .001), psychological flexibility (β = 0.222, p < .001), social support (β = 0.209, p < .000), and family connectedness (β = −0.194, p < .001). All the variables collectively explained 26.9% of the variance for resilience among the youths with substance abuse ( R2 = .269, p < .001). Conclusion Determining resilience and its related factors among the youths undergoing substance abuse treatment is significant as it guides the formulation of the substance abuse treatment programs, improves mental health and quality of life, and prevents relapse.
