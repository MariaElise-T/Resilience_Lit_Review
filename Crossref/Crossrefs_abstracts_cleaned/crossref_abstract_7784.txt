This quasi-experimental pilot study examined the impact of multidisciplinary care, with a particular focus on occupational therapy (OT), on resilience in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Individuals with a diagnosis of MS who were receiving multidisciplinary care including outpatient OT at an MS center were invited to participate. A total of 36 individuals agreed to enroll and were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and the Resilience Scale (RS). After an 8-week period of multidisciplinary treatment, the 35 individuals who completed treatment were again asked to complete the RS. As a group they demonstrated statistically significant improvement in resilience. A cohort of participants unexpectedly did not follow through with OT but did follow through with their other referrals. These individuals completed the RS before and after the 8-week time period and became an ad hoc control group. The group receiving OT showed significant improvement in resilience, while the control group did not. This study shows that a multidisciplinary approach to care, especially when it includes OT, is effective in treating individuals with MS. Occupational therapy focuses on treating symptoms that specifically limit daily functioning and participation, and may be uniquely positioned to affect resilience. Because resilience plays an important role in functional recovery and maintenance, this study suggests that OT may be a critical component of MS care in developing characteristics that enhance resilience.
