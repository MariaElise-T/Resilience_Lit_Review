Objectives: To examine the level of resilience among the frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in four different Southeast Asian jurisdictions and identify the potential factors that may enhance healthcare workers resilience.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among 3,048 eligible healthcare workers in Hong Kong, Nepal, Vietnam, and Taiwan from May 2021 to July 2022, and information on individual resilience, socio-demographic characteristics, organizational supports, and personal exposures were collected. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors that were associated with a high resilience level.Results: The resilience score was the highest among healthcare workers of Vietnam, followed by Taiwan and Hong Kong, with Nepal scoring the lowest. Participants with old age, part-time work, higher education level, more satisfaction with workplace policy, better organizational supports, and fewer COVID-specific worries were associated with higher resilience. Healthcare workers who were satisfied with the overall organizational policy support had an OR of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.25â€“1.76) for a high resilience level.Conclusion: Implementing satisfying organizational policies and establishing supportive work environments for frontline healthcare workers can increase individual resilience and organizational stability.
