Rural farmers, especially those with limited resources, are on the frontline of the climate crisis. In the Caribbean, vulnerability of agri-food systems to climatic disturbances is recognized, but empirical evidence detailing effective adaptation strategies remains patchy. In Jamaica, a combination of challenges—ranging from diminishing availability of arable land and stagnant agricultural innovation to the marginalization of small-scale farming and recurrent climatic shocks—has led to significant agricultural setbacks and socioeconomic distress for local farmers. This case study is based on a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data derived from a climate adaptation initiative in Peckham, Clarendon, a pivotal agricultural hub in Jamaica. The data acquisition methodologies encompassed livelihood baseline assessments, community engagement surveys, training workshops, and focus group discussions. Synthesis of data from 31 agricultural training sessions and 16 climate-smart agriculture workshops, involving 458 farmers, offers cogent evidence of the initiative’s tangible impacts on the Peckham farming community. The initiative was guided by two core objectives: (1) enhancing food security and rural livelihoods through the implementation of a renewable energy-powered aquaponics framework, and (2) improving land and water resource management practices. To achieve these goals, the Farmer-Field School approach was employed to promote climate-smart agricultural practices and strengthen the institutional capabilities of farming groups. The insights from the assessment underscore the potential of integrated climate-resilient agricultural practices in addressing both economic and environmental challenges faced by rural farmers.
