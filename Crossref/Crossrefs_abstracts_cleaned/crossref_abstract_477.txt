Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic medical condition that can negatively impact both physical and psychological health. Diabetes resilience can be protective against the physical and social/emotional consequences among children with T1D yet few studies have examined the ability to increase resiliency in the pediatric population. Forty children with T1D (Age 14.1±2.3 years, 48% female, Hba1c 12.0±1.6%) were enrolled in a 4-month multi-disciplinary intervention that included medical management, Psychology-led motivational interviewing, and frequent support from a Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialist (CDCES). Participants completed the Diabetes Strengths and Resilience (DSTAR) measure at baseline and post-intervention. The DSTAR is a validated assessment tool aimed to assess both self and parent reported measures of general and diabetes-related child self-efficacy and level of perceived support, as well as diabetes distress. HbA1c was assessed at baseline and 4 months. At baseline, higher DSTAR scores were associated with lower HbA1c (r=-0.34, p=0.03). DSTAR scores increased significantly in response to the intervention from 43.9±6.4 to 47.2±6.9 at 4 months (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, HbA1c significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention (12.0±1.6% to 11.0±1.9%, p&lt;0.001). A multifaceted approach to children with diabetes can improve levels of resilience, a factor involved in improving and maintaining both physical and psychological health.
