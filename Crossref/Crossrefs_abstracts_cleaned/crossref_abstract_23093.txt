 A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal in 2015, followed by hundreds of aftershocks that led to physical destruction, loss, and negative mental health outcomes. Yet, in the days, months, and years following the disaster, numerous forms of community art rose from the rubble, such as urban murals, spoken word poetry, public dance performances, and sacred art. This study explored the relationship between community art and health, social cohesion, and community resilience in postearthquake Nepal. We utilized photography and audio recorders to capture 19 unique artworks/projects created in the aftermath of the earthquake and conducted in-depth interviews with 19 artists and/or experts about the relationship between art and health in postdisaster contexts. The 19 postearthquake artworks/projects ranged from contemporary paintings to Buddhist ritual dance and reflected the unique combination of the traditional and contemporary necessary for salvaging and restoring Nepali heritage. Findings revealed three key themes regarding linkages between art and mental health in the context of postearthquake Nepal. First, community art offers relief and is a mechanism for coping, through the creation or observation of art. Second, community art can be used as a means of communication, both as a tool for promoting connections and conversations in the community and by communicating messages of hope. Third, community art can promote community cohesion and ultimately serve as a tool to create physical and emotional safe spaces. Overall, there is promise for initiatives that engage artists and communities in arts-based initiatives following traumatic events, such as natural disasters, which can positively affect health. Funding support and development of partnerships with grassroots artists and creators should be promoted in health and development programming, especially for risk reduction and recovery after disasters.
