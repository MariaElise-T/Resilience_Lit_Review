Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a stressful event that engenders psychological distress. This study examines the prospective effects of coping strategies during hospitalization on resilience and on various mental-health dimensions at five months after transplantation. Methods. One hundred and seventy patients (Mage = 52.24, SD = 13.25) completed a questionnaire assessing adjustment strategies during hospitalization, and 91 filled out a questionnaire five months after HSCT (Mage = 51.61, SD = 12.93). Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that a fighting spirit strategy positively predicted resilience (p < 0.05), whereas anxious preoccupations predicted anxiety (p < 0.05), poorer mental QoL (p < 0.01), and were associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD (OR = 3.27, p < 0.01; 95% CI: 1.36, 7.84) at five months after transplantation. Hopelessness, avoidance, and denial coping strategies were not predictive of any of the mental health outcomes. Finally, the number of transplantations was negatively related to a fighting spirit (p < 0.01) and positively related to hopelessness-helplessness (p < 0.001): Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of developing psychological interventions focused on coping to alleviate the negative psychological consequences of HSCT.
