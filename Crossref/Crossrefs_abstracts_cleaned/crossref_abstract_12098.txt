Given the pressures that exist in our health care system, health care professionals often are under significant stress to provide both quality clinical care to patients and quality teaching to their learners. We present an innovative program to develop faculty and health professional  skills in reflective practice and resilience, which strengthen participants' ability to act as effective clinicians, educators, role models, and leaders. The basis of the curriculum  rests in the neuroscience of mindfulness  and its applications. This program was enabled through a unique partnership between acute care hospitals (Hamilton Health Sciences and St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton), Family Health Teams (McMaster Family Health Team and Hamilton Family Health Team) and the McMaster Faculty of Health Sciences Program for Faculty Development (PFD), with additional funding support in 2013 from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOH-LTC). Data from 2013 course participants (validated measurement  tools and qualitative feedback) was analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative. This poster outlines the journey of this work and a summary of the data gathered to inform further education.
