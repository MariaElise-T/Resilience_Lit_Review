Existing secondary control methods using fault-tolerant and/or Hâˆž control techniques for multi-inverter microgrids generally assume bounded faults and/or disturbances. Herein, we study unknown unbounded attacks on the input channels of both frequency and voltage control loops of inverters that could deteriorate the cooperative performance and affect the microgrid stability. We propose a fully distributed attack-resilient control framework using adaptive control techniques that, using stability analysis with Lyapunov techniques, are shown to preserve the uniformly ultimately bounded consensus for frequency regulation and voltage containment. Moreover, the ultimate bound can be set by adjusting the tuning parameters. The proposed result is validated for a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder benchmark system augmented with four inverters.
