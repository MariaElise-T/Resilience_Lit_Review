(1) Background: Resilience research began in the child population as a validity scale to describe children’s psychological wellbeing and ability to cope with negative events, and to some extent, to predict recovery and adaptation when they experience adversity again. In view of the important developmental implications of resilience in young children and the lack of a Chinese children’s resilience scale, this study developed a resilience scale for young Chinese children based on a systematic review of existing international resilience scales and the characteristics of the Chinese cultural background. (2) Methods: The scale was developed by referring to existing scales, expert interviews, item collation and item finalization, developing original items, then deleting and determining items through item analysis, and finally, comparing with existing scales to obtain the internal and external validity of this scale. (3) Results: The results showed that the scale has good measurement properties, internal consistency reliability, and internal and external validity. (4) Conclusions: Through the development and validation of the Resilience Scale for young children in China, the scale can be used to measure the resilience of young children in China.
