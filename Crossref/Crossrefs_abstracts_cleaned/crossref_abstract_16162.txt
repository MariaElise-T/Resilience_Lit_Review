Background: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of short-term group logo-therapy on life expectancy and resilience of women with breast cancer.
Methods: This applied study is quasi-experimental and was designed by the use of pre-test and post-test. The population of study included all women with breast cancer, from which 30 women with breast cancer were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. To collect study data, The life expectancy scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS) were used. For data analysis, covariance analysis ANCOVA was used.
Results: The results showed that there is a significant difference between the scores of life expectancy between groups F= 485.012, p= 0.005 and there is a significant difference between the mean scores of resilience among groups F= 2.051, P= 0.001.
Conclusions: In general, it can be said that, group logo-therapy can help women with breast cancer to find meaning in their life, receive support from groups, and adapt themselves with diseases. Also, logo-therapy can be useful in breast cancer patientâ€™s attitude towards hardships and problems and can increase their strength and resilience.
