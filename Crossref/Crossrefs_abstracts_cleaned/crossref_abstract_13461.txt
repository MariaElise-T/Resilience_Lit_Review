This study analyzes the role of women in climate resilience building and sustainable farming practices in Nigeria. The country's heavy reliance on agriculture and its vulnerability to climate change make it imperative to understand and enhance women's participation in these areas. Through a systematic review of literature, this research provides insights into the different levels of women's involvement in climate resilience building and sustainable farming practices. Women's contributions include knowledge and skills, natural resource management, community resilience, and education and awareness. However, women face challenges such as limited access to resources, gender-based discrimination, and exclusion from decision-making processes. Women's leadership in sustainable farming practices is crucial for global food security and sustainable development. Gender-inclusive policies and strategies are crucial for building climate resilience, as they acknowledge the unique challenges women face due to existing gender inequalities. Enhancing women's access to financing, training, and agricultural extension services is essential for gender equality and empowering women in the agricultural sector. The findings emphasize the importance of gender perspectives in addressing climate change impacts and highlight the vulnerabilities faced by women in Nigeria. Recommendations for policymakers, organizations, and stakeholders include developing gender-inclusive policies, providing access to financing, strengthening capacity-building initiatives, improving access to agricultural extension services, promoting women's leadership and representation, and fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. This study highlights the significant role of women in climate resilience building and sustainable farming practices in Nigeria and calls for their enhanced participation and empowerment in these areas.
