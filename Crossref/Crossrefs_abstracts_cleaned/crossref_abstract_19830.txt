AbstractResilience is a potential human psycho‐social ability that can reduce negative emotion and promote adaptation to adversity. Most previous studies on resilience have highlighted positive factors for patients with chronic illnesses; however, very few focus on the resilience of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) using a qualitative approach. Using Q‐methodology, we identified the perceptions of resilience of patients undergoing PD. We recruited 33 Korean participants undergoing PD in a university hospital, and classified 37 Q‐samples into a 9‐point normal distribution grid. Collected data were analyzed using the PC‐QUANL program. The perceived subjectivity of the resilience of Korean patients undergoing PD was categorized as three factors: “support‐based acceptance,” “gloomy isolation,” and “active life‐oriented.” The three factors explained 47.4% of the total variance. The eigenvalues were 9.99, 3.40, and 2.26, respectively. These findings suggest that a differentiated approach is needed for interventions to enhance the resilience of patients undergoing PD. This study highlights that clinical nurses and health professionals should understand the perceptions of resilience of patients undergoing PD, and consider their viewpoints in the caring and treatment process.
