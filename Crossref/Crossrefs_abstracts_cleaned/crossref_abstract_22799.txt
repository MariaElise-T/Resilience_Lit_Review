 Despite research demonstrating the health promoting effects of social support, few studies have examined the moderating effect of functional social support on everyday unfair treatment for migrant communities. This study investigates whether functional social support moderates the association between unfair treatment and poor self-rated health for Irish migrants to the UK. Analysis of a purposive sample of Irish migrants in London was conducted ( n = 790). Interaction was analyzed via hierarchical logistic regression. Irish migrants who perceived unfair treatment were over three times more likely to report fair/poor health (odds ratio = 3.47, 95% confidence interval = 2.0–6.02). Higher levels of support in times of crisis were associated with reduced poor health. Higher levels of instrumental or practical support from neighbors moderated against the negative effect of unfair treatment on self-rated health (odds ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = 0.08–0.96) and had a protective stabilizing effect. Instrumental support may have a protective-enhancing effect for female migrants. Results support other studies which indicate that instrumental support is most influential in the context of adversity. Interventions that promote neighborhood social capital may build resilience to unfair treatment for migrant communities in large cities.
