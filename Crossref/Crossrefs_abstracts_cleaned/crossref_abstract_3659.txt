The logistics sector is undergoing a sustainable and resilient transformation guided by the concepts of green supply chain management (GSCM) and supply chain resilience (SCR). While the existing literature posits ICT technologies as individual enablers that enhance organizational performance in areas like sustainable operations, resource economization and organizational resilience, a gap remains in comprehending the nuanced role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in linking GSCM and SCR outcomes. This research delves into how top management perceives the alignment of ICT adoption with GSCM and SCR objectives within logistics firms. Data were gathered from 53 managers in Greek logistics firms. After utilizing factor analysis, the findings indicate that (1) a significant correlation exists between GSCM/SCR states and ICT adoption; (2) firms with higher ICT adoption rates more effectively address GSCM and SCR challenges; and (3) notably, larger firms with more resources have a slight edge over smaller counterparts with less focus on ICT. Policymakers and industry leaders in the logistics sector can leverage these insights to prioritize ICT-related initiatives, especially in regions with similar contexts to Greece.
