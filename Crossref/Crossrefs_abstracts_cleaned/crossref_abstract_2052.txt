A wide-scale outdoor remote deployment involves a large number of low-cost nodes that are powered by green energy, such as solar. We deal with such a system for landslide monitoring where the tiny nodes with ultra-low memory as little as 2 KB are directly connected to the Internet using cellular networks, thereby constituting Cellular IoT’s (C-IoT). This makes them vulnerable to a wide range of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks during their collaborative communications. Further, due to memory constraints, the nodes are not able to run resource-hungry security algorithms. Existing IoT protocols also cannot offer resiliency to DoS attacks for these memory-constrained devices. This paper proposes the Voice Response Internet of Things (VRITHI), which addresses the above issues by using the voice channel between the nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the IoT domain where both the voice and data channels are being used for collaborative communications. Evaluation results demonstrate that VRITHI is able to reduce external DoS attacks from 82–65% to less than 28% and improves real-time communications in such a memory-constrained environment. In addition, it also contributes to green IoT energy saving by more than 50% in comparison with other IoT protocols.
