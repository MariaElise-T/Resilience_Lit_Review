Urban resilience, which has emerged as an important concept in cities since sustainability became a 21st-century urban paradigm, reflects the needs of the times to change and bring about a shift in existing national landscape architecture and social policies. To explore the characteristics of recognition of college students majoring in landscape architecture towards the concept of urban resilience before and after the beginning of COVID-19, this study aims to answer three research questions: to analyzes recognitions of landscape architecture majoring students on urban resilience (research question 1); to compare the differences that emerge from before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (research question 2); and to explore latent classes according to the education pattern (research question 3). The results of this study are as follows: First, before the beginning of COVID-19, four latent classes were drawn up in relation to awareness of the concept of urban resilience, while three latent classes were examined after the start of the pandemic. Before the beginning of COVID-19, students of landscape architecture accepted the concept of urban resilience as a physical and environmental approach to overcome risk factors by creating landscape architecture and infrastructure or applying the concept of resilience in urban development and redevelopment. However, after the beginning of COVID-19, they mostly have been recognized urban resilience as a concept related to technological ability. Thirdly, the grades and educational experiences of the students were found to have a significant effect on the probability of their belonging to a specific latent class.
