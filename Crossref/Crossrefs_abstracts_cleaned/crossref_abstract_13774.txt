 
The objective of this study was to analyse the status quo of the psychological resilience of junior nurses and its influencing factors, so as to provide psychological guidance for junior nurses to enable them to serve clinics better. For the study sample, 152 junior nurses from a tertiary hospital in Linfen City, Shanxi Province, China, were selected by convenience sampling. The junior nurses were investigated by using a general information questionnaire, the Mental Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and a simple coping style scale. The results showed that the overall level of psychological resilience of junior nurses was 58.73 ± 11.07, which was lower than the norm in China. Among the measures of three dimensions of resilience, the score of tenacity was 29.64 ± 6.12; the score of self-improvement was 21.07 ± 5.56; and the score of optimism was 9.32 ± 3.48. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, educational level and coping style were the significant influencing factors of psychological resilience. In conclusion, the level of psychological resilience of the junior nurses in the study was low. Thus, hospital managers should provide a supportive clinical learning environment for the younger nurses. At the same time, they should strengthen the positive coping mechanism of junior nurses, guiding them to use the positive side of psychological resilience.
