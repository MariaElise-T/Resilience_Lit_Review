Introduction:The differential impact and needs of women during disasters are highlighted in contemporary research, there is limited understanding of the distinctive contribution they make and the ways they cope. Women are the key drivers of livelihood, therefore, the economic losses resulting from natural hazards may have massive impacts on their mental health. This study examines how the self-help women's groups in rural Nepalese communities provide economic, social, socio-political, and public-health support to build safer, sustainable, and resilient communities.Method:In-depth open-ended interviews were conducted between January 2021–April 2021 with grassroots women leaders(n=8) representing their (women’s/mother’s) group inquiring about their activities related to risk reduction and perspectives on how they cope during natural hazards. The findings were analyzed and discussed using two analytical frameworks namely, the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) and Bronfenbrenner’s Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) as scaffolds. Data analysis followed the thematic analysis technique.Results:Two major themes emerged from the in-depth interviews: 1) Women are doing their part and 2) Help-seeking behavior as a barrier and facilitator. The traditional female household roles such as cooking, feeding, and caring during pre-disaster states are extended to rescuing, protecting, laborious cleaning, and providing physical and emotional support during disasters. The pre-and post-disaster care responsibility and help-seeking behavior have implications for health, safety, well-being and sustainability. The findings also suggest the inevitability of self-care for women during and post-disasters.Conclusion:The care roles of women involve both livelihood and health benefits for the family and the entire community. To mitigate the physical and mental health burden for women amplified during natural hazards, self-care should be a critical component of advocacy in disaster awareness campaigns and help-seeking behavior should be promoted as a strength rather than insufficiency.
