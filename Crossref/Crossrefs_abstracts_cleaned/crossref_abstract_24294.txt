AbstractBackgroundResilience represents the capacity to adapt to adversity. Resilience can improve following behavioral interventions. We examined lung transplant candidates’ resilience as a novel predictor using the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (RISC‐10).MethodsWaitlisted candidates at six centers were mailed questionnaires from 9/16/2015 to 10/1/2019. Follow‐up surveys were collected annually and post‐transplant. Outcomes were recorded through February 17, 2020. Primary outcome was pre‐transplant death/delisting. Analyses included t test or chi‐square for group comparisons, Pearson's correlation coefficients for strength of relationships, and Cox proportional‐hazard models to evaluate associations with outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and mood.ResultsParticipation was 55.3% (N = 199). Baseline RISC‐10 averaged 32.0 ± 5.6 and did not differ by demographics, primary transplant diagnosis, or disease severity markers. RISC‐10 did not correlate to the commonly utilized Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplant [PACT] or Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation [SIPAT] tools. Scores < 26.3 (representing > 1 standard deviation below population average) occurred in 16% and were associated with pre‐transplant death or delisting, adjusted Hazard Ratio of 2.60 (95% Confidence Interval 1.23‐5.77; P = .01).ConclusionOne in six lung candidates had low resilience, predicting increased pre‐transplant death/delisting. RISC‐10 did not correlate with PACT or SIPAT; resilience may represent a novel risk factor.
