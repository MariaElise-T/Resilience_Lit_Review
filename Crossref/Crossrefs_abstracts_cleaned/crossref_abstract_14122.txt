Planning is considered one of the most important policy instruments for building resilience in urban systems. As an emerging trend, cities in China are starting to incorporate urban resilience-related statements into the new versions of their all-in-one spatial plans, known commonly as territorial plans. This research used a content analysis approach to examine resilience visions and actions in up-to-date comprehensive territorial plans prepared by major Chinese cities. The study results show that while different cities understand the concept of urban resilience in different ways, most cities devise resilience actions that fit into four categories, in descending order as follows: infrastructure and facilities, safety and security, protection and mitigation, and governance and management. This paper further argues that territorial plans in China tend to view resilience more as a synonym for structural soundness and recovery efficiency than as a prospect of broader urban change leading to overall social and economic betterment. The research contributes to explaining ongoing international resilience planning practices and helping planners make more thoughtful plans.
