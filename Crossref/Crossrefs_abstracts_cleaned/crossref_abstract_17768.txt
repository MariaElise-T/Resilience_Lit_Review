BackgroundMedicine is a challenging career. There are reports of high rates of exhaustion, burn out and maladaptive coping strategies amongst doctors, GPs in particular. Accordingly, the issue of GP resilience is extremely topical.AimTo explore perspective of GPs and GP registrars regarding what can be done to promote resilience.MethodThis was a qualitative study involving face-to-face, semi-structured, recorded interviews with GPs and GP registrars in the West of Ireland. Data analysis was done by six stages of thematic analysis based on Braun and Clarke.ResultsThree major themes emerged from data analysis: a) Within the person, b) Within the profession and society, and c) Within the healthcare system. Subthemes within the person were ‘What resilience means to me’, ‘Me as a doctor’ and ‘Me as a human’. Within the profession and society, the subthemes were ‘Traditional view of GP’, ‘Societal expectations of the GP’, ‘Formal supports’ and ‘Education and training’. The healthcare system theme incorporated three subthemes ‘Finances’, ‘Manpower’ and ‘Relationship with the healthcare system’.ConclusionIdentifying means to promote resilience in GPs involves an in-depth understanding of the challenges to resilience at various levels. From this research, it is evident that there is no “one size fits all” with regard to promoting resilience at a personal level. Views differed as to where resilience training would be best placed regarding formal resilience education. As to solutions within the health care system, GPs need to be adequately resourced to meet the evolving demands of general practice.
