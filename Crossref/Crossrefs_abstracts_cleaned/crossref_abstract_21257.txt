AbstractBackgroundPatients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show lower resilience than healthy controls (HCs), associated with greater symptom severity and worse quality of life. However, little is known about affected markers of resilience or the influence of sex. Furthermore, as resilience is complex, a comprehensive assessment, with multiple resilience measures, is needed. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate perceived and relative resilience and their neural correlates in men and women with IBS.MethodsIn 402 individuals (232 IBS [73.3% women] and 170 HCs [61.2% women]), perceived resilience was assessed by the Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRISC) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS); relative resilience was assessed by the standardized residual of the Short Form‐12 mental component summary score predicted by the Adverse Childhood Experiences score. Non‐rotated partial least squares analysis of region‐to‐region resting‐state connectivity data was used to define resilience‐related signatures in HCs. Disease and sex‐related differences within these signatures were investigated.Key ResultsScores on all resilience measures were lower in IBS than in HCs (p's < 0.05). In all three resilience‐related signatures, patients with IBS showed reduced connectivity largely involving the central autonomic network (p's < 0.001). Men with IBS showed lower CDRISC scores than women with IBS, and greater reductions in CDRISC‐related connectivity, associated with worse symptom severity (p < 0.05).Conclusions and InferencesIndividuals with IBS show reduced perceived and relative resilience, with reduced connectivity suggesting impaired homeostasis maintenance. Men with IBS may show additional impairment in specific aspects of resilience. Treatments aimed at improving resilience may benefit patients with IBS, especially men with IBS.
