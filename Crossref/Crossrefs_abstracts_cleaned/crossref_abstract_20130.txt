A natural gas pipeline system (NGPS), as a crucial energy transportation network, exhibits intricate systemic characteristics. Both uncertain disturbances and complex characteristics result in higher requirement of supply safety. The investigation into NGPS resilience addresses the constraints of pipeline integrity and reliability, centering around the vulnerability, robustness, and recovery of an NGPS. Based on a literature review and practical engineering insights, the generalized concept of NGPS resilience is elucidated. The research methodologies of NGPS resilience are classified into three types: indicator construction method, process analysis method, and complex networks method. The practical applications of NGPS resilience research are analyzed, which are based on NGPS operation safety, information safety, and market safety. The ongoing applications and detailed measures are also concluded, which can guide the researchers and engineers from NGPS resilience.
