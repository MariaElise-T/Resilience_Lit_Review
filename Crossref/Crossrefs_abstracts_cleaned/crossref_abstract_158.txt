PurposeWork–family conflict (WFC) is a chronic source of stress, threatening contemporary organizations. Employees' own characteristics, which have received limited scientific attention, can help mitigate WFC. The current two studies tested, for the first time, the links of higher-order trait resilience models to WFC, while exploring possible mediators and differentiating the contributions of interpersonal vs. intrapersonal resilient traits.Design/methodology/approachIn study 1, the authors tested a mediation model in which trait negotiation resilience (TNR), which is oriented toward challenges that involve balancing conflicting needs with others, predicted multidimensional (time, strain and behavior based) WFC, through three mediators: emotion regulation (intrapersonal), self-monitoring and work–family balance negotiation (both interpersonally oriented). In study 2, both TNR and the more intrapersonal Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were associated with a global, more parsimonious measurement of WFC. Additionally, TNR's factors were separately correlated with the latter.FindingsTNR associated with lower multidimensional WFC through emotion regulation, which partly mediated TNR's effect; and through self-monitoring, which suppressed TNR's effect because it related to higher WFC (balance negotiation had no effect). In study 2, CD-RISC, but not TNR, related to lower global WFC. Additionally, two intrapersonal TNR factors tended to relate to lower WFC, while one interpersonal factor related to higher WFC.Originality/valueThe studies demonstrate the role of higher-order trait resilience in WFC, while fine-tuning understanding of the contributions of intrapersonal vs. interpersonal resilience. The findings may be relevant to other organizational challenges, beyond WFC, and inform employee recruitment and training.
