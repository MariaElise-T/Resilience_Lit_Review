The paper analyzes the constructive and usable characteristics of resilient wheels with rubber blocks and rubber "V" ring used on light railway vehicles in urban traffic conditions in order to reduce vibration and noise. These vibrations and noise have an impact on passenger comfort and create serious problems for buildings and residents near city transit lines. The sources of noise generated by train wheels due to their vibrations and possible ways of transmitting noise caused by wheel/rail interaction are stated. The paper examines and analyzes the results of previous research that have give contribution to a better understanding and adoption of the resilient wheel structure and rubber parameters in order to achieve the best noise and vibration reduction effects. Through the paper, it was found that resilient wheels can effectively reduce the rolling noise of wheel on the track by a value of 3[dB] and significantly reduce ground vibrations in a certain frequency range.
