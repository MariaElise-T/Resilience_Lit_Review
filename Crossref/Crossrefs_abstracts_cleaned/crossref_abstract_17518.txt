AbstractAimEarly interventions have great impact on reducing burden of mental illness. Young people are however the least likely to seek help for psychological issues. Resilience and stigma towards mental illness have been identified as contributing factors, although previous findings were mixed with potentially complex interaction with symptom severity. We investigated the relationship between stigma, resilience, depressive symptom severity, and help‐seeking behaviours in undergraduate students in Hong Kong.MethodsA cross‐sectional online survey was conducted among undergraduates from a university in Hong Kong (n = 945). The 21‐item Stigma and Acceptance Scale, Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 were used. History of help‐seeking for psychological issues was self‐reported. Path analysis was conducted to test a conceptual model of their relationships.ResultsAmong those with moderate‐to‐severe depressive symptoms (39.5%), only one‐fourth had sought professional help. The path model showed that depressive symptom severity and stigma were positively associated with help‐seeking behaviours, while resilience was negatively associated with help‐seeking behaviours independently (allp < .001). Subgroup analyses showed differential contribution of stigma and resilience to a history of help‐seeking in those with minimal‐to‐mild symptoms compared with moderate‐to‐severe symptoms.ConclusionsStigma may be a barrier for help‐seeking particularly in students with moderate‐to‐severe depression. Higher levels of resilience in young people may be protective and reduce the unnecessary seeking of professional help. Therefore, enhancing resilience among students in general, and reducing stigma and promoting help‐seeking behaviours for those who have moderate‐to‐severe symptoms should be consider in parallel as strategies to enhance mental wellbeing of students.
