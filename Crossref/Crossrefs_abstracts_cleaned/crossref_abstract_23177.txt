Objectives  The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between teacher efficacy, school climate, resilience, and teacher burnout in elementary school teachers, and to examine the mediating effect of resilience.
Methods  341 elementary school teachers nationwide answered the questionnaire, of which 300 data were analyzed. All data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 18.0 and AMOS 18.0. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics analysis, internal consistency reliability test, Pearson correlation analysis, SEM(Structural Equation Modelling) analysis, and bootstrapping analysis were performed. The statistical significance level was set to .05.
Results  First, Teacher efficacy negatively affected teacher burnout. Second, school climate negatively affected teacher burnout. Third, Resilience negatively affected teacher burnout. Fourth, Resilience mediated the relationship between teacher efficacy and teacher burnout. Fifth, Resilience mediated the relationship between school climate and teacher burnout. These findings emphasize the importance of resilience in the process of teacher efficacy and school climate affecting teacher burnout. Therefore, in order to prevent and alleviate teacher burnout, measures to improve teacher efficacy or school climate should consider enhancing resilience together.
