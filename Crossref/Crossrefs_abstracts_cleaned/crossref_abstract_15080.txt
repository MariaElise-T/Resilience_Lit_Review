The research established the relationships between resilient coping, subjective well-being, subjective happiness, and social support on anxiety levels, depression, and perceived stress among Colombians during the COVID-19 pandemic in the department of CÃ³rdoba, Colombia. Participants were 997 elderly people of both genders with literacy skills and without the presence of cognitive impairment. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), the Happiness Scale (SHS), the Subjective Wellness Scale (SWLS), the Duke-UNC 12 social support scale, the PHQ-4 scale (anxiety-depression), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) were used as measuring instruments. We worked with a nonexperimental cross-sectional design and a correlative scope.
