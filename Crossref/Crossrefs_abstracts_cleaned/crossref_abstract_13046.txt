At the present stage of geopolitical confrontation, the resilience of the political system of the EU is based on the position that the formation of a single social and institutional space allows EU member states to compete more successfully within the global economic system. In the practice of supranational regulation of economic integration, a set of methodological approaches has developed today, where the central place is occupied by the principles of removing barriers to trade within the integration bloc and to the implementation of agreed economic specialization. The most important competitive advantage of regional economic integration is the growth of the global competitiveness of the most efficient enterprises and sectors of the economy of the EU member states due to the spatial expansion of sales markets and the growth of trade.
This book summarizes that the only way to integrate in the current conditions remains integration at different speeds, with an individual approach to each new participating country. The end result of the concept of Europe at different speeds is the accession of all participating countries to the leading group, since all members of the integration group pursue common goals and wish to achieve them by common efforts. The sooner all participating countries find themselves in the same plane of economic and political coordinates, the sooner the set goals will be achieved and key tasks will be solved.
