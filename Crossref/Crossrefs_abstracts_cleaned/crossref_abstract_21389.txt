In this article, a resilient consensus analysis of fractional-order nonlinear leader and follower systems with input and distributed delays is assumed. To make controller design more practical, it is considered that the controller is not implemented as it is, and a disturbance term is incorporated into the controller part. A multi-agent system’s topology ahead to a weighted graph which may be directed or undirected is used. The article examines a scenario of leader–follower consensus through the application of algebraic graph theory and the fractional-order Razumikhin method. Numerical simulations are also provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed design for the leader–follower consensus.
