The present study examined the relationship between stressors, resilience resources, and well‐being in adolescents with low socio‐economic status in Malaysia. The specific aims were: (i) to differentiate between resilient and non‐resilient adolescents in terms of their resilience resources; and (ii) to examine the role of resilience resources on the relationship between stressors and well‐being. In a sample of 197 adolescents aged 12–16 years (mean = 13.77, sd = 1.49), results of the k‐mean clustering technique identified 37.5% of the adolescents as resilient (high stressor, high well‐being), 31.0% as maladjusted (high stressor, low well‐being), and the rest, adapted (low stressor, high well‐being). Resilient adolescents were found to have significantly higher scores on all the identified resilience resources (personality, mother–child communication, social support, school coherence, and teacher support) compared to the non‐resilient maladjusted group. Results of structural equation modelling also showed that these resilience resources acted both as mediator and moderator in the relationship between stressors and well‐being. These findings are discussed with respect to the current literature on resilience and well‐being.
