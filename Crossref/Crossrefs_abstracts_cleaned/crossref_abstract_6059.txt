The present study investigates the relationship between academic resilience and academic achievement for Moroccan university students during the Covid19 pandemic. Additionally, it explores potential interactions of gender and level of studies with academic resilience in the same sample. Academic resilience was measured via the ARS-30 in a sample of 138 graduate and undergraduate students, while academic achievement was measured using the participants&rsquo; GPA in the year of the pandemic. The results indicate that, for the whole sample, students demonstrate resilient behavior. However, high achievers showed more academic resilience than low achievers. There was no significant relationship between gender, level of studies, and academic resilience for the sample studied.
