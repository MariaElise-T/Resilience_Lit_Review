 This study examined the psychometric properties of the Ego Resiliency Scale-Revised (ER89-R). Though support exists for a multidimensional conceptualisation using classical test theory approaches (i.e., a higher-order model comprising Openness to Life Experiences and Optimal Regulation factors), this measure has not been subjected to Rasch analysis. Accordingly, this paper evaluated the higher-order model via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) before assessing Openness to Life Experiences and Optimal Regulation components using Rasch analysis. CFA, using a general population sample ( N = 2009), supported the higher-order factor structure. Openness to Life Experiences and Optimal Regulation scales met Rasch model assumptions. Specifically, good item/person fit and item/person reliability, and evidence of unidimensionality. Moreover, most items displayed gender invariance. Overall, findings supported the higher-order conceptualisation of the ER89-R, and indicated that the Openness to Life Experiences and Optimal Regulation scales are relatively useful measures of ego resiliency components in a general population sample.
