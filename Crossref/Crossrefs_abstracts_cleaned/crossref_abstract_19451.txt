Information and communication technology has supported industrial digitalization and brought profound changes to many industries. Under the influence of new technologies and applications, the production mode, enterprise form, business mode and employment mode of manufacturing have accelerated reform, which has effectively promoted the production efficiency and green development of manufacturing. In the face of the complicated and severe economic situation and the wave of industrial digitalization in the world today, it is necessary to study the influence of the coordinated development of manufacturing and information communication service industries (M&ICS industries) on economic resilience. Based on the data of China’s 30 provinces during 2010–2020, this paper estimates the economic resilience and the degree of coordinated development of M&ICS industries. Next, based on the setting of two spatial weight matrices, it uses a spatial econometric model to systematically analyze the influence of the coordinated development of M&ICS industries on economic resilience across China’s provinces. The research results show that the economic resilience across China’s provinces had significant positive spatial correlation. Moreover, the coordination between M&ICS industries had a significant positive effect on economic resilience; however, such an effect was concentrated mostly locally, and the spillover effect on surrounding regions was negative and nonsignificant. This study is of vital strategic significance and practical value to promoting both the resilience of the regional economy and the digital transformation of manufacturing.
