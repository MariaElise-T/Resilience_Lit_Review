The advent of sustainability in housing and shelter is being identified as an important discuss for the coastal settlement. This is no further from the fact that this region is being confronted with series of issues bordering around flooding, prevailing wind action, loss of homes, properties and in extreme cases, ‘life(s)’. Moreover, this area has to deal with difficulty in proper disposal of waste among many other problems. The Ilaje community, standing as a perfect study area for this research, evidently reveals the importance of a sustainable, ecofriendly and resilient shelter as a necessity for coastline settlements. The outcome of this study proffers applicable solutions to tackling coastal settlement issues including flooding, loss of life and properties, proper faecal waste management while ensuring that uninterrupted electrical power supply is available for household electronic gadgets like radios, televisions, charging of phones and torchlights. Achieving these solutions and ensuring the longevity of the approach will necessitate the training of residents within the coastal settlement, skilled in technical works within the building industry on the construction method for future maintenance and if need be, in erecting newer shelters. Furthermore, there is need for collaboration between the private and public sector in providing the financial assistance needed to foster the acceptance and implementation of the solutions propounded in this research.
