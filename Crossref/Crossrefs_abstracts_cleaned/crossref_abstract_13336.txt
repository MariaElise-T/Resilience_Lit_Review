According to BPBD data for Central Java Province, the potential area for flood hazard in Central Java Province is 1,875,623 Ha. From the area of the hazard, it is known that the flood hazard class is in the high class in 31 districts/cities in Central Java. This research examines green infrastructure and community resilience to flooding in Central Java. The research approach was carried out using a mixed methods approach (quantitative and qualitative). Data was taken from 100 respondents for each urban district (400 respondents). There are 2 research variables and indicators, namely green infrastructure and community resilience to flooding. There is a unidirectional relationship between the green infrastructure index and community resilience. In areas with a relatively high level of infrastructure, the resilience index also scores high (Klaten Regency). Likewise, in areas with relatively low levels of infrastructure, the resilience index also scores low (Demak Regency).
