 In recent years high-profile terrorist attacks, industrial accidents and natural disasters have highlighted the importance of resilient infrastructure. This paper discusses the concepts and considerations associated with designing resilient physical infrastructure: the case for resilience is stated, providing a high-level overview of why it is important, the consequences of its absence and the significance of the concepts of risk and tolerance. To form the basis of design, resilience will be defined, exploring the significance of scale and understanding of the hazards. The challenges faced by the designer will be emphasised and, finally, guidance will be provided on how to incorporate better resilience into infrastructure design.
