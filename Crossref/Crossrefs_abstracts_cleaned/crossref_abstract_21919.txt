AbstractThere exists isolated work that focuses on context, resilience, and sustainability of information and communication technology for development (ICT4D). However, research on how the three concepts inform and influence one another to better meet the development goals and priorities is limited. More research is required to enhance our holistic understanding of ICT4D interventions in terms of the approaches applied to investigate context, resilience, and sustainability from socio‐technical perspectives. This research explores the link among the triple concepts to fill the above void, drawing from qualitative data collected from multiple but networked stakeholders at a local agriculture extension information service. Data is processed in a way to understand: the context of the local development practices and stakeholders, the gaps in the design of information systems applied to support local development practices, and how local communities remain resilient in their information exchange practices. Building on the existing knowledge of context, resilience, and sustainability in ICT4D the research shows how the context of the local development practices inform resilience and in turn how resilience enables the continued operation of the local development practices (context), and how context and resilience lead to sustainable ICT4D interventions. The research contributes to theory by showing how the social and technical resources distributed in the social system and the stakeholders' networks can be unlocked to conceptualize the links between the triple concepts. It informs practitioners on how they can develop a holistic understanding of the socio‐technical contexts of local developments and the socio‐technical factors to design resilient ICT4D that will lead to sustainable digital interventions.
