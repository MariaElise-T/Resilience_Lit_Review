AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic has placed considerable strain on healthcare workers showing high rates of stress and psychological health problems. Interventions are urgently needed to help healthcare workers perform under conditions of great risk and uncertainty. In particular, healthcare leadership is known to be critical to supporting healthcare workers to deal with an uncertain and distressing healthcare environment. This pilot study evaluated the impact of the R2 resilience program tailored for healthcare leaders working in a highly affected COVID‐19 area in Italy. Through two group cohorts, 21 healthcare leaders completed the intervention, with 17 participants providing pre‐ and post‐intervention assessment data. Sixty‐two staff members who benefitted from their coordinators' resilience‐focused leadership were also included in the study. Findings show that participation in R2 was associated with reduction in levels of perceived stress and burnout symptoms, and increases in rugged qualities, self‐efficacy and in social‐ecological resilience. Significant changes in rugged qualities, self‐efficacy and perceived stress were also detected in staff members. High rates of participants' program satisfaction have been detected. R2 is a promising intervention for healthcare professionals working in emergency settings designed to enhance the rugged qualities and resources required to deal with heightened exposure to stress.
