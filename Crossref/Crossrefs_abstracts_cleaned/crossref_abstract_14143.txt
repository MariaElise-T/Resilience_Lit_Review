There are approximately 38 million HIV-positive patients in the world. The effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy has significantly increased the life expectancy of infected patients. The objective of this study was to observe the relationship between resilience (assessed using the SPP-25 Scale), coping strategies (Mini-COPE Scale) as well as trauma effects (SF-CiOQ Scale) and quality of life (SWLS Scale) in people living with HIV. The study included 78 individuals (26 women and 52 men) aged 18â€“65 years. Significant relationships between resilience and coping strategies were demonstrated in people living with HIV. Resilience and active coping were conducive to positive trauma effects and satisfaction with life. Non-adaptive coping strategies favored negative trauma effects. The strategy of positive reframing acted as a mediator in the relationship between resilience vs. positive and negative trauma effects in people living with HIV. The scores indicate the need for practitioners to focus on interventions which elevate resilience and active coping to improve mental health in people living with HIV.
