Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare color, texture, and Shore A hardness of a resilient silicone denture liner with as‐polymerized, roughened, or pumiced surfaces after treatment with perborate‐, persulfate‐, or hypochlorite‐containing denture cleansers at 25° or 55°.Materials and Methods Fifty‐eight specimens that each exhibited an as‐polymerized, a roughened, and a pumiced area were exposed to 5 different commercially available perborate‐, persulfate‐, or hypochlorite‐containing denture cleansers at 25° or 55° continuously for 4 ½ months. The solutions were replaced twice a day. Control specimens were soaked in water with no cleanser. Before and after the 4 ½–month cleaning regimen, the color, hardness, and texture of resilient liner surfaces were evaluated using a color densitometer, a Shore A durometer (Shore Instrument & Mfg Co, Freeport, NY), and a surface profilometer, respectively. Differences among groups after the cleanser treatment were determined using a repeated measures analysis of variance (α= 0.05) and a Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test.Results Roughened specimen surfaces after 25° or 55° cleanser treatment exhibited significant color loss with some perborate‐containing cleansers compared with the control. Roughened specimens treated at 55° with perborate‐containing cleansers also exhibited significantly greater color loss than those treated with the persulfate‐containing cleanser. With roughened surfaces, significantly greater hardness was found with some perborate‐containing cleanser compared with a hypochlorite‐containing cleanser after treatment at 25°. No differences were observed in surface texture based upon cleanser treatment.Conclusion After silicone resilient denture liner treatment with certain perborate‐containing denture cleansers, a greater amount of components could leach from the liner leading to a loss of color if the liner surface is rough.
