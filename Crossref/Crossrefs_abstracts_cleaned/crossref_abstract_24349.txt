This paper refines the fuzzy logic method, while constructing a theoretical model of the relationship between economic resilience, social resilience and ecological resilience, and evaluates the coupling coordination between the economic-social-ecological resilience of 197 prefecture-level cities in China’s urban agglomerations in 2019. Findings include: (1) The mean ecological resilience of China’s urban agglomerations in 2019 was the highest, followed by economic and social resilience. (2) Promoting urban agglomerations had higher resilience scores in the three dimensions, especially in the economic dimension. Growing urban agglomerations had low resilience values on the whole, especially economic resilience. (3) The mean coupling coordination degree of economic-social-ecological resilience ranged from near-incoordination to narrow balance. (4) The coupling coordination degree between the two coincided with the positioning of existing urban agglomerations. (5) Economic resilience had the most significant impact on the coupling coordination. Finally, we give differentiated countermeasures to improve the resilience of urban agglomerations. This study aims to contribute to the promotion of urban resilience research, and helps to plan and design more rational urban economic-social-ecological systems, thereby enhancing the ability of cities to cope with any uncertainties and contingencies.
