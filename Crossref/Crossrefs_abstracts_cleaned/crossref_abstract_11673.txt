In smart factories, several mobile and autonomous robots are being utilized in warehouses to reduce overhead and operating costs. In this context, this paper presents a consensus-based fault-resilient intelligent mechanism called Consensual Fault-Resilient Behavior (CFRB). The proposed approach is based on three hierarchical plans: imposition, negotiation, and consensus. Fault resilience is achieved using the collective behavior of a multi-robot system that applies ternary decisions based on these plans. The difference between this paper and our previous work is on the consensual level. As it is suitable for the analysis and design of coordinated behavior between autonomous robots, the consensus plan is restructured and enhanced. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated in a virtual warehouse based on a real environment. In addition, it is compared with other current approaches, and the results are presented, demonstrating its efficiency.
