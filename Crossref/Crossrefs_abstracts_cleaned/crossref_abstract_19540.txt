The objective of this study was to develop a Resilience Programme through Group Dynamics on Academic Problems among Matthayom Suksa 1 Students at Chiang Mai University Demonstration School. For this, four junior high school students were selected as respondents. The effect of the resilience program was evaluated through a general questionnaire, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measures (COPM), and Resilience Inventory. Further, the resilience program was developed by using cognitive behavioral therapy combined with acceptance and commitment therapy, group dynamics, and resilience according to the concept of Grotberg. The total period of the program was 11 weeks, with 1 session per week lasting for 60 minutes. Results of the study revealed that all the selected respondents had higher academic performance and most of them (75%) had higher academic satisfaction and resilience score. After participating in this program, the samples had a higher average resilience score (114.5) as compared to those before participating in the program (107.5). The results of this study can be concluded that the newly developed resilience program can improve the resilience component in almost all the students. Hence, it can be practiced in junior high school students to manage their academic problems. This program can also be a prototype for developing future resilience programs.
