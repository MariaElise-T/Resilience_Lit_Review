The concept of network resilience has gained increasing attention in the last few decades owing to its great potential in strengthening and maintaining complex systems. From network-based approaches, researchers have explored resilience of real ecological systems comprising diverse types of interactions, such as mutualism, antagonist, and predation, or mixtures of them. In this paper, we propose a dimension-reduction method for analyzing the resilience of hybrid herbivore–plant–pollinator networks. We qualitatively evaluate the contribution of species toward maintaining resilience of networked systems, as well as the distinct roles played by different categories of species. Our findings demonstrate that the strong contributors to network resilience within each category are more vulnerable to extinction. Notably, among the three types of species in consideration, plants exhibit a higher likelihood of extinction, compared to pollinators and herbivores.
