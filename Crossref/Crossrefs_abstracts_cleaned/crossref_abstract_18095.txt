Purpose: This study aims to develop Café 247 as the resilience of J4 Hotels Legian in terms of physical buildings, products, operational and marketing processes and to determine the level of success of opening a café business so that this cafe makes a sustainable business.
Research methods: This study uses qualitative and quantitative analysis through SERVQUAl anal-ysis and IPA Analysis.
Findings: The results of the study show that in building the resilience of J4 Hotels Legian from the physical aspect of the building, products, operational and marketing processes, it requires good planning, organization, actualization and control so that it continues to provide satisfaction for café customers. The design of the 247 café project was accompanied by the J4 Hotels Legian facade replace-ment project, since the J4 Hotels facade really needs to be replaced consider-ing that the strength of the facade is already fragile, but here only describes the development process of café 247.
Implication: Based on the results of the servqual analysis, Cafe 247 is still in a safe stage because there is nothing excessive but still needs to be improved so that it can maintain the resilience of Cafe 247.
