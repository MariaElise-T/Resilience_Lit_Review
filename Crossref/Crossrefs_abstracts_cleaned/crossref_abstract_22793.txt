AbstractA bacterium's ability to thrive in the presence of multiple environmental stressors simultaneously determines its resilience. We showed that activation of the SigB‐controlled general stress response by mild environmental or energy stress provided significant cross‐protection to subsequent lethal oxidative, disulfide and nitrosative stress in Bacillus subtilis. SigB activation is mediated via the stressosome and RsbP, the main conduits of environmental and energy stress, respectively. Cells exposed to mild environmental stress while lacking the major stressosome components RsbT or RsbRA were highly sensitive to subsequent oxidative stress, whereas rsbRB, rsbRC, rsbRD, and ytvA null mutants showed a spectrum of sensitivity, confirming their redundant roles and suggesting they could modulate the signals generated by environmental or oxidative stress. By contrast, cells encountering stationary phase stress required RsbP but not RsbT to survive subsequent oxidative stress. Interestingly, optimum cross‐protection against nitrosative stress caused by sodium nitropruside required SigB but not the known regulators, RsbT and RsbP, suggesting an additional and as yet uncharacterized route of SigB activation independent of the known regulators. Together, these results provide mechanistic information on how B. subtilis promotes enhanced resistance against lethal oxidative stress during mild environmental and energy stress conditions.
