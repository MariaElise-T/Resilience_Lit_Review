The resilient design of urban parks in the context of public safety incidents is an important topic concerning both urban and public safety. This research, from a resilience perspective, explores the design of urban parks under the backdrop of public safety incidents. It analyzes the problems faced by urban parks in terms of social, natural, and engineering aspects, and proposes four phasesprevention, early warning, emergency response, and post-disaster recoveryemphasizing the elements of each phase. Moreover, a resilient design strategy is put forth: socialadaptive and versatile, embracing community sharing; ecologicalbalancing soft and hard elements, overcoming challenges with resilience; engineeringbuilding a foundation for disaster prevention, intelligent early warning. This strategy aims to enhance the resilience of parks, making them a crucial support for urban stability and public safety, while also providing valuable references for future urban planning and design.
