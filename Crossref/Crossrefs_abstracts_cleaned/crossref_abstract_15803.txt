This study examines the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Connor and Davidson's Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; 2003), an American instrument originating from a posttraumatic stress disorder research program. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Chinese data failed to
 verify the original 5-factor structure of CD-RISC obtained in the USA, while exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 3-factor structure of resilience (labeled respectively as Tenacity, Strength, and Optimism). The reliability coefficient of the Chinese version of CD-RISC was 0.91. The validity
 of CD-RISC was also satisfying in terms of the actual data matching the expected correlation between resilience measure and the variables of selfesteem, life satisfaction, and personality trait factors of NEO-FFI. It is concluded that the construct of resilience and its measurement from the
 West can be helpful and applicable in understanding Chinese adaptive behaviors, however, the understanding of the construct may also need some modification according to Chinese culture.
