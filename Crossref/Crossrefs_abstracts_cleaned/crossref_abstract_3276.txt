Ian Bauckham CBE chaired the Advisory Group on Building Character at the Department of Education. Baukham had previously advised the DfE, having led the work to update the Relationships, Sex and Health Education guidance for schools. This set out an increased focus on mental health and wellbeing.We sought to make the case for a more psychologically informed approach to character and resilience by sharing our evidence and best practice with policy makers advising government on the character and resilience agenda. Particularly we sort to encourage a wider definition of resilience from the one adopted by recent government policies, and encourage one that moved away from notions of individual responsibly.Society representatives (Helen O’Connor Clinical Psychologist and Nigel Atter) met with Ian Bauckham to make the case for positive psychology approaches within the school curriculum. They talked him through the Geelong Grammar School model of positive psychology education. We also highlighted MAC-UK’s work with marginalised groups, St. Swithun’s Happy Classrooms approach, which has character education at its heart and the Geelong model for positive education. Ian welcomed our briefing on Character and Resilience it also was promoted by the Children and Young People’s Mental Health Coalition’s (200 organisations) newsletter.
