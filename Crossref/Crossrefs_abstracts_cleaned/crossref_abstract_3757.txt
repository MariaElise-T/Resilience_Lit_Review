Abstract
 Analysis of the multistage cyclic loading test on resilient modulus value. Upon cyclic excitation of soil mass, two types of strain can be recognized, namely elastic and plastic one. Proper analysis of these two types of deformations can help engineers in designing more reliable structures. In this study, a multistage uniaxial cyclic loading in unconfined conditions was performed. Tests were performed in order to characterize strain response to repeated excitation. Soil sample under cyclic loading was recognized as exhibiting the symptoms of a plastic strain growth during the cyclic loading process with exponential manner, when compared to number of cycles. Soil in this study was reconstituted and compacted by using the Proctor method to simulate conditions similar to those affecting the road subbase. The soil was recognized as sandy clay. Results were analysed and a proposition of empirical formula for plastic strain calculation with the use of characteristic stress values was presented. The resilient modulus values were also calculated. The Mr value was within range from 45 to 105 MPa. The conclusions concerning the cyclically loaded soil in uniaxial conditions were presented.
