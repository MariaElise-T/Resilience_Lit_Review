Abstract
Recessions and natural disasters continually slow down the economy. The scale of the effects depends on the origin of the crisis, the response capacity, among other factors. The objective of this article was to study the impact of the recession due to covid-19 on business creation. Using indicators of related and unrelated variety, the industrial diversity of 16 states of Mexico was measured. The main source of information was administrative data. The results show that a region with higher related industrial diversity has greater resilience and more firms. In times of crisis, these results could be used to assess the loss of businesses, given the type and scale of industrial variety.
