Mindcast, a podcast devoted to children's mental health and produced at Bradley Hospital, had its debut this past week. Podcasting is a new venture for us at Bradley, and in full disclosure, I am co‚Äêhosting the series with my colleague Dr. Gregory Fritz. One of the first episodes is devoted to resilience, an especially timely topic in view of the children's mental health crisis.
