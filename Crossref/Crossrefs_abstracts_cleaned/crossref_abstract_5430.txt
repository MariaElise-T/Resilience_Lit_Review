The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the policy of higher education in Indonesia from conventional learning to online. This policy change encourages students to have psychological resilience and adaptability through digital resilience and academic skills. The research method is divided into two stages: qualitatively formulating a measurement construct using an open-ended questionnaire with a total of 137 respondents. Based on the qualitative data, a digital measuring instrument for resilience and academic skills was developed as a 5-choice Likert Scale. The second stage is carried out quantitatively, looking at the reliability and item-total correlation test to select items not aligned with the measuring function using the Statistical Program for Social Science. The trial was conducted on 137 respondents. Based on the digital scale of resilience trials, the results showed that 64.9% of respondents had high resilience, 33.8% had moderate stability, and 1.2% had low strength. While analyzing the items measuring digital resilience and academic skills research, it was found that Cronbach's Alpha reliability value was 0.917. So the measuring instrument for digital resilience and academic skills is reliable and appropriate to be used to explain the condition of students during Covid-19.
