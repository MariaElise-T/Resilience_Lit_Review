The present study was conducted to explore the relationship between resilience self-compassion, mindfulness and
emotional well-being of doctors working in critical and non-critical care units of patients. It was hypothesized that
there is likely to be positive relationship between resilience, self-compassion, mindfulness and emotional wellbeing
of doctors and resilience, self-compassion and mindfulness are likely to be positive predictors of emotional
well-being of doctors working in critical care and non critical care units of patients. Further it was also hypothesized
that there are likely to be gender differences in resilience, self-compassion, mindfulness and emotional well-being
of doctors. Data was collected from doctors (n = 100) with age range of 25 to 55 (M = 28.27, SD = 5.88) using
convenient sampling technique. The Brief Resilience Scale (Smith et al., 2008); Self-compassion Scale (Neff,
2003); Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan, 2003); and Scale of Positive and Negative
Experiences (SPANE, Diener et al., 2009) were used to collect data. The results of correlation analysis showed that
there was positive and significant correlation between resilience, self-compassion, mindfulness and emotional
well-being of both groups of doctors. Regression analysis revealed that self-compassion was only significant
predictor of emotional well-being. Moreover, significant gender differences were found on emotional well-being.
Nevertheless, resilience, self-compassion and mindfulness abilities are alike in male and female doctors.
