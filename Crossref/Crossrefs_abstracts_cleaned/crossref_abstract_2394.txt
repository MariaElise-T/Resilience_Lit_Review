Most of the worldâ€™s population resides in urban areas, and it is expected that this will continue to be the case in the future. These urban areas face enormous challenges such as climate change, economic instability and inequality. Housing is considered a basic unit comprising cities, and, as such, this study contextualized the concepts of urban resilience and sustainability against climate change such that housing models that respond to these concepts could be identified. As a result of an extensive literature review, three resilient housing models and four sustainable housing models are presented and discussed with a focus on the main characteristics necessary for meeting urban resilience and sustainability against climate change. When analyzing the housing models considered resilient, the need to establish housing on safe land stood out and concrete was a common building material among these housing models. In addition, the use of alternative sources of water and energy supply was prioritized. On the other hand, sustainable housing models were developed by local entities and certified by various initiatives. In addition, these models account for the climatic specifications of their location, energy and water efficiency, and quality of the indoor environment, and promote the use of local materials and resources. The use of durable materials was considered a requirement for both resilience and sustainability. The results of this study are a contribution to the process of strengthening housing against the challenge posed by climate change in a timely and adequate manner considering both urban resilience and sustainability aspects.
