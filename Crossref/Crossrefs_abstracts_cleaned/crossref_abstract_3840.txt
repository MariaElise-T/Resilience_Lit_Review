This descriptive-correlational study assessed the level of resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress among overseas Filipino seafarers and its relationship to demographic variables such as age, marital status, length of service, position category, and family structure.Â  Also, it sought to find out if resilience is associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Sixty-six overseas Filipino seafarers were obtained through convenience and snowball sampling in Iloilo. The data were gathered using the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) and were analyzed using percentage, mean, Fisher Exact test, and Pearson-r product.

There is no relationship between resilience, depression, anxiety, stress and demographic profiles. Moreover, resilience is negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.
