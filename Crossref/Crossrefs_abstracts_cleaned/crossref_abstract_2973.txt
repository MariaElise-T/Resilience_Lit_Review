This study was intended to examine the relationship between
personal growth, resilience, and burden of care among single
parents and role of resilience as mediator between personal
growth and burden of care. 100 single parents (M=37, F=63)
took part in this study. For data compilation, the personal
growth initiative scale-II, brief resilience scale, and burden
scale of family caregivers were used. The results demonstrated
that personal growth has a substantial positive correlation with
resilience and negative correlation with burden of care.
Furthermore, resilience significantly mediated the relationship
between personal growth and burden of care. Findings
evidenced that there are no significant gender differences. The
present study will be useful in creating awareness among single
parents to manage their stressors effectively.
