 This study applied the multi‐layered social resilience framework in the context of an urban malaria control programme by using a qualitative approach. It was found that exchange between and within administrative levels supported resilience‐building processes in terms of mosquito breeding site elimination. ‘Reactive’ and ‘proactive’ capacities were successfully built among programme staff. However, more potential could be tapped among local leaders and household members, by increasing their competence in eliminating breeding sites of malaria vectors. Improving the communication skills of the programme’s field workers might support such processes. Together with local leaders, they could act as multipliers of sensitisation messages.
