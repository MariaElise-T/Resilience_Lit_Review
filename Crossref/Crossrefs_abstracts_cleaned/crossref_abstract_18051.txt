AbstractPurposeThe purpose of this study was to examine relationships between change fatigue, resilience, and job satisfaction among novice and seasoned hospital staff nurses.BackgroundHealth care is typified by change. Frequent and vast changes in acute care hospitals can take a toll on nurses and cause change fatigue, which has been largely overlooked and under‐researched.Design and MethodA descriptive correlational design was employed with 521 hospital staff nurses in one midwestern state. Participants completed three online surveys: (a) Change Fatigue Scale, (b) Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale, and (c) McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale.FindingsIn a multiple regression model, job satisfaction had a statistically significant negative association with change fatigue (p < .001) and significant positive association with resilience (p < .001). A linear trend was found with hospital size (number of beds) and change fatigue (p = .001) and education level and resilience (p = .03).ConclusionsThe results are consistent with job satisfaction among hospital nursing staff being negatively influenced by change fatigue and positively influenced by resilience, although reverse causal connections are also possible. Change fatigue may be increased by larger hospital size (number of beds), and resilience may be increased by higher educational level of hospital staff nurses.Clinical RelevanceThe study advanced the nursing knowledge on change fatigue, resilience, and job satisfaction of staff nurses working in acute care hospitals. Engaging in strategies aimed at preventing change fatigue in nursing staff can enhance workplace environments, job satisfaction, and retention of nurses.
