 The potential for resilient behaviors and emotional intelligence involves an interplay between the individual and his or her broader environment. Studies that have examined resilience explore factors or characteristics that assist individuals to thrive from and in adversity. These protective factors are part of an individualâ€™s general makeup. Some of these factors are considered genetic, such as a personality that is outgoing and social; however, many protective behaviors can be learned. Coping in the face of adversity involves emotional intelligence and resilience, both of which can be developed through support and education. In this context, fostering resilience and emotional intelligence has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for mental health consumers.
