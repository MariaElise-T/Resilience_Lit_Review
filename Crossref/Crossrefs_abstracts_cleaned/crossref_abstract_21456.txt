AbstractThis study aimed to identify factors supporting young people's resilience during out‐of‐home care (OOHC) in Finland, despite challenges in their lives. In our qualitative study, we applied a social‐ecological framework to understand the experiences and perspectives of young people on what helped them and the help they would have needed during OOHC. The findings indicate (1) individual characteristics and interests (positive attitude, understanding own acts and their consequences and meaningful activities), (2) relationships (good relationships with close ones, ability to meet and keep contact with close ones, good relationships with professionals and relationships between parents and professionals) and (3) institutions (place of OOHC, youth‐centered practices, needs‐based services and support for the family) all supported the resilience of young people in OOHC. Further, to receive support from a particular medium, such as professionals (relationship level), a young person must already have some self‐understanding (individual level) of things. Essentially, youth resilience is supported through all these levels as a process.
