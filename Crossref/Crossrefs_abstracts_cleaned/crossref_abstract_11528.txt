Gajahmada Street is one of the main streets in the city of Semarang. The location is very strategic, which connects the Golden Triangle Region in Semarang City which is the center of the city. As a city center, transportation activities in the area are very high. Transportation activities produce carbon dioxide emissions. The accumulation of carbon dioxide emissions is dangerous for health and the environment. Semarang City Government provides green open space along the road section to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The purpose of this study was to determine the vegetation resilience to absorbing carbon dioxide at that location. The data collection method uses literature collection and field observations. The results showed the ability of green open space to absorb carbon dioxide emissions is 1.218,7 tons/ha/year. While the emissions produced are 6.832 tons/year, meaning that there is residual carbon dioxide that is not absorbed, that is 5.613,3 tons/year.
