AbstractThe crisis triggered by the emergence of COVID‐19, and the subsequent mandatory isolation was one of the most significant vulnerability‐inducing events in the past 100 years of humanity. The different experiences of individuals regarding this event led each person to construct their own vulnerability within the global vulnerability. Families have been major protagonists in this situation. The organized families with a healthy affective relational exchange have become resilient families, capable of facing such a critical situation with effective buffering factors. Within these families, resilience guardians have played a crucial role in the protective and supportive function towards their members. This article analyzes such factors, from global vulnerability to resilient families.
