Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease with pathophysiological factors not yet well known; it also presents a wide symptomatic range that makes us think about the need for multidisciplinary management. It is a chronic disease in which there is no definitive treatment, and is associated in a large majority of cases with psychological pathology. Connecting comorbidities and multimorbidities on a neurobiological, neuropsychological, and pathophysiological level could significantly contribute to their more successful prevention and treatment. In our study, resilience is analyzed as an adjunctive measure in the management of endometriosis. Methods: A multi-centre, cross-sectional study was performed to analyse resilience levels in a sample of Spanish women suffering from endometriosis. CDRIS-25, CDRIS-10, BDI, the STAI, and the SF-36 Health Questionnaire were used for assessments. A representative group of 202 women with endometriosis was recruited by consecutive sampling. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed for both resilience scales. Results: Mean CDRIS-25 and CDRIS-10 scores were 69.58 (SD 15.1) and 29.37 (SD 7.2), respectively. Women with adenomyosis and without signs of deep endometriosis showed the lowest scores. The best predictive model included womenâ€™s age, years of endometriosis evolution, number of pregnancies, and history of fertility problems as the best predictive factors. Conclusions: Women build resilience as the number of years of evolution of the disease increases. Symptoms such as dyspareunia and continued abdominal pain were more prevalent among less resilient women.
