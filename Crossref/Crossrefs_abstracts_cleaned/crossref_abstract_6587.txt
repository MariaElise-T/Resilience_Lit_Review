The primary purpose of this study is to explore the impact of 2017 Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rican college students directly affected by the storm, including how institutions of higher education fostered resilience for displaced and non-displaced students transitioning to navigating college after the storm. Findings indicate that participants were greatly affected by Hurricane Maria, and community ties, along with logistical challenges, influenced their college experiences after the storm. Participants shared suggestions for campus educators to better serve students in transition after the hurricanes, indicating that providing swift, clear responses to crises, including proactive outreach, are key institutional actions in addition to creating community and demonstrating care for individual student circumstances.
