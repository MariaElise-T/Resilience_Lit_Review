 Housing constitutes a basic need for all living beings. Unfortunately, natural hazards, including floods, pose a severe threat to housing infrastructure systems. In turn, this paper develops a framework to quantify the resilience of housing infrastructure systems against flood hazards. The parameters for this resilience are based on the literature and knowledge from experts. This paper gauges the significance of each resilience parameter by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy AHP. The evaluated values are then compared to observe the effectiveness of fuzzy AHP over AHP. The evaluated importance of each parameter will help stakeholders focus on the most important parameters and, in turn, boost the flood resilience of infrastructure. This paper then implements the developed framework in a study area to quantify local flood resilience. This resilience value will help stakeholders in the considered area to understand the resilience of local housing infrastructure.
