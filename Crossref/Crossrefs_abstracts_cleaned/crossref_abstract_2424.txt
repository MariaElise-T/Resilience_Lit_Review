The main purpose of this paper is to improve public awareness of the influence campaigns carried out in the Romanian public space, via traditional and internet media that are at odds with national interests. In the context of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign that frequently spreads disinformation among civil society members and, more concerning, generates hostility between the Romanian citizens and their officials, the most common Russian narratives used in Romania are analyzed, and their misleading aspects are revealed. Thepaper also covers the resilience approach at national level, as well as at the EU and NATO levels, in order to better understand the instruments and procedures available for lowering risks and managing threats affecting the Romanian society. In light of the current situation in Ukraine, the study presents a series of conclusions regarding how the dissemination of misleading narratives influenced the information environment in Romania
