 Using a model of resilience, this study compared the direct and indirect associations between resilience resources (sense of mastery, openness to experience, emotion regulation, and social support) and life satisfaction among caregiving subgroups (spouses, adult-children, and parents). Participants were included from the survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS II). Estimates of direct and indirect relationships between the resources and life satisfaction were calculated for each subgroup, and differences in the relationships between subgroups were tested. The direct positive relationships between sense of mastery and life satisfaction were significant and stronger for spouses and parents than for adult-children. In contrast, an indirect relationship through social support between the two variables was stronger for adult-children than for spouses. Openness to experience had a direct positive link to life satisfaction among spouses, and emotion regulation was directly related to life satisfaction among parents. We suggested targeted interventions for caregiving subgroups.
