The extent to which parent, school, and peer support differentially affected multiple domains of resilience was examined among 2,600 sixth, eighth, and tenth graders from an urban public school system who took part in a comprehensive survey of high–risk and adaptive behaviors. Structural equation modeling was used to specify the relation among seven domains of resilience and parent, school, and peer support among children who had been victimized by community violence, those who had witnessed such violence, and a no–exposure control group. Results upheld the validity of a multidimensional conceptualization of childhood resilience, and indicated that although both parent and school support factors were significantly positively associated with resilience in children who had been exposed to community violence, peer support was negatively associated with resilience in the domains of substance abuse and school misconduct/ delinquency. These results were most robust among victimized children, followed by children who had witnessed violence. Implications for social policy and community violence research are discussed.
