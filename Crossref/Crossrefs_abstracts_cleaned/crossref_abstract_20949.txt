AbstractThe warming climate can considerably affect socioeconomic activities and environmental health conditions in Canada. Climate models play a key role in evaluating the impact of climate change and developing adaption and mitigation strategies corresponding to Canadian regions. This study compares the behavior of climate models participating in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with their CMIP5 predecessors in representing a set of climate indices relevant to Canada’s agricultural productivity, infrastructure resilience, and environmental health. Our results show that although CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi‐model ensemble mean values for the considered indices are almost similar, the behavior of individual CMIP5 and CMIP6 models or even the model pairs of the same modeling center can be different across Canada. Moreover, the CMIP6 models do not necessarily outperform CMIP5 in comparison to NOAA and NCEP reanalysis datasets in simulating the annual mean and coefficient of variation values for the indices during the historical period. The comparisons between models’ simulations also reveal that the envelope of estimated values based on individual CMIP6 models does not cover or overlap with their CMIP5 counterparts or even with other CMIP6 models. Therefore, the CMIP6 models with higher number of simulations do not necessarily provide a larger range of projections over Canadian regions. The divergence between CMIP5 and CMIP6 models’ behavior is more obvious under the 8.5 W/m2 forcing in the long‐term horizon. Overall, the estimated sign, magnitude, and spatial pattern of changes in the climate indices depend on the considered climate model and forcing scenario.
