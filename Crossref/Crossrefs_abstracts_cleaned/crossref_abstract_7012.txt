​Social unrest, isolation, and uncertainty marked 2020. Governor’s House Library along with other educators and interpreters of history bore witness to our nation’s reckoning with issues of racial inequalities in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Through a series of community conversations last summer, "Resilience: Black Heritage in St. Augustine" emerged as collaboration across cultural heritage and educational institutions. These discussions yielded a group effort to better center the many contributions the Black community made and continues to make in St. Augustine.
The Resilience project is a year-long effort manifesting throughout 2021 in a variety of programming formats, including lectures, exhibits, digital humanities projects, and special tours. These initiatives, taken on by individual libraries, archives, and museums, work together to tell the important story of Black St. Augustinians and their many contributions to our city and culture throughout our 455- year history.
This article will explore Governor’s House Library’s participation in this initiative, the project’s successes and challenges, and the ways in which we can foster meaningful community and support while we are physically apart.
Governor's House Library is managed jointly by UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc., and the UF George A. Smathers Libraries.
