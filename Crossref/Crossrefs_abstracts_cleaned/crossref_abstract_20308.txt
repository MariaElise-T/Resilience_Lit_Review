SummaryThis paper investigates the robust resilient control problem for a class of parametric strict feedback nonlinear systems with prescribed output and virtual tracking errors performance. The resilience is governed by a continuously nonlinear control gains function, which endows the virtual and actual controllers with self‐adjusting abilities with respect to transformed error surfaces. The proposed control scheme is adaptation, estimation, and approximation‐free in the presence of unknown parameters and nonlinearities, and only a number of control gains, which is equal to the relative degree of the considered plants, need to be selected in applications. It is proved by rigorous analysis that the output tracking errors are confined in predefined prescribed performance functions under some nonrestrictive initial conditions, and the bounds of states are obtained characterized as control gains and systemic function‐associated constants. Finally, comparative illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
