The effects of deviator stress, molding moisture content, stabilizer type and content, curing period, and soil type on the resilient modulus (Mr) of lime- and cement-stabilized cohesive soils were investigated by using Hydrite R (kaolinite) and sodium bentonite (montmorillonite) blends. It was found that Mrincreases with decreasing deviator stress, increasing lime and cement content, and extended curing period. Moisture variations around optimum had little effect on Mrwith higher lime contents. Multiple regression analyses and Student's t-tests indicated that all the factors investigated were significant and could be related to Mrby predictive regression equations. For a given stabilizer type and content, the low-plasticity clay (CL) soil produced the best results. The cement-stabilized CL soil normal cured for 28 days produced the highest Mrvalue. However, cement stabilization was not found to be very effective for the high-plasticity clay (CH) soil. Mineralogical composition has a marked effect on the Mrof lime and cement-stabilized cohesive soils. Kaolinitic CL soils work better than montmorillonitic CH soils with both lime and cement.
