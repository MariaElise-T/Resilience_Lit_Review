This study aims to examine the predictive power of resilience for stress susceptibility. The study group consists of 289 individuals between 21 and 53. The Stress Susceptibility Scale and the Adult Resilience Measure were used to collect data in the present research. Data were analyzed using correlation and regression analysis. The results of the correlation analysis showed a significant negative relationship between stress susceptibility and the dimensions of psychological resilience, such as relational sources, individual sources, and familial sources. The regression analysis results showed that the dimensions of psychological resilience, such as relational sources and cultural and contextual sources, significantly predicted stress susceptibility. Additionally, the study found that stress susceptibility scores did not show statistically significant differences according to gender and marital status.
