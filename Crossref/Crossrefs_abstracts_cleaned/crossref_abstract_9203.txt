There have been researches going on that have focused on strength based approach like resilience to motivate the students for improving their academic performances. Failing to perform well can create school difficulties like academic work related issues, adjustment to school environment, behaviour regulation, etc which may later stimulate mental health problems. Thus it is very important to early identify these issues to promote the best possible outcome for students. Though studies are very limited in counselling and education but it appears to suggest that Motivational Interviewing (MI) may be effective in addressing studentâ€™s academic motivation to perform well. Thus the objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of Motivational Interviewing on improving resilience among students with below average academic performance. A student with below average academic performance was selected for the study from Dibrugarh Bengali High School, Dibrugarh, Assam. Pre and post assessment of the resilience level was assessed by using the Adolescent Resilience Scale. In between pre and post assessment, MI was applied to the student for 10 sessions alternatively. Post assessment and follow-ups were done to check any improvement on resilience. The result of the study concluded that at present Motivational Interviewing has shown to be effective on improving resilience among students with below average academic performance.
