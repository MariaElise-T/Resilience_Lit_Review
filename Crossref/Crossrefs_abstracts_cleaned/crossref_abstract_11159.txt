Background
Engaging in self-care behaviors improves outcomes in patients with heart failure. Identifying psychological factors that affect self-care behaviors and the role of resilience may inform interventions that improve outcomes.


Objectives
The study objective was to determine the relationships among depression, anxiety, resilience, and self-care, including whether resilience mediates or moderates the effects of depression and anxiety on self-care.


Methods
Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to estimate the relationships of depression, anxiety, and resilience with self-care behaviors. Mediating and moderating effects of resilience on the relationships of depression and anxiety with self-care were evaluated using multiple linear regression.


Results
Depression and anxiety were associated with lower self-care. Higher resilience was associated with lower depression and anxiety, but resilience did not mediate or moderate the relationship of depression and anxiety with self-care.


Conclusions
Interventions that foster resilience may improve outcomes by reducing anxiety and depression in patients with heart failure.
