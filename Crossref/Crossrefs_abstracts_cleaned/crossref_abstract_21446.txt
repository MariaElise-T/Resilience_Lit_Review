Migration has appeared as a constitutive aspect of global reality today. While the COVID-19 pandemic has spared no single community, the migrant population has been the hardest hit. The woes of this population have been exacerbated by imposed immobility, restrictions, xenophobic treatment, residential status, poor living conditions, and limited access to health and protection. Millions of jobs have vanished. Millions of migrants got stranded either in their destination or origin countries and are unsure if they can return to their work. Against this backdrop, they try to stand up by seeking resilience. This study looks into how migrants in varying situations—those who returned home, those trapped in transit, and those who remained in the host nations—gain stability in the devastating pandemic. While a wealth of literature has been generated, the issue of migrants’ resilience has received little attention. This article employs content analysis to examine the gravity of the impact of the pandemic on the migrants and the process of developing their resilience. This article contributes to the broader debate about the dynamics of migration, COVID-19, and resilience. This research has implications for the policymakers of both the receiving and sending countries.
