Climate change mitigation, adaptation to intensifying hurricanes, and decarbonization challenges in developing countries emphasize the urgent need for resilient high-voltage grids to facilitate the expansion of renewables. This research explores the technical feasibility of extending the U.S.–Caribbean Super Grid to include the Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana, and the northeastern part of Brazil in South America. This proposed extension aims to capitalize on the recent introduction of a new generation of wind turbines certified for operation under strong hurricane forces. The research utilizes modeling and simulation techniques to evaluate the performance of the proposed extension. A method for modeling and estimating spatiotemporal wind power profiles is applied, and the results demonstrate a reduction in maximum wind power variability within the U.S.–Caribbean Super Grid. Depending on the hurricane trajectory, the variability is reduced from 56.6% to less than 43.2%. This reduction takes effect by distributing peak surplus wind power alongside the proposed U.S.–Caribbean–South America Super Grid (UCASG). The research concludes by acknowledging the merits and limitations of the study and discussing potential directions for future research in this field.
