This research aims to investigate the impact of the family on the social support for children with mental health disorders in a vulnerable environment such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ability of parents to provide consistent care giving using their social support. The main question of this research paper is: what is the impact of the family in the situation of COVID-19 on the diversity of the processes actors provided in creating social adaptability for children with mental health? The previous question was treated via the following hypotheses: H1: the more the whole family is committed to the social support of the child with a mental health disorder, the less independent the achievement of resilience on an individual basis; H2: the more the child with a mental illness belongs to the family, the greater the family’s involvement in social support, even for low-income families. This quantitative field study was conducted in southern Morocco by contacting a sample of respondents (86 respondents) from health institutions, civil society, and the children’s parents and relatives. The study reflected two main findings: that the majority of children were with their families during the pandemic; and the lack of independence of parents and children in the adjustment process.
