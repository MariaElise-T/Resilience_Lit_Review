AbstractSystems engineering deals with artificial systems conceived by human beings. These systems are combinations of elements aiming at one or more definite goals. Sociotechnical systems consist in technical parts, concerning systems engineering issues, and in human and organizational parts, concerning medical and social sciences issues. Resilience reports to the capacity of sociotechnical systems to adjust faced with disturbing events, to adapt and learn the adequate rules of adaptation, when the disturbances are out of the specified perimeter of the system's adaptation mechanisms. After having characterized resilience, the article highlights its relevance to the field of the sociotechnical systems. Then, sociotechnical systems' resilience is articulated with systems engineering and architecture in order to evolve systems engineering processes, engineering models, system architecture and enabling systems. Lastly, the article underlines the fact that systems engineering is necessary and owes being supplemented of good practices of management which contribute to the of sociotechnical systems resilience.
