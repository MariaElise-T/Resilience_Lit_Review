Climate change has been perceived with high emphasis from the beginning of this century. Since it directly impacts the ecosystem and agriculture especially over the farmers of dryland regions. The research study has been conducted to assess the farmersâ€™ attitude towards climate-resilient technologies of the National Initiatives on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project by farmers of Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. The sample consists of 60 farmers as beneficiaries from NICRA villages and 60 farmers as nonbeneficiaries from non-NICRA villages were selected randomly. The ex-post facto research design was used in the study. The results of the study showed that more than half of the beneficiaries (51.67 %) and 48.33 per cent of non-beneficiaries had a medium level of favorableness towards climate-resilient technologies of the NICRA project. From the above findings, this is concluded that both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the NICRA project have a positive favourable attitude towards climate-resilient technologies which is considered as a precursor for adoption of those technologies by the farming community. Hence the results of this research study may help extension organizations for good training and implementation of climate-resilient technologies of National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA).
