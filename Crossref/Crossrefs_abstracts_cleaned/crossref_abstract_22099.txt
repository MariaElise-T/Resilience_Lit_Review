AbstractResilience has become a topic of renewed interest due to the frequent difficulties encountered by organisations and individuals in the present turbulent world. It is widely recognised that HRM practices play a crucial role in stimulating employee resilience. However, only few studies have explored the role of socially responsible human resource management (SRHRM) in enhancing employee resilience. Accordingly, our study aims to address this research gap by utilising self‚Äêdetermination theory to develop a theoretical model clarifying the effect of SRHRM on employee resilience, focusing on the mediating role of basic psychological needs. Furthermore, we identify collectivism as a critical moderating factor in the relation between SRHRM and employee resilience. For this purpose, data were collected from 355 employees in central China in three waves. Results revealed that SRHRM can enhance employee resilience by fulfilling basic psychological needs. Moreover, the results indicated that collectivism strengthens the indirect relation between SRHRM and employee resilience through the fulfilment of basic psychological needs.
