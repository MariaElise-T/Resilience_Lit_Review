Abstract
As the number of disaster events in all parts of the world increases, studies on the topic of community resilience and spatial planning are also increasing because of its role is believed can minimize the risk of exposure to disasters. This study aims to investigate the various kinds of published work related to this research topic worldwide to give meaningful insights on the trend of preceding publications. This study performed a bibliometric analysis of the community resilience and spatial planning related papers published between 2000 and 2021. Based on the keywords selected, the study obtained 144 scholarly documents associated to research topic from the Scopus online database as of August 2021. Authors then employed some tools for further analysis including Microsoft Excel to conduct the frequency analysis, Harzingâ€™s Publish or Perish for citation metric and analysis, and VOSviewer for data visualization purpose. The findings of basic bibliometric statistics are presented in this paper, with a focus on the rate of publication growth, citation analysis, and research productivity. Since 2000, the growth rate of literature in community resilience and spatial planning has increased gradually year by year. Most of the articles were published in journals and conferences, the majority of which were in English. Many of the research was in the field of social sciences and environmental sciences. The urban planning and community resilience were the most frequently used keywords, representing the main areas of research covered by the research topic. Most of the community resilience and spatial planning related research was conducted in United States. This study proposes that research on community resilience and spatial planning should be conducted in other less developed countries, as the disaster's impact was affected mostly in these regions.
