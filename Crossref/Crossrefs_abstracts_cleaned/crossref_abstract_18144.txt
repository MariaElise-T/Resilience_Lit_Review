To explore the relationships between complex trauma, family cohesion, family environment, resiliency, and depression, the authors employed hierarchical multiple regression and mediation analysis were employed with a sample of 485 young adults. The sample consisted of three groups of participants based on the amount of trauma experienced, those who reported 1â€“3 trauma experiences, those who reported 3 or more trauma experiences, and those who did not report trauma. Analyses indicated that despite complex trauma experiences, families were still able to cultivate strong family environment and family cohesion, which enhanced resilience in individuals and in turn reduced depression symptoms. Future research, as well as important implications for family counseling with the aim of enhancing family resilience and decreasing depression symptoms, especially as a trauma response, are discussed.
