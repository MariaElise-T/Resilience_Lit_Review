We continue to study the implications of IR Cohen's work on immune cognition for vaccine strategies when simple elicitation of sterilizing immunity fails, using a mathematical model derived from the large deviations programme of applied probability. Our work makes explicit the linkage between an individual's ‘immunocultural condensation’ and embedding social or historical structures and processes, in particular power relations between groups. We use methods adapted from the theory of ecosystem resilience to explore the consequences of the sudden ‘perturbation’ caused by infection, in the context of such embedding. The methodology opens pathways in the design of vaccine strategy which are closed by simplistic genetic or cross-sectional ‘inequality’ analyses that — in effect — either reify ‘race’ or deny the persisting burdens of racism.
