Unemployment is a big problem faced by the Indonesian people from year to year besides poverty. Therefore it is necessary to predict the level of open unemployment in Indonesia so that later the government and private parties have the right references and references to work together to overcome this problem. The prediction method used is Resilient Backpropagation which is one method of Artificial Neural Networks which is often used for data prediction. The research data used is open unemployment data according to the highest education completed in 2005-2018 based on the semester obtained from the website of the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics. Based on this data a network architecture model will be formed and determined, including 12-6-2, 12-12-2, 12-18-2, 12-24-2, 12-12-12-2, 12-12-18 -2, 12-18-18-2 and 12-18-24-2. From these 8 models after training and testing, the results show that the best architectural model is 12-18-2 (12 is the input layer, 18 is the number of hidden neurons and 2 is the output layer). The accuracy of the architectural model for semester 1 and semester 2 is 75% with an MSE value of 0.0022135087 and 0.0044974696
