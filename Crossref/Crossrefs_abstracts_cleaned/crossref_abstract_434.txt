Despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers continue to navigate the new normal in education which demonstrate their resilience. This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables. Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are highly optimistic amidst the pandemic. This paper also validates earlier claims that lower levels of job stress contribute to lower incidents of emotional exhaustion.
