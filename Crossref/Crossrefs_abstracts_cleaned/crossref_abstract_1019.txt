Burnout and mental health issues among residents are associated with adverse health consequences and suboptimal job performance, e.g. increased medical error. Given role models as key to cultivating resilience, we created faculty resilience narrative videos within resilience skill training programs, hypothesizing such videos would provide new perspectives/insights on resiliency and humanize attendings in a useful way. Child and adult neurology residents at two institutions positively rated the impact of these faculty videos. Such videos are an innovative and practical way to: 1) provide exemplar role models for learning about coping with physician challenges and gaining insights on resilience; 2) access stories of triumph over challenge for inspiration; and 3) work to achieve local culture change by reducing stigma and increase empathy/connection during training. Successful implementation of this video innovation provides good rationale for further evaluation of impact on local culture, faculty experience, and resident attitudes and behavior.
