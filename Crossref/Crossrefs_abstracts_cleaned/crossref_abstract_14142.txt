 This article describes the preliminary investigation of the initial feasibility of the ‘ Fostering Youth Resilience Project’, a universal school-based program delivered by school social workers to 54 high school students in Kuwait. Results reported significant positive change and high satisfaction with the program. The study provided initial evidence support to the applicability of the program for youth in a non-Western culture. Future research needs to evaluate the effect of the program in larger groups, using controlled trials and longer term follow ups. Discussion of limitations and practical implications for the social work profession are presented.
