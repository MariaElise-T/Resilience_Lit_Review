 The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a global crisis with far-reaching impacts on various aspects of society, including labor migration and family dynamics. Among the vulnerable populations affected were transnational mothers who, having migrated in pursuit of economic opportunities, found themselves unexpectedly laid-off and compelled to return to their home countries. This phenomenological research endeavored to unravel the lived experiences of these laid-off transnational mothers as they navigate the complex journey of emergency return and reintegration during the pandemic. Drawing on a qualitative phenomenological approach, this study engaged in-depth interviews to explore the dimensions of these mothers’ experiences. The research journey illuminated the challenges, coping mechanisms, and transformations that emerged as these mothers embarked on a journey of returning to rebuild their lives and identities. Findings revealed that the sudden job loss and subsequent return disrupted established life trajectories, leading to a profound sense of dislocation and ambiguity. The mothers’ narratives captured the struggles of renegotiating roles within families and communities, grappling with economic instability, and confronting the intersections of gender, migration, and resilience. By bringing these individual stories to the forefront, the research underscored the urgent need for tailored support mechanisms, inclusive policy responses, and heightened awareness of the unique challenges faced by transnational mothers in crisis situations.
