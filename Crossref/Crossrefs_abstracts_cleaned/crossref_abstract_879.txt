Purpose
 – The purpose of this paper is to report a comprehensive review of supply chain resilience and identify several research issues. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – The articles which have been published in international journals in the period 1980-2012 were collected by using databases like ISI Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect and EBSCO. The articles were scrutinized based on relevance to context and value addition. The articles contributing significantly in the domain of supply chain resilience were selected for final review and various issues were identified. 


Findings
 – The paper argues that though several conceptual to few empirical works been done on supply chain resilience in recent years, there is large scope for research to address the issues in risk management, supply chain design, sourcing strategies, green practices, sustainable competitive advantage, supply chain security, supply chain performance and supply chain resilience. 


Research limitations/implications
 – The insights deduced in the paper are primarily based on 45 articles selected for critical review and analysis in the domain of supply chain resilience and hence should be interpreted only as key concerns in the area. 


Originality/value
 – The paper reports an evaluation of 45 key articles reported in the domain of supply chain resilience and indicates the research opportunities in the area.
