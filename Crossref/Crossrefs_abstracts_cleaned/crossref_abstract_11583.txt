This paper discusses the process of adaptation and farmer resilience to the effects of COVID-19. It illustrates the change in behaviour of farm managers faced with the structural crisis of value chains in the oil palm sector. The study in Tabou combined both quantitative and qualitative research. These two (2) approaches were implemented using techniques (documentary research, interview, observation) and data collection tools (interview guide, questionnaires, observation grid). The study shows that the health crisis linked to COVID-19 has led to disorganisation within the oil palm cooperative societies. These companies are losing members due to the slowdown in palm oil processing companies, the inability of the supervisory structures (PALMCI [1] and cooperatives) to absorb almost all village production, and the instability (downward) of the purchase price per kilogram of palm oil. Faced with the crisis, poor sales, rotting production and food insecurity, farmers created networks for the direct purchase of production and the artisanal processing of palm oil. Thus, in the face of the agrarian crisis, peasant societies are finding endogenous resources to meet their daily needs.
