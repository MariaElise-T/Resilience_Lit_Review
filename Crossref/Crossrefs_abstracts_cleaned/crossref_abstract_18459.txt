This study aims to analyze the effect of high school students' self-directed learning attitude on class satisfaction through resilience. To achieve this, a structural equation model was established to examine the relationship between the three variables, and data from 2,793 general high school students within the 9th year of SELS2010 were analyzed. The results showed the fit of the structural equation model was very good (CFI=.983, TLI=.976, RMSEA=.059, SRMR=.033). Moreover, self-directed learning attitude had a statistically significant positive effect on resilience and class satisfaction, and resilience also had a statistically significant positive effect on class satisfaction. Additionally, the mediating effect of resilience was found to be statistically significant. These findings suggest that educational efforts to enhance not only self-directed learning attitude but also resilience is needed to improve high school students' class satisfaction.
