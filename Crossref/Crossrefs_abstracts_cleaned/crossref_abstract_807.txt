This study adapted the Physical Disability Resilience Scale (PDRS) to Chinese conditions and evaluated the psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version in individuals with physical disability. A total of 438 individuals with physical disability were included in this study. The PDRS was translated to Chinese using a backward translation method. Construct validity, internal consistency reliability, and convergent validity were examined. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the original five-factor structure of the PDRS. After removing the Spirituality factor and an underperformed item (Item 22), exploratory factor analysis yielded four trait factors (i.e., Emotional and Cognitive Strategies, Physical Activity and Diet, Peer Support, and Support from Family and Friends) and a method-effect factor. A correlated traitâ€“correlated method model that included the four trait factors and a method-effect factor reported better model fit than the four-factor model, which did not consider method effects. The four subscales of the revised PDRS showed adequate internal consistency. The convergent validity of the revised PDRS was established by the moderate-to-strong associations between its four subscales and theoretically related constructs. We conclude that the revised PDRS is a reliable and valid measure in assessing resilience among Chinese people with physical disability.
