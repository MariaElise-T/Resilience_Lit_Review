Introduction Impostor Phenomenon (IP) is the inability to internalize success and a tendency to attribute success to external causes. Social and institutional support are strategies to avoid the problem, but only partially successful. Resilience has been considered protective against mental health disorders in medical students. This study aims to investigate the association between IP and resilience in undergraduate medical students. Methods Using Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and a socio-demographic questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional, quantitative study with undergraduate medical students. Results The study included 425 pre-clerkship medical students of average age of 23.03 years. The prevalence of IP was 47.76% (CIPS ≥ 62 score, as recommended in prior literature.) and there were no differences among age, gender, current semester, religion. The majority student's CD-RISC score was 68.57 ± 14.66 and there was no statistical difference in resilience scale among age, gender, religion and training semester. “Other religions” group was associated with a higher resilience score when compared to “Catholic” or “Non-religious” students. We found an inverse correlation between the level of resilience by CD-RISC and the level of symptoms related to IP by CIPS (ρ = −0.409; p-value < .001). Conclusions Findings from this study suggest that higher levels of resilience are likely protective against IP among undergraduate medical students. Furthermore, the non-inclusion of medical internship students and the cross-sectional design of this study are restraining aspects noticed within the project, suggesting the need for further studies to adjust those limitations.
