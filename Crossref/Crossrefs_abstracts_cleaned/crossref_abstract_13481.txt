 This article examines how a 6-week mental health resilience course for people with long-term conditions (LTCs; diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis) increased perceived resilience of older participants. This article examines how peer support assisted participants to develop resilience, considers gender issues, examines the importance of course activities, and explores how resilience enhances quality of life. A mixed methods approach was used. A before-and-after questionnaire was administered 3 times, including 3-month follow-up. Interviews were held with 24 program participants, aged 45 to 80 years. Diaries were kept by participants over 3 months. Survey findings showed significant gains in perceived resilience, at the end of the course, with no significant drop-off after 3 months. Interview and diary narratives highlighted positive experiences around well-being, condition management, and social engagement. Peer support was key to effective processes. Challenges concern ongoing support in communities, and considering age and gender variables when researching what improved resilience means to older people with LTCs.
