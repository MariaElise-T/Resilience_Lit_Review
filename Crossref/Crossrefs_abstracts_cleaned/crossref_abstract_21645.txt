This research paper presents a preliminary study aimed at closing the resilience gap in Indonesia through the establishment of a national fragility curve catalog for multi-hazard assessment. Indonesia is located in a high-risk hazard area, yet it currently lacks a comprehensive fragility curve catalog, which hinders effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies. By developing this database, the study aims to improve the understanding of structural vulnerability and enhance resilience planning across various hazards, such as earthquake, tsunami, wind, and flood. The research methodology involves collecting and analyzing data on the performance of different building types, exposed to multiple hazards. This includes considering various factors such as construction materials, design standards, and geographical characteristics. Statistical techniques and analytical modeling will be utilized to derive fragility curves that depict the probability of exceeding different damage levels or performance states given a specific hazard intensity. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the vulnerability of infrastructure and communities in Indonesia, enabling more informed decision-making for disaster risk reduction and resilience planning. The fragility curve database will facilitate quantitative risk assessments, support the development of appropriate building codes and standards, and inform the prioritization of mitigation measures. Ultimately, the establishment of a national fragility curve database will contribute to enhancing Indonesia's resilience to multi-hazard events and improving disaster preparedness at various scales.
