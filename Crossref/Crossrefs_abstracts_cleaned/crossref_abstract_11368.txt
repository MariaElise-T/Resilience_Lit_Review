Purpose
Witmer's belief in the benefits of degendering resiliency is based on three assumptions. First, that gender is socially constructed. Second, that what is historically, socially and culturally constructed as masculine is seen as superior to what is seen as feminine, and third, that the gender system in organisations reproduces masculine power structures that marginalize the feminine qualities of the willow.


Design/methodology/approach
Witmer proposes the degendered organizational resilience (DOR) model to challenge current thinking and encourage more diverse practices. She analyses resilience factors using the three aspects of the DOR, which are power structure, gendering practices and language.


Findings
The author concludes by saying that a dual focus on resilience and inclusivity will “benefit men, women and the organisation, and it creates the space for innovation, learning and collective transformation.” The result will be a degendered construct that arms organisations with the “agile, collaborative aspects of the willow and the rational, logical aspects of the oak.”
