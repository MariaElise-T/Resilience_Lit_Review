 Regarding the approach of reducing risks of settlements, a system is considered to be resilient if it can address temporary and permanent risks and adapt itself to rapidly changing conditions without losing its functionality. To this end, a dynamic management approach on a local scale is needed for realizing resilience. Due to the importance of local management in improving resilience in cities, this study aims to assess the resilience capacity of the local risk management in terms of exposure to various crises in Tabriz, Iran. The findings in this study show that integrity and coordination in decision- or policy-making, enhancement of organizational and local capacities, and confrontation or rehabilitation approaches in critical conditions and after that are not desirable in Tabriz. Also, the centralized and top-down approaches lead to no proper local planning and management that can facilitate the resilience measures. In light of no spatial equilibrium in Tabriz and the inefficiency of conventional planning and management systems, technocrat-oriented and top-down, changing the management practices and emphasizing the local and bottom-up approach are necessary for the thorough understanding of facilities and limitations and implementation of realistic planning.
