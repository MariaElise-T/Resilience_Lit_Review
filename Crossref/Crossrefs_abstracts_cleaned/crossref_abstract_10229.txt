 Abstract. The Brief Resilience Scale ( BRS) is a reliable and valid assessment of the self-perceived ability to bounce back or recover quickly from stress. The current study translated and validated the French version of the BRS (BRS-F) in a sample of N = 220 midwives. In a confirmatory factor analysis, the unifactorial model fitted acceptably to the data. High levels of Tucker’s φ implied that the component loadings of the BRS-F and of the original BRS are almost equal. The BRS-F demonstrated good levels of reliability and meaningful correlations with mental health symptoms and burnout. The resilience-mental health difficulties link was fully mediated through emotional exhaustion. Thus, the BRS-F is a psychometrically sound assessment of self-perceived resilience, which is now available to researchers and clinicians in French-speaking contexts. The results also suggest that the BRS-F is relevant for use by healthcare professionals who may benefit from interventions aimed at increasing their resilience.
