Adaption solutions for improved climate change resilience
Patricia Carbonell, RESIST Communication Contact at REVOLVE â€“ Communicating Sustainability, discusses adaptation solutions for improved climate change resilience in European regions. Europe must undertake transformative adaptation to become more resilient to the climate crisis. In the ethos of leaving no region behind, the EU-funded project RESIST focuses on co-developing climate solutions, innovations and technologies in four experienced regions in collaboration with eight less climate-resilient areas of Europe.
