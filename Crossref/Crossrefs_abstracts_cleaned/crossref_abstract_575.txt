Disaster Storytelling has become a topic of interest in various fields that address disaster risk reduction. The purpose of this study is to establish this concept as a tool for building a disaster-resilient society. An extensive literature survey showed that Disaster Storytelling has two major functions: disaster education and promoting recovery from disasters. This study shows that these two functions can be attributed to reciprocity, which is inherent in storytelling. Our primary conclusion is that, along with recent trends in Disaster Storytelling, such as disaster tourism, the practice will be expanded, the network of Disaster Storytelling activities will be reinforced, and Disaster Storytelling will contribute to the development of a more resilient society.
