Objective: Mental health in people with chronic diseases undergoes many changes due to conflict with the pain caused by the disease, which can have a reciprocal effect on the course and quality of the patient's treatment. The goal of the present study is to compare the correlation between locus of control, relationship quality, pain intensity and resilience with dialysis adequacy and laboratory indicators in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients.
Method: This causal-comparative study was conducted on 30 hemodialysis (HD) and 30 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients through the convenience sampling method. The data was collected using Pierce Quality Relationship Inventory (QRI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Rotter’s Locus of Control Scale (RLOC), and Von Korff’s Chronic Pain Grade Scale (CPGS), and experimental data collected through blood and urine sampling and analyzed with Fisher's test and multivariate analysis of variance.
Results: Conclusion of the Fisher test evinced that there was a significant difference between quality of relationships with parents and amount of Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P) and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) as well between quality of relationships with friends and amount of Creatinine (Cr), and between the intensity of pain with K and Albumin (Alb) in patients with PD and HD (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Conclusion of analysis of variance showed that the mean scores of quality of relationships with friends, K, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Cr, Alb and PTH in the PD group were significantly lower than the mean scores of HD patients (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Also, mean of dialysis adequacy in patients with PD was significantly higher (P < 0.01).
Conclusion: Based on findings, in order to increase dialysis adequacy of patients, along with medical interventions, psychological variables and mental health improvement of patients should also be considered.
