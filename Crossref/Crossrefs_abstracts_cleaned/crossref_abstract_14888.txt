We characterize niobium nitride (NbN) λ/2 coplanar waveguide resonators, which were fabricated from a 10-nm-thick film on silicon dioxide grown by sputter deposition. For films grown at 180 °C, we report a superconducting critical temperature of 7.4 K associated with a normal square resistance of 1 kΩ, leading to a kinetic inductance of 192 pH/◻. We fabricated resonators with a characteristic impedance up to 4.1 kΩ and internal quality factors Qi&gt;104 in the single photon regime at zero magnetic field. Moreover, in the many photon regime, the resonators present a high magnetic field resilience with Qi&gt;104 in a 6 T in-plane magnetic field and in a 300 mT out-of-plane magnetic field. These findings make such resonators a compelling choice for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments involving quantum systems with small electric dipole moments operated in finite magnetic fields.
