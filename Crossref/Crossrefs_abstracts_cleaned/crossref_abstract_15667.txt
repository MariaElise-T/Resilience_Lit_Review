Abstract
The following study is aimed at investigating the construct validity of the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 25) on a Romanian military population. The exploratory factor analysis was conducted on 434 male military participants, aged between 24 and 50 years (M = 34.83, S.D. = 6.14) and the confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on a sample of 679 military participants, of 605 men and 74 women, aged between 18 and 59 years (M = 38.37, S.D. = 9.07). Factor analysis of the scale showed it to be a bidimensional, rather than a multidimensional instrument, as the original five-factor structure was not replicated in this military Romanian sample. Moreover, EFAs suggested that a 14-item bidimensional model should be retained and CFA confirmed that this model fit the data best.
