 This study tested the impact of the skills-building component of a two-semester risk and resilience (R&R) course on the stress, coping skills, and cognitive style of 36 undergraduates compared to 62 students enrolled in a child and adolescent psychopathology course. In the fall, students learned about risk taking and decision-making as well as coping skills and positive cognitive styles. In the spring, students taught these skills to ninth graders. Upon completion of the fall semester, R&R students reported improvements in stress, coping, and dysfunctional attitudes. Although maintained, these gains did not increase after the spring semester. We conclude that the course, particularly the fall semester, is an effective, practical classroom intervention for reducing stress and improving resilience in undergraduates.
