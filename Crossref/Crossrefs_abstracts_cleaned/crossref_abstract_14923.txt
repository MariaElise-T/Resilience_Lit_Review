The current course of the 21st century has challenged humanity as a whole in terms of the operationalisation of large-scale changes, both quantitative and qualitative, one of the directions for changing social functionality being subsumed under global technological governance. Trends specific to emerging and disruptive technologies, technological superiority, digital diplomacy and sovereignty, innovation ecosystems etc. have a major impact on a macro-indicator of analysis of contemporary global performance, namely resilience. The pace of implementing the solutions characteristic to these advanced technologies is a dynamic one, practically influencing all areas of activity. At the military level, there are concerns of interest at the level of NATO member states regarding space systems, robotics and advanced conventional weapons systems (laser, hypersonic weapons), innovative resources, digitisation, artificial intelligence, cyber security etc. In this context, the present article brings to attention some presumptive aspects regarding the modification of managerial resilience, in terms of military roles and responsibilities, starting from classical managerial theories. Directions for exploring the subject proposed by the title which are of interest to military decision-makers are also presented.
