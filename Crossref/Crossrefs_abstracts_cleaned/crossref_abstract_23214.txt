Time difference of arrival (TDOA) based indoor ultrasound localization systems are prone to multiple disruptions and demand reliable, and resilient position accuracy during operation. In this challenging context, a missing link to evaluate the performance of such systems is a simulation approach to test their robustness in the presence of disruptions. This approach cannot only replace experiments in early phases of development but could also be used to study susceptibility, robustness, response, and recovery in case of disruptions. The paper presents a simulation framework for a TDOA-based indoor ultrasound localization system and ways to introduce different types of disruptions. This framework can be used to test the performance of TDOA-based localization algorithms in the presence of disruptions. Resilience quantification results are presented for representative disruptions. Based on these quantities, it is found that localization with arc-tangent cost function is approximately 30% more resilient than the linear cost function. The simulation approach is shown to apply to resilience engineering and can be used to increase the efficiency and quality of indoor localization methods.
