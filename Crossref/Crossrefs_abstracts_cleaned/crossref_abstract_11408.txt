The present study outlines a methodical methodology for developing an assessment index framework aimed at enhancing the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain. A preliminary version of the evaluation index system was established through a comprehensive review of literature and panel discussions. Two rounds of expert consultation were conducted using the Delphi method to finalize the indicators and their corresponding weights. The assessment criteria for pharmaceutical supply chain resilience comprises of ten primary indicators and sixty-two secondary indicators. These indicators encompass various facets such as the ability to design the supply chain, reserve resources, integrate processes, collaborate effectively, adopt eco-friendly practices, visualize data, and foster a culture of learning. The outcomes of the consultation conducted with experts reveal that the evaluation index system is reliable, as it demonstrates a significant level of attention, coordination, and authority among the experts. The determination of the weight of each indicator in the system was based on the relative significance of various factors in augmenting the resilience of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The development of an evaluation index system offers a systematic approach to evaluate and enhance the resilience of pharmaceutical supply chains, thereby providing a valuable scientific instrument. The results of this study hold potential value for various entities within the pharmaceutical industry, such as pharmaceutical companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Specifically, these findings may aid in the identification and resolution of potential weaknesses within the supply chain, the enhancement of management practices, and the fortification against external disruptions. Prospective investigations may center on the implementation of the assessment index system in practical scenarios, scrutinizing its soundness and dependability, and investigating methods to consistently enhance the robustness of pharmaceutical supply chains.
