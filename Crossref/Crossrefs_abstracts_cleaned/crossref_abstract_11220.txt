In today's dynamic business environment, numerous organizations are turning to cloud ERP implementation to enhance their operational efficiency and maintain uninterrupted business operations. Consequently, the literature has witnessed a surge in research at the intersection of cloud ERP and enterprise resilience (ER) over the past decade. This paper aims to present a systematic literature review (SLR) and the authors contribute to the existing literature by (1) exploring the connection between cloud ERP and ER, (2) analyzing how cloud ERP supports three key elements of ER—readiness, response, and recovery—and the intertwined mediators and moderators, and (3) proposing a conceptual framework at the nexus of cloud ERP and ER. The review concludes with suggestions for fruitful future research. Not only does this SLR carry several theoretical implications for the literature on cloud ERP and its impact on ER but also provides decision-makers with comprehensive insights into how cloud ERP reinforces ER, thereby ensuring the continuity of business operations in the turbulent business landscape.
