Abstract
The paper focuses on a critical infrastructure reliability and resilience to its operation process and particularly is devoted to critical infrastructure reliability and resilience indicators. First, the model of critical infrastructure reliability without considering outside impacts is proposed and applied to determine the port oil terminal reliability indicators. In the next step, the operation impact model of critical infrastructure reliability is created and applied to reliability and resilience analysis of the port oil terminal. The comparison of the port oil terminal critical infrastructure reliability indicators without considering outside impacts with indicators considering impact of its operation process is performed. A significant influence of the operation process on the port oil terminal reliability is proved.
