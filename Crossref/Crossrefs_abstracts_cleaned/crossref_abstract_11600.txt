This study aims to examine the perspective of public sector resilience development, which 
is explored as a three-stage construct: Planning, Adaptation, and Enhanced Learning. 
We analyzed whether these three stages are equally important in developing 
organizational resilience in the public sector. To assess the developmental importance 
of the three stages of organizational resilience, this study adopted a quantitative 
methodology. First, expert research was conducted to analyze whether all three stages 
were equally important in developing organizational resilience. Second, the level of 
resilience of public sector organizations in Lithuania was assessed by analyzing the 
survey results of 401 organizations. The results revealed that according to experts, the 
Adaptation stage is the most important in developing resilience, while Enhanced 
Learning is the least important. Meanwhile, resilience assessment in the Lithuanian 
public sector showed that Planning and Adaptation were equally developed, while 
Enhanced Learning demonstrated a significantly higher score.
