The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a large-scale crisis that has also impacted the well-being and, more specifically, the life satisfaction of university students. Factors such as attachment dimensions and psychological resilience can provide us with a better understanding of students’ life satisfaction levels during the recent pandemic. While previous literature has revealed a significant association between attachment dimensions, resilience, and life satisfaction, very few studies have attempted to address a more complex relationship among all three variables for university students, and even fewer have explored this topic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of attachment dimensions on university students’ life satisfaction after the fourth wave of COVID-19 in Cyprus, with a focus on the mediating role of psychological resilience. The sample comprised 780 university students, consisting of 323 men and 457 women, aged between 18 and 61 years. Participants were recruited electronically, and after being directed to Google Forms, they completed the ECR-R for their attachment dimensions, the RES for psychological resilience, and the SWLS for life satisfaction. The results indicated significant correlations between attachment dimensions, psychological resilience, and life satisfaction. Notably, psychological resilience was found to partially mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety, as well as attachment avoidance, and life satisfaction. Specifically, attachment anxiety and avoidance negatively affected life satisfaction, partially due to lower levels of psychological resilience. These findings are discussed in relation to the existing literature, and implications for practice are provided.
