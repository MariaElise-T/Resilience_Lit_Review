This article provides the research community with a conceptual framework from a historical perspective of the impulse of education sustainability in the official international literature. In addition, the United Nations International Conferences held on Japanese territory in order to foster education for risk reduction and for training resilient individuals and communities are analyzed. The study of the content of both approaches, education for sustainability and education for risk reduction, constitute an innovative approach especially relevant after the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 crisis. The article advances with a historical analysis of the use of the concept of resilience in the European Institutionsâ€™ official documents. Our findings show that it is particular after 2015 when resilience is linked to sustainability. Before this, the European approach was mostly linked to food crises and emergencies. The article offers a synthesis of the global and European approaches in tables so that we can compare the progress in the United Nations discourse and the European Union one. In this conceptual framework, we offer a contribution to the debate for European national education systems. In particular, we offer contribute to the debate of the Organic Law LOMLOE approved in Spain in 2020, in which education for sustainability is strongly considered but not so much resilience education. The article intends to contribute to the inclusion of resilience as an element of the curriculum linked to the education for sustainability.
