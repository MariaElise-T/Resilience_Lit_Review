 While the goals of long term sustainability and survival were thoroughly studied in family firms’ literature, to the best of our knowledge, rare studies had investigated the influence of values on the capacity of family firms to be resilient. In addition, this likely relationship is highly contingent on cultural and national contexts, as family values – on which family business values are dependent – are not the same across countries and World regions. These theoretical and empirical gaps motivated the present research which aims at investigating the probable influence of family firms’ values on the resilience of these firms in the unique context of Tunisia.  This qualitative research is based on a body of discourse collected from nine managers belonging to five Tunisian family businesses. Our research allowed us to highlight some key family business values in a new underexplored setting that is an oriental country with a culture driven by Islamic and Arab values. More importantly, our analysis shows that family values underlie both community and business values. Finally, our results underscore the importance of business values, community values and family values in the resilience of the firms studied.
