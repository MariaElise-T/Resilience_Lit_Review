The goal of this paper is to use the variable returns to scale (VRS)-slacks-based measure (SBM)-data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to compare the energy resilience of different economies and areas. This study looks at the energy resilience scores of 26 economies from Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific area. It does this by looking at twelve sub-indicators in three dimensions: society, the economy, and the environment. According to the computational results, seventeen of these economiesâ€™ total energy resilience achieved top-tier performance. South Korea, ranked 18th, is only second to these seventeen economies and is followed by, among others, Turkey, Luxembourg, Poland, Italy, Belgium, the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Twelve of the twenty European economies, all three American economies, and two Asia-Pacific economies are relatively energy-resilient. There are sixteen economies in society dimensions, seventeen economies in economy dimensions, and seventeen economies in environment dimensions that are relatively energy-resilient. Sub-dimensional improvement suggestions for relatively less energy-resilient economies are provided according to empirical results. The outcome of the research provides policymakers with a benchmark for future policy planning. Due to data limitations, this study cannot benchmark all OECD economies and does not account for sub-dimensional resource inputs.
