 This article examines the biography of adolescents who emigrated from Venezuela with family members due to economic hardship. It aims to highlight how a common crisis produces a variety of experiences, but that resilience is a central aspect of all life courses. It analyzes the stages of the adolescentsâ€™ migratory trajectory: their departure, journey, and settlement in Peru. The results show that the crisis homogenises the living conditions and produces a heterogeneity of migration experiences in which resilience is ever-present.
