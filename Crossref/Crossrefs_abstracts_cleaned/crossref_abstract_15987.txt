This study aimed to identify post-traumatic growth and successful aging and the mediating effects of resilience and intolerance of uncertainty in breast cancer survivors. This study employed a descriptive survey approach. Data were collected from 143 breast cancer survivors between 27 January and 10 December 2021, at a cancer center in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea. SPSS/WIN 25.0 and PROCESS Macro version 3.5 were used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were analyzed with SPSS. PROCESS was used to conduct a mediation analysis and the significance of the mediating effect was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals. Successful aging was significantly associated with post-traumatic growth, resilience, and the intolerance of uncertainty. The impact of post-traumatic growth on successful aging was mediated by resilience in breast cancer survivors. Resilience should be considered when developing nursing interventions to enhance post-traumatic growth and promote successful aging in breast cancer survivors.
