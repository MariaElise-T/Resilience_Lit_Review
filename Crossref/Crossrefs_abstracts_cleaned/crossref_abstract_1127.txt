Resilience is a self-healing method featured with positive emotional outcomes. Religious attitudes are of the probable grounds of development of resilience techniques among women who have been victim of domestic violence. The present study is aimed at determining correlation between religious attitudes and resilience among women with domestic violence. The present study is a descriptive correlative research. Selected Health centers in east and north districts of Tehran affiliated with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Data gathering tools were a demographic information questionnaire, Connor-Davidson’s Resilience scale, and Serajzadeh’s “Muslim Religiosity questionnaire”.</p><p>We used Pearson correlation test to indicate the presence of correlation between resiliency and religious attitudes. Data analyses were performed in SPSS 16. Mean and standard deviation of religious attitudes and resilience among the women with domestic violence were 76.41±9.96, 68.46±15.68 respectively. The results showed that there was correlation between religious attitude and resilience among women who have been subject to domestic violence. (P&lt;0.001, r=0.24). Women under domestic violence had stronger religions attitudes and higher resilience strength. It appears that resilience among women subject to domestic violence and the effective factors on resilience and religious attitudes in particular (given the role of religion in Iranians’ lives) deserve special attention.</p>
