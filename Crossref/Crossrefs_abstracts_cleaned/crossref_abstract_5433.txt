This study from the "ecological environment-infrastructure-social livelihood-economic development" four aspects of urban toughness evaluation framework and index system, in 2012-2020 as the research object, based on GIS analysis platform, using entropy method, spatial autocorrelation, linear fitting and other spatial analysis method, Jiangsu urban toughness temporal differentiation evolution pattern, and reveal the influence mechanism through geographical detector. The study found that: (1) from the perspective of the spatial differentiation pattern, high in the south and low in the north, cold in the north, southern Jiangsu is the core area of high toughness hot spots, showing point distribution; northern Jiangsu is low toughness cold point area, showing surface distribution. (2) The spatial and temporal differentiation pattern of urban resilience in Jiangsu Province is formed by the interactive influence of ecological environment, infrastructure, social and people's livelihood, economic development and other factors, among which economic development is the dominant factor.
