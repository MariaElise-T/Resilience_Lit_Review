Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication technology is an emerging technology that can connect smart wireless devices. The most obvious feature of M2M is that the communication between devices does not require human intervention. Therefore, ensuring the low-energy consumption of M2M devices is a necessary condition for prolonging the survival time of their devices. This paper first considers the coexistence of M2M and H2H scenarios. Aimed at the energy efficiency of M2M equipment and the channel capacity of H2H equipment, a multiobjective problem is constructed for joint spectrum and power resource management, and a weighted Chebyshev algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Secondly, in view of the additional interference problems caused by the introduction of M2M communication, the intercell cooperative link selection algorithm is used to optimize its resilience. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proven by simulation results.
