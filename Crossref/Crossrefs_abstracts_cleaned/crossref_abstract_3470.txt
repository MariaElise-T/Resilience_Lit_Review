Buildings globally are subjected to climate change and heatwaves, causing a risk of overheating and increasing energy use for cooling. Low- energy cooling solutions such as night cooling are promising to realize energy reduction and climate goals. Apart from energy performances, resilience is gaining importance in assessing the performance of the building and its systems. Resilience is defined as “an ability to withstand disruptions caused by extreme weather events, man-made disasters, power failure, change in use and atypical conditions; and to maintain capacity to adapt, learn and transform.” However, there is a clear lack of Resilience indicators specific for low energy cooling technologies. In this paper, the resilience of the night cooling in a residential building in Belgium is assessed for two external events: heat wave and shading failure. This paper shows the first attempt of a resilience indicator for night cooling as the effect on the shock of solar shading failure, heat wave or combination of both. It take 3.4 days to bring down the temperature below 25?, in case of shading failure and heatwaves compared to 9 hours in the reference case. Further research is needed to determine resilience indicators as a performance criteria of low-energy cooling systems.
