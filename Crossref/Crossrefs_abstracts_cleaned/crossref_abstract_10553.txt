Building a resilient and stable supply chain has become an important strategy for many countries. Studies have shown that the application of additive manufacturing (AM) technology in construction can help offset the negative impact of “black swan events” on supply chains. This study examines the construction industry based on AM technology and analyzes the impact of changes in the industry chain on the supply chains. The specific factors that affect the resilience of AM construction supply chains were identified through literature research and expert interviews, including 7 dimensions and 21 secondary indicators. An intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IFAHP) evaluation model was established. Finally, an example of an AM construction manufacturer, YC Enterprise, was introduced to quantify the various factors and determine the weights. The results show that the essence of building a supply chain with AM is creating a closed-loop supply chain. The impact of AM construction manufacturers on supply chain resilience (SCR) is the most critical, followed by that of regulatory authorities and general contractors. The AM construction SCR assessment index system and evaluation method constructed in this paper have important significance in filling the gap in the quantitative evaluation of the impact of AM on supply chains.
