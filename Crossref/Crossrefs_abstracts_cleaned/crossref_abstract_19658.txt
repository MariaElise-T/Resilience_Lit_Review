 Resilience, or multilevel processes related to thriving, offers a strengths-based approach to reducing HIV and sexual risk behaviors among girls and young women. Processes of resilience may change based on the experience of living with HIV. However, little is known about how resilience and serologically verified HIV status influence sexual health. Using weighted cross-sectional data collected during 2017–2018 from South African girls and young women aged 15–24 (N = 7237), this article examines associations between resilience and three sexual risk behaviors among those living with and without HIV. Logistic regression models indicated greater resilience scores were associated with reduced odds of engaging in transactional sex and early sexual debut. Results also identified differing associations between resilience and sexual risk behaviors by HIV status. Findings provide implications for programming to prevent HIV and improve sexual health while underscoring the need for tailored resilience-promoting interventions for South African girls and young women living with HIV.
