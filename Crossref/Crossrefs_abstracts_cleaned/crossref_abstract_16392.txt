 Children, especially girls, are more vulnerable during crises, who need to acquire skills such as social self-efficacy to meet the challenges of the environment. Given that, much progress has been made in e-learning; its capabilities can be used to promote children’s health. This study aimed to determine the effect of virtual resilience training on the social self-efficacy of elementary school girls. This experimental study was performed on primary school girls aged 9–10 years in southeastern Iran. Students were selected by convenience sampling and divided into intervention ( n = 40) and control ( n = 37) groups by using randomized allocation. The Children’s Social Self-Efficacy in Peer Interaction Scale was used for data collection before, immediately, and one month after the intervention. No significant difference was found between the two groups of intervention and control in the score of social self-efficacy before the intervention. However, the score of students in the intervention group improved immediately and one month after the intervention, and a significant difference was observed between the two groups ( p = .0001). Virtual resilience training has improved the social self-efficacy of elementary school girls and facing challenges is inevitable in today’s world, so resilience training seems necessary to prevent social and psychological harm in such children.
