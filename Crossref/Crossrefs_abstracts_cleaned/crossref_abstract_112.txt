 The construct of resilience describes situations in which people overcome negative consequences typically associated with high levels of risk. This study applied the construct of resilience to family systems looking at ways families are able to maintain high functioning despite facing difficult experiences. A mixed methods study was conducted to test relationships between the variables of risk, family strengths, and family functioning. Quantitative findings suggest that families do experience resilience. The variable of family strengths predicted higher levels of family functioning despite the level of risk. The results lend empirical support to the use of strength-building in family practice. Qualitative results and relevance of the entire study are presented in an upcoming second article (Part 2).
