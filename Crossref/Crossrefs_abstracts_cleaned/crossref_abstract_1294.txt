Subgrade resilient modulus (MR) is very important for effective design of pavements. Several methods to estimate the resilient modulus were suggested in the past years. The main objective of this paper was to validate the correlation of MR with other physical properties of the subgrade soils. Cohesive soils representing major soil types in Shanghai were selected. The resilient modulus tests were conducted with UTM. Additional analysis was then performed to develop correlations between the model parameters and other soil properties. To verify the prediction models independently, laboratory MR tests were conducted on new subgrade soils. It was observed that the predicted MR values compared well with the laboratory measured values for the soil samples.
