Using grounded theory, this study identified factors that contributed to childrenâ€™s ability to utilize their resilient attributes. Children between the ages of 9 and 12 from high-conflict separated or divorced families participated in a study that examined how family and community interactions promote resilient behaviour. Substantive-level theory gained from this study yielded that children from separated or divorced, high- conflict families exhibit resilient characteristics when family cohesion is used to incorporate additional family support systems, particularly step- parents and extended family members. External support systems, particularly peers, augment these resilient characteristics. In order to build resilience in pre-teen children parents need to encourage relationships with external and internal support systems.
