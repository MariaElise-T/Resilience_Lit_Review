This research begins by comprehensively exploring previous research related to community resilience and what steps are used to increase community resilience in reducing disaster risk. Conceptually, it is known that the fatigue model accumulated by the time system, infrastructure system, governance system, regulatory system, and hazard system for disaster risk reduction is often associated with weakening community resilience. It is often associated with catastrophic events, which are sometimes predictable and unpredictable. In manual decision-making, people are aware of the inconsistency of subjective decisions. A decision support system hypothesizes that it will take less time to explore data to make faster and more informed decisions. As a result of this concept, it is possible to reduce the number of wrong choices when dealing with disaster risk reduction issues. In terms of disaster risk reduction, the power of decision support systems is discussed in this paper to find a framework for its effectiveness as relative decision making will differ on different dimensions of Resilience.
