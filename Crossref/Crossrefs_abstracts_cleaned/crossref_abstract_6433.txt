Compiled in this Special Section are recommendations from multiple experts on how to maximize resilience among children at risk for maladjustment. Contributors delineated processes with relatively strong effects and modifiable by behavioral interventions. Commonly highlighted was fostering the well‐being of caregivers via regular support, reduction of maltreatment while promoting positive parenting, and strengthening emotional self‐regulation of caregivers and children. In future work, there must be more attention to developing and testing interventions within real‐world settings (not just in laboratories) and to ensuring feasibility in procedures, costs, and assessments involved. Such movement will require shifts in funding priorities—currently focused largely on biological processes—toward maximizing the benefits from large‐scale, empirically supported intervention programs for today's at‐risk youth and families.
