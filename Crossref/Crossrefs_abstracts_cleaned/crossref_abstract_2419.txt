This extended abstract shares research factors that affect gender equity in the workplace, along with subsequent workplace interventions that have been trialed at Santos to address the research findings.
A collaborative initiative between several leading universities and companies across a range of industries was established to identify challenges associated with gender representation in the workforce. A number of key research areas were focused on, including bias and its effects on gender equity, resilience in the workplace, and factors that affect retention and attrition of women in the workplace.
Findings

Unconscious and conscious bias needs to be tackled directly and through open intervention. Bias in manifested in judgments and decision-making that affect women's working conditions. Removing biased decision-making through awareness programs, education and direct challenge has a positive impact on diversity and productivity.
Resilience builders can differ by gender. Interventions in the workplace to build resilience for women need to include confidence building. Successful women can suffer confidence crises as often as less successful women. Women are more likely to establish the confidence needed to be resilient in organisations when there is a culture of psychological flexibility.

This extended abstract will share the application of the research findings to the Santos workplace. For example, how decision making and bias training at Santos has assisted a broad range of disciplines, and what effect resilience-building strategies have had on productivity and culture.
