AbstractRechargeable battery production should yield highly diversified batteries, overcoming performance degradation caused by the complexity of production processes, dynamic disturbances, and uncertainties. Resilience must be achieved to overcome these limitations while satisfying the core technical requirements. This study developed an architectural framework for a cyber-physical production system (CPPS) using a digital twin (DT) to achieve resilience. Activities for resilience, operational characteristics, and CPPS were analysed to determine the core requirements. This analysis presents a novel model of activities for resilience. Moreover, the DT-based CPPS architecture, service composition procedures, and the asset description for providing inputs to the elements in the CPPS were designed according to these requirements. The proposed architectural framework applies the asset administration shell principles for efficient interoperability. The service composition procedures are classified into the type and instance phases to ensure static and dynamic technical functionalities. Moreover, the asset description is suitable to indicate the required information elements of rechargeable battery production. The DT-based CPPS was applied in a rechargeable battery production for an industrial case study to verify and validate the proposed method. The average accuracy of the DT application was 95.24%, indicating that it can provide technical functions with high accuracy. As a result, these technical functions can be executed within a sufficient action time, and the high simulation accuracy prevents performance degradation during production. Additionally, the DT is suitable for event diagnosis and provides a dynamic response. Furthermore, the proposed method can eliminate the data, analysis, and decision latencies.
