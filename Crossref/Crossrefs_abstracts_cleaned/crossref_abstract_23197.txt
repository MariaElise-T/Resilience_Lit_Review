The article touches upon the issue of empirical study of the emotional sphere characteristics of working youth and such resource factors as resilience, job satisfaction and interpersonal relations. The sample consisted of 163 people aged 18 to 27 years old. The results obtained showed that the majority of respondents (service workers) formally fulfill their professional duties without personal inclusion and empathy. A high level of gen-eral resilience is characteristic of those who are less susceptible to emotional burnout. With increasing length of service the level of emotional burnout increases, at the same time, an increase in enthusiasm for work is able to reduce this level. Comparative analysis based on gender: girls have higher indicators on the scales “general level of emotional burnout” and “emotional exhaustion” than boys. Emotional indices of girls are more typical than in the group of boys. Working girls, unlike working boys, are characterized as easily excitable, they experi-ence all events that occur with them more intensively and for a longer period of time. Working girls more often than boys are exposed to manifestations of emotional instability. Correlations between the emotionality pa-rameters and indices of interpersonal relations have been revealed. As such, the characteristics of emotionality are higher in respondents who need emotional contact with others.
