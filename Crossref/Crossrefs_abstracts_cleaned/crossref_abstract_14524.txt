AbstractThe accurate weighting of pseudorange observations is important to improve the convergence time and positioning quality of Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Currently, the weight of a pseudorange observation is mainly determined with empirical stochastic models. However, in a complex environment, due to the inability to adapt for the dynamic changes of the user environment, the empirical stochastic models usually cannot reflect the real error level of pseudorange observations. To address this problem, a resilient adjustment method to weigh pseudorange observations is proposed, which constructs the real-time estimation and inflation model for the variance of pseudorange multipath error and measurement noise to replace the empirical stochastic model to determine the weights of pseudorange observations. A set of static and dynamic Global Positioning System (GPS) test data are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The test results indicate that the proposed real-time estimation model can provide a better representation of the pseudorange accuracy, and the positioning performance of PPP using the real-time estimation model is better than that with the empirical stochastic model. Compared with the optimal empirical stochastic model, the positioning accuracy of PPP with the real-time estimation model is improved by at least 20%, and the convergence time is reduced by at least 50%.
