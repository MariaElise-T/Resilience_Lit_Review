This paper focuses on the adaptive control problem of a class of uncertain time-delay nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with both unknown time-varying deception attacks and full-state constraints. Since the sensors are disturbed by external deception attacks making the system state variables unknown, this paper first establishes a new backstepping control strategy based on compromised variables and uses dynamic surface techniques to solve the disadvantages of the huge computational effort of the backstepping technique, and then establishes attack compensators to mitigate the impact of unknown attack signals on the control performance. Second, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced to restrict the state variables. In addition, the unknown nonlinear terms of the system are approximated using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and the Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii function (LKF) is introduced to eliminate the influence of the unknown time-delay terms. Finally, an adaptive resilient controller is designed to ensure that the system state variables converge and satisfy the predefined state constraints, all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded under the premise that the error variables converge to an adjustable neighborhood of origin. The numerical simulation experiments verify the validity of the theoretical results.
