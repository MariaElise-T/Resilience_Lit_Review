 This research examines whether transit-oriented development (TOD) contributes to housing value resilience in Atlanta, Georgia. We developed two spatial hedonic models using property sale records to examine whether being located in TOD areas contributes to the resilience of housing prices during and after the Great Recession, compared to being located in transit-adjacent development areas. Our results suggest that there is a growing demand for TOD properties in recent years, which contributes to maintaining and faster regaining property values in TOD areas. Our results support future investment in TOD areas and also suggest challenges to incorporating affordable housing in TOD designs.
