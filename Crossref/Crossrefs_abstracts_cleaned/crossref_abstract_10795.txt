Abstract
Discrimination is a chronic psychosocial stressor that can accelerate aging. While strong empirical evidence demonstrating linkages between discrimination and adverse health outcomes, the role of discrimination in multimorbidity burden has received less attention. Prior research on discrimination and health largely uses a single, static, cross-sectional measure to predict health at a second time point, that may mask significant heterogeneity in the dynamic nature of repeated exposures to discrimination. Characterizing longitudinal patterns of discrimination may be a better predictor of health risk and provide insight on resilience processes that influence aging-related outcomes such as multimorbidity. However, this relationship is not well understood. We investigate the association between discrimination trajectories, resilience characteristics, and multimorbidity burden among a sample of middle-aged and older black adults. Specifying discrimination trajectories and resilience characteristics that differentially predict multimorbidity burden may inform the design of culturally-relevant interventions to delay the development and progression of multimorbidity.
