Planning and developing resilient socio-technical and natural systems to cope with and respond to unprecedented changes has been one of the top goals of government bodies, researchers, and practitioners worldwide. This study aims to review how resilience is defined and evaluated in water resources and infrastructure systems (hereafter water systems) and propose a framework to analyze and incorporate resilience in the system. Two questions guide the review: How is resilience defined in water systems compared to other disciplines? What are commonly used resilience measures and methods applicable to water systems? Based on the review, a resilience analysis framework has been proposed. The framework uses a system of systems approach and applies hierarchical holographic modeling to address the complexity of interdependent systems. The resilience of the systems was analyzed using three questions: resilience of what, resilience to what, and resilience for whom. Two resilience measures selected for the analysis are robustness and rapidity. The framework also includes methods for uncertainty analysis, options for resilience strategies, and multi-criteria decision analysis methods to select optimal resilience options. The review is not exhaustive due to the broader topic but aims to present necessary background information to support the proposed framework.
