The coordinated scheduling of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging should be constructed in distributed architecture due to the growing population of PEVs. Since the information and communication technology makes the adversary more permeable, the distributed PEV charging coordination is vulnerable to cyber-attack which may degrade the performance of scheduling and even cause the failure of scheduler task. Considering the tradeoff between system-wide economic efficiency, distribution level limitations and PEV battery degration, this paper investigates the resilient distributed coordination of PEV charging to resist cyber-attack, where the steps of detection, isolation, updating and recovery are designed synthetically. Under the proposed scheduling scheme, the misbehaving PEVs suffering from cyber-attack are gradually marginalized and finally isolated, and the remaining well-behaving PEVs obtain their own optimal charging strategy to minimize the total system cost in distributed architecture. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of theoretical method.
