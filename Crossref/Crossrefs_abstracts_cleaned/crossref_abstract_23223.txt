Objectives This study aimed to explore the resilience, stress, and stress coping strategies of non-disabled students who have siblings with disabilities. The study also investigated the differences based on gender and school grade, as well as the correlations between these variables.
Methods A survey was conducted with 89 non-disabled students who have siblings with disabilities from 8 private developmental rehabilitation centers in Gwangju, Jeonnam, and Jeonbuk. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis were used to analyze the data.
Results First, there was no significant difference in resilience and stress coping strategies for non-disabled students with siblings with disabilities; however, stress levels were higher among female students compared to male students. Second, as school grade increased, resilience also increased, while stress coping strategies decreased. Third, resilience showed a negative correlation with stress and a positive correlation with stress coping strategies.
Conclusions Based on these findings, it is suggested that support programs are needed to enhance the resilience and stress coping strategies of non-disabled students who have siblings with disabilities, and to improve the quality of life for both the disabled siblings and the non-disabled students.
