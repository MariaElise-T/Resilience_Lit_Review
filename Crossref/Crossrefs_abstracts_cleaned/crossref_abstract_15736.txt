The aim of this study was to validate and adapt the academic-resilience scale in the Spanish context. The study involved 2967 university students aged 18â€“33 (Mean, M = 23.65; Standard Deviation, SD = 2.57) from several universities in Andalusia (Spain). Exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses revealed adequate adjustment rates for the new version of the scale showing the factorial structure invariant with respect to that generated. Three factors that integrate the scale obtained high correlation, internal consistency, and temporal stability. The Spanish version of the academic-resilience scale was shown to have adequate psychometric properties to measure academic resilience in the Spanish university context.
