AbstractIn this study, a model for the evaluation of a building's resilience and recovery time is proposed, and a new method is developed for the optimal viscous damper placement for a targeted resilience. The features of this model are as follows: 1) building components are categorized into systems in view of their functionality, 2) recovery time is regarded as a function of the damage to building components and human resources for repairing the components, 3) the model is applicable to structural design. This design method uses a type of real‚Äêcoded genetic algorithm (GA). The effective use of a constraint on the sum of the added damper damping coefficients enables an efficient search for the solution.
