Communication is an essential aspect of preparing for, avoiding or responding to the occurrence of natural geohazards. As such, it forms an integral part of any strategy to enhance resilience to geohazard events. Conversely, inadequate or lack of communication is a common factor in failing to minimise the risks involved. Communication about geohazards occurs at several different levels: between geoscientists and other professionals such as the engineers and planners; between professionals and other groups such as emergency services and insurance companies; and between all of these parties and the general public who are affected by events. Geoscientists need to be involved in all of these lines of communication. This paper examines the essential role of geoscientists in helping to reduce the risks associated with a wide range of geohazards. A series of key principles that links to a generic model of geohazard communication applicable to a wide range of scenarios is presented
