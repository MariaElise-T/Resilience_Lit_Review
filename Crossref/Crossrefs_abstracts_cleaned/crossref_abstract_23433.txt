Under the dual impact of urbanization and ecological crisis, rural ecological resilience research can improve the systemâ€™s level of resisting external pressure and restoring ecological balance and provide a new perspective for sustainable rural development. This study establishes a rural ecological resilience measurement system in Weiyuan based on the PSR framework, evaluates the level of rural ecological resilience in Weiyuan in 2021 using the entropy method and the GWR model and detects its driving factors. The results show that (1) the spatial characteristics of rural ecological resilience diverge significantly, with the ecological resilience level of the three southern forest farms being higher overall the high values of resilience in Qingyuan, Wuzhu and Xiacheng being distributed in the central villages, while other villages are at low and medium values (2) X5 and X7 have negative driving effects on village ecological resilience, and X1, X5, X9 and X10 have positive driving effects on village ecological resilience (3) the dominant drivers and characteristics, we construct a scheme on stressor repair, state adaptation transformation and response efficiency optimization to provide ideas for improving rural ecological resilience.
