Long-lasting stress factors, both biological and psychological, are commonly accepted as the main cause of depressive disorders. Several animal models, using various stressful stimuli, have been used to find biochemical and molecular alterations that could help us understand the etiopathogenesis of depression. However, recent sophisticated studies indicate that the most frequently used animal models of stress only capture a portion of the molecular features associated with complex human disorders. On the other hand, some of these models generate groups of animals resilient to stress. Studies of the mechanisms of stress resilience bring us closer to understanding the process of adapting to aversive stimuli and the differences between stress-susceptible vs. resilient phenotypes. Especially interesting in this context is the chronic mild stress (CMS) experimental paradigm, most often using rats. Studies using this animal model have revealed that biochemical (e.g., the dopamine D2 receptor) and molecular (e.g., microRNA) alterations are dynamic (i.e., depend on stress duration, 2 vs. 7 weeks) and much more pronounced in stress-resilient than stress-susceptible groups of animals. We strongly suggest that studies aimed at understanding the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of depression must consider these dynamics. A good candidate to serve as a biomarker in such studies might be serum microRNA, since it can be obtained relatively easily from living individuals at various time points.
