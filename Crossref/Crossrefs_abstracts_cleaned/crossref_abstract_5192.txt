In Republic of Korea, pronounced seasonal precipitation variability poses substantial challenges for stream water quality management and the effective utilization of water resources. Ecologically degraded streams are particularly vulnerable to these fluctuations, which can exacerbate their already fragile condition. We assessed the resilience of reference and impaired streams in response to rainfall through water quality system performance (WQSP). The WQSP is quantified as the concentration of BOD, T-N, and T-P, which represent streamsâ€™ eutrophication and anaerobic conditions and respond quickly to disturbances. Reference and impaired streams are classified according to the biological condition and habitat environment of the streams in the Han River watershed of Republic of Korea. The resilience of the stream ecosystem was estimated using WQSP, the linear multiple regression model, and the generalized additive model for rainfall and WQSP. The WQSP reference streams have a lower sensitivity to disturbance and recover more quickly from the influence of rainfall; therefore, they have higher resilience than impaired streams to rainfall events. This study facilitates understanding changes in stream ecosystems of varying conditions in response to rainfall for ensuring long-term stability and adaptability.
