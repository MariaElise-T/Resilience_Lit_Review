Although many research studies have been performed on vulnerability assessment and hazard mitigation, it is extremely hard for communities to cope with disasters appropriately. There are many uncertainties and unanticipated issues in disasters; therefore, coping with disasters and emergencies is not as simple and easy as mitigation and preparedness activities. The concept of disaster resilience has been described as a method to overcome unforeseen problems. This paper aims to discover and prioritize dimensions and components of Disaster Resilient System (DRS) in urban areas using Delphi, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). Numerous frameworks and models have been used to define relevant dimensions and components of DRS based on the Delphi method. The relationship between the components has been determined using DEMATEL. Finally, obtained data has been applied to ANP to define a conceptual model and to obtain a weighted supermatrix for prioritizing the main components of DRS. The results of the study have shown that a Comprehensive Emergency Plan (CEP) is the most important component for earthquake resilience in urban areas.
