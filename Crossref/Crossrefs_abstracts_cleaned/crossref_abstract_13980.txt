Abstract:  This article highlights the potential of developmental psychopathology as a useful integrative perspective for the challenging task of linking the study of brain development and adolescent behavior in context; it considers clues from behavioral research on resilience on the nature of regulatory processes as risks and assets, or vulnerabilities and protective factors for the development of competence and psychopathology in adolescence; and it advocates more integrative neurobehavioral research on risk and resilience in adolescent development.
