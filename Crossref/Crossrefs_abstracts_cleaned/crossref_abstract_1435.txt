Food insecurity has gained considerable global attention in the past two decades, ranking top of the Millennium and Sustainable Development Goals. Although the subject has received considerable research, it was largely centred on describing the incidence of food insecurity and vulnerability; with food availability and access often the domains of focus. Limited research was done to strengthen the importance of food insecurity risk in order to inform programming and decision making for reducing future vulnerability, strengthening population resilience and early warning measures. Meanwhile, statistically robust analytical approaches are now available for determining potential food insecurity risk, especially in protracted crisis.
