AbstractResilience theory plays a critical part in the practical design of modern engineered resilient systems that comprise of cyber‐physical systems and components having interdependencies intended to make the whole system robust. In this paper, the percolation‐based metric is utilized to quantify the communication systems' resilience. Because there is no consistent and reliable way to measure resilience, the percolation‐based metric framework is developed to model the component or system failure by removing fractions of the nodes or links, causing the network to transition from functional to non‐functional. The efficacy of the percolation‐based metric model is demonstrated by using the power grid and maritime platform systems (legacy and future design versions) as case studies. The results from the analysis of the maritime communication and power grid systems are presented. The results indicate that percolation‐based metric may be a useful approach for system engineers and designers to gain improved insight into the quantification of communication system resilience.
