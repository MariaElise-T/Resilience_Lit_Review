Abstract
This paper proposes a linear quadratic regulator-based control scheme to ensure the stability of power grids against cyber-attacks. The proposed control scheme is developed for the synchronous generator in a power system having a single generator. In this work, the nominal system represented by a linear state-space model is augmented by considering the impact of cyber-attacks and the Riccati equation for the augmented system is solved in such a way the attack is completely eliminated. The attack is considered on the actuator, i.e., within the dynamical model of the synchronous generator in a power grid. Simulation studies are conducted under different attacks on the actuator and results under all attack scenarios ensure attack resilient operations of power systems.
