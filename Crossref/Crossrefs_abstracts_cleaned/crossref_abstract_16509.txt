            The current study used a grounded theory approach to develop a substantive theory of the process of building resilience in adult children of parents with alcohol use disorder (ACOAs). Seventeen ACOAs selected by purposive sampling underwent in-depth interviews. Results demonstrated that ACOAs' resilience developed in four phases: exposure, awareness, action, and adaptation. The core category of the construction process of ACOAs was
            accepting reality in the collapse of everyday life and becoming myself
            . The central phenomenon grounded in the process of developing resilience was
            trying to maintain my daily life
            . The current study suggests that appropriate intervention strategies are needed at each phase of development to address the particular needs of ACOAs in that phase. [
