Vernacular environment presents the learned lessons
transferred to the inhabitants in terms of sustainability and resilience. On
the contrary, stakeholders participated in the administrative tasks display
inconsistent approaches towards the historic built environment especially in
Gölcük, Kocaeli. After the 1999 earthquake urban transformation projects as new
constructions and improper conservation practices without any values of the
area threatens the continuity of the cultural heritage. The discussions were
mainly focused on two different neighborhoods Örcün and Saraylı having
relatively intense vernacular buildings in the periphery of Gölcük. The
post-disaster studies revealed that architecture tissues were dramatically
changed in the favor of reinforced concrete especially in urban areas. Three
main objectives were sought in order to evaluate the resilience after 20 years
in terms of urban, architectural and social aspects. It is aimed to determine
the current conditions of listed and non-listed traditional structures; to
assess the impact of vernacular systems on the new built environment and to
reveal the social tendency toward new urban policy with traditional ingenuity
and technology.
