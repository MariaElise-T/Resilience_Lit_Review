AbstractObjectiveTo examine the interrelationships among resilience, self‐esteem, and depressive symptoms and determine whether resilience was a factor associated with quality of life for Hong Kong Chinese children with cancer.MethodsWe used a cross‐sectional study design. Participants were 138 Hong Kong Chinese children (aged 7–14 years) who were admitted to the pediatric oncology units of an acute public hospital. The resilience, depressive symptoms, self‐esteem, and quality of life of participating children were assessed. The primary outcome was the association between resilience and quality of life in children with cancer.ResultsIn total, 72 boys and 66 girls were recruited for this study (mean age 10.6 years). The mean levels of resilience, depressive symptoms, self‐esteem, and quality of life were 23.4, 30.0, 23.0, and 63.6, respectively. There was a statistically significant strong positive correlation between resilience and quality of life (r = 0.60, p < 0.01), indicating that greater resilience was associated with better quality of life. Children with cancer from single‐parent families, those diagnosed with a brain tumor, and those who received multiple treatments reported significantly lower levels of resilience, self‐esteem, and quality of life, and greater depressive symptoms than other children (all p's < 0.001). Results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that resilience (p < 0.001) was a strong factor associated with quality of life among children with cancer.ConclusionsIt is essential that healthcare professionals implement interventions to boost the resilience of children with cancer, thereby enhancing their quality of life.
