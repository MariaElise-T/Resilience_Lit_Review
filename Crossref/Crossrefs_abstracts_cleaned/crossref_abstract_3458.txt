Abraham Maslow was among the first to hypothesize that most emotional and behavioral problems stem from unmet needs. Now, a large body of research on brain science, trauma, and resilience validates this concept. Humans experience emotional pain when their needs are frustrated. The most basic biosocial needs are for attachment, achievement, autonomy, and altruism. When these needs are met, children thrive. When they are not met, children experience pain-based emotions, thinking, and behavior. This article explores research and practical strategies for responding to the needs beneath pain-based behavior instead of reacting to problems.
