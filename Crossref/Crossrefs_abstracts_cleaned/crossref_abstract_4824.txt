Purpose
 – This study aims to explore how insurance organisations interpret organisational resilience; to identify potential objectives, elements and practices of organisational resilience within insurance organisations; and to investigate the impact of culture on resilience. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – An empirical study in the insurance industry in Jordan was undertaken. The population consists of all 28 insurance companies registered at the Amman Stock Exchange. Data were collected via a survey questionnaire followed by three semi-structured interviews. 


Findings
 – Results revealed that respondents understand the meaning of organisational resilience differently. Various factors constitute organisational resilience in Jordanian insurance organisations. Nevertheless, some key factors that have the potential to improve organisational resilience were missing. Culture influenced the level of organisational resilience considerably. 


Practical implications
 – This study provides insights into the factors that enable organisations to withstand future risks, which, in turn, ensures long-term survival. It also reveals how culture affects the level of organisational resilience. This paper provides a basis for policymakers in Jordan to start actively considering existing resources and cultural trends to introduce new frameworks for improving resilience in the insurance sector. 


Originality/value
 – This study is made in the context of an emerging economy; Jordan. It uses quantitative and qualitative research approaches. It is also one of the few studies to discuss resilience in relation to culture and within the insurance sector.
