AbstractSevere and prolonged social stress induces mood and cognitive dysfunctions and precipitates major depression. Neuroinflammation has been associated with chronic stress and depression. Rodent studies showed crucial roles of a few inflammation-related lipid mediators for chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Despite an increasing number of lipid mediators identified, systematic analyses of synthetic pathways of lipid mediators in chronic stress models have not been performed. Using LC–MS/MS, here we examined the effects of chronic social defeat stress on multiple synthetic pathways of lipid mediators in brain regions associated with stress susceptibility in mice. Chronic social defeat stress increased the amounts of 12-lipoxygenase (LOX) metabolites, 12-HETE and 12-HEPE, specifically in the nucleus accumbens 1 week, but not immediately, after the last stress exposure. The increase was larger in stress-resilient mice than stress-susceptible mice. The S isomer of 12-HETE was selectively increased in amount, indicating the role of 12S-LOX activity. Among the enzymes known to have 12S-LOX activity, only Alox12 mRNA was reliably detected in the brain and enriched in brain endothelial cells. These findings suggest that chronic social stress induces a late increase in the amounts of 12S-LOX metabolites derived from the brain vasculature in the nucleus accumbens in a manner associated with stress resilience.
