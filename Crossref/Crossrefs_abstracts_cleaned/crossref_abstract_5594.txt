With the increasing trend of global aging, the mental health of the elderly has gradually become the focus of the social and academic fields. Psychological resilience is defined as an individual's ability to maintain or rapidly restore psychological and behavioral functioning when encountering difficulties, setbacks, or major stress. This report explores the importance of older adults, the current status of resilience and its key role in coping with life stress by dealing with the existing literature. Studies have found close relationships between resilience and older people's ability to cope with stress, life satisfaction, and social support. At the same time, this report also outlines the utility of psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training and positive psychological interventions in improving psychological resilience, providing theoretical support and practical guidelines for promoting mental health and quality of life in the elderly.
