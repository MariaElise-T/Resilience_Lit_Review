 This research delves into the relatively uncharted territory of Islamic governance and its impact on strategic sustainability and climate resilience planning in Muslim-majority countries. It scrutinizes the role of religious regimes in public administration and policy-making within these nations. The study employs a case study methodology, focusing on 11 strategically chosen countries within the Islamic world, and evaluates their respective climate resilience and sustainable development objectives. Forty-five reports, plans, and government documents from 2017 to 2023 are analyzed using a two-cycle coding process facilitated by software. The paper makes three significant contributions. Firstly, it addresses the academic call for understanding the positive governance of sustainable development and resilience planning in Muslim-majority countries, specifically focusing on the role of religious regimes. Secondly, it reframes the general understanding of governance in public administration related to resilience planning in Islamic countries. Lastly, it offers an understanding of religious regimes to analyze climate resilience planning. The analysis reveals several thematic categories, each representing a different resilience and sustainability planning governance aspect. The studyâ€™s results suggest that nations with the most effective plans tend to have robust economies, comprehensive educational institutions, pluralistic societies, inclusive governments, and liberal religious regimes, all of which positively influence sustainable development and climate resilience planning.
