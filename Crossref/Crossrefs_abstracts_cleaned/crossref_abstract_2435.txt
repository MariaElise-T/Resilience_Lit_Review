The aim of present research is to study the combined effects of two variables, namely, mindfulness and resilience on one outcome measure, namely, Burnout as well as investigating the relative contribution of mindfulness and resilience to reduce Burnout among college students. Individuals face persistent stress and demands in their personal and professional lives and remain at a constant risk of Burnout due to academic work, pressure and high competition. Burnout affects the mental health and performance of young adults. Mindfulness and Resilience have been recognized as protective factors against Burnout and helps to cope with the stress associated with it. The study composed a sample of 74 individuals (Male=34, Female=40) using The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI-S). Quantitative research design has been used and Regression analysis found significant predictors (Mindfulness and Resilience) of Burnout. The obtained results for regression analysis, the F= 11.081, p<0.001 values indicates that the concerned factors have significant impact on Burnout and the R2 value found 0.238 which depicts 23.8% of the total variance for Burnout. It concluded that increased Mindfulness and Resilience among college students leads to lower feelings of Burnout. Interventions, trainings, workshops and counseling become necessary in educational perspectives to provide the coping strategies with the negative outcomes of Burnout through practices of Mindfulness and Resilience.
