Abstract
With the development of distributed generation, energy supply to the transportation industry through microgrids has become a reality. However, in recent years, affected by environmental changes, extreme weather has occurred frequently. Due to the simple topology, the safe operation of microgrids has been threatened. Therefore, it is necessary to analysis and assess the resilience of microgrids. At the same time, due to the high penetration rate of distributed generation, the microgrid can be reconfigured during extreme disasters to form distributed generation islands to ensure the power supply of local loads. This paper first introduces the resilience curve and resilience index of the expressway microgrid, and then proposes a mathematical model for network reconfiguration to improve the resilience of the microgrid. Finally, the resilience assessment method proposed in this paper is used to assess the resilience of an expressway microgrid under extreme storm weather, then, the reconfigured system is obtained by solving the model, which verifies the effectiveness of this method in improving the resilience.
