Abstract
The concept of a sustainable city that has been described in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires all cities in the world to implement it to solve climate problems that if not handled are increasing every year. The impact of climate change, which is a global problem, can affect lives, such as hydrometeorological disasters especially floods. Flood problems can be overcome with the Blue Green Infrastructure (BGI) development approach, one of which is green open space with a retention pond as an effort to achieve the SDGs in the Sustainable City component. Based on this statement, this study will identify in determining the location of BGI development in this case green open space with retention ponds to support the concept of sustainable planning and resilience in one of the metropolitan cities in Indonesia, Jakarta, which is the most populous city that has high rainfall and has minimal open space. The construction of the BGI is carried out as an effort to reduce the impact of climate change in the form of flooding by structural mitigation in the conservation of water balance in urban development, improving water quality, and reducing rainwater runoff and peak flows. This research was carried out in stages in the form of identification of urban land cover changes with image crawling as justification for the massive addition of built-up land, identification of vegetation density and temperature with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and flood hazard, with identification of retention pond needs. Eventually, recommendations for BGI development locations were given based on changes in urban land, temperature, vegetation, and flood hazard as well as the fulfilment of supporting infrastructure needs.
