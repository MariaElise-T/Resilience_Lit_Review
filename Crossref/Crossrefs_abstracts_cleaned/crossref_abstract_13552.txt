The COVID-19 lockdown has deepened inequity among vulnerable groups, such as the elderly. Reducing inequity in access to essential service facilities is an effective way to improve community resilience in dealing with pandemics. In this research, three indexes were created to measure community resilience in accessing essential services. Specifically, we have considered the different walking capacity and different needs of the elderly and the general population. We selected Shanghai as the case for our research and analyzed the spatial patterns of both space-based and population-based essential service facilities. The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient were used to measure the spatial equity. And, we attempted to reveal the relationships between the population density and three indexes through bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association. The results suggest that the Diversity Index enjoys the highest equity, followed by the Demand Accessibility Index, and the equity of the Per Capita Quantity Index is the lowest. Furthermore, the accessibility of essential services in urban areas is excellent, while in some suburban areas it is low. Our findings contribute valuable scientific insights for policy makers to strengthen community resilience and address inequities for immediate or long-term measures.
