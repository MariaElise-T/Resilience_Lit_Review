Objective We aimed to explore how nursing students’ adherence to physical distancing, sense of belonging, or resilience may be associated with viral anxiety during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era in South Korea.Methods We conducted an online survey among nursing students from December 8–10, 2021. The survey gathered participants’ age, sex, grades, living area, and responses to questions on COVID-19. In addition, responses to Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), adherence to physical distancing, Sense of Belonging Instrument, Calling and Vocation Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 (CD-RISC2) items were gathered.Results The SAVE-6 score was significantly correlated with adherence to physical distancing (r=0.29), PHQ-9 (r=0.26), and CD-RISC2 (r=-0.34, all p<0.01) similar to partial correlation analysis adjusting participants’ group (freshmen and sophomores vs. juniors and seniors). A linear regression analysis revealed that viral anxiety of nursing students was predicted by sex (female, β=0.20, p=0.001), adherence to physical distancing (β=0.25, p<0.001), sense of belonging (β=0.16, p=0.014), and CD-RISC2 score (β=-0.32, p<0.001) (adjusted R2=0.24, F=10.01, p<0.001).Conclusion We observed that adherence to physical distancing, sense of belonging, and their resilience influenced nursing student’s viral anxiety. An appropriate support system to manage viral anxiety is needed for nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
