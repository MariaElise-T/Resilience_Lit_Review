As new urbanization constantly develops, the county economy plays a vital role between country and city, and high economic resilience is necessary to support and safeguard for smooth functioning of the county development. The paper constructs the index system of county economic resilience in Henan Province from three dimensions: risk resistance ability, self-stability, and sustainable development ability, and to empirically analyze the economic resilience of 104 counties and cities in the province from 2013 to 2020 using the entropy weight-normal cloud model. The results show that Henan countiesâ€™ economic resilience increases slowly over time and decreases spatially from the center to the surrounding region, with Zhengzhou as the main center and Luoyang and Sanmenxia as the subcenter; risk resistance ability and self-stabilization are more influential than the sustainable development ability; the key indicators affecting economic resilience are GDP per capita, retail sales of social consumer goods per capita, financial self-sufficiency rate, education expenditure per capita, and population mobility. Therefore, the counties in Henan should find the right positioning to improve economic resilience; central cities such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang should play their strong functions, while strengthening support for peripheral counties.
