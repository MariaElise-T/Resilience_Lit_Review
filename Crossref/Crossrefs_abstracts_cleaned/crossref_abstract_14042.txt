This study aimed to determine and prioritize the critical barriers to supply chain resilience (SCR) in Vietnamese small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), which play a crucial role in the global supply chain. Through a systematic literature review and expert consultation, 15 barriers to SCR were identified and evaluated by using the fuzzy VIKOR (ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method. The findings provide novel insights into the challenges of enhancing resilience in the Vietnamese supply chain and categorize the barriers into three main categories: the resilience phase, strategy resilience, and the competencies required. The results indicated that a lack of financial resources and alternative sources of supply are the most pressing barriers related to the resilience phase group. In terms of strategy resilience, the lack of a skilled and competent workforce was found to be the most critical obstacle. Furthermore, government delays in supporting and enacting appropriate policies were found to be the most pressing issue related to the competencies required. These findings offer valuable recommendations for managers seeking to address these barriers and enhance the resilience of the Vietnamese supply chain after COVID-19. By prioritizing and solving these critical obstacles, Vietnamese SMEs can better prepare for and recover from potential challenges in the future.
