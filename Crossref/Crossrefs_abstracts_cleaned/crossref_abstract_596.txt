The purpose of this study is to identify the relative contribution of South Korean middle school students' ego-resiliency, parenting style, and peer attachment in predicting their school adjustment. For this purpose, only South Korean 7th graders’ cross-sectional data of 2016 were extracted from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) and then, using SPSS version 24.0, analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression. The results were as follows. First, there were significant positive correlations between ego-resiliency, parenting style, peer attachment, and school adjustment variables, except for some relationships within and between sub-variables of them. Second, ego-resiliency, parenting style, and peer attachment made a significant prediction for school adjustment and its sub-variables in order of ego-resiliency, parenting style, and peer attachment. Subsequently, the present research discussed these findings’ implications with the previous works.
