 Men are a hard-to-reach group in the promotion of modifiable behaviors such as physical activity. Examining the individual differences among men that might predict positive behavior changes could support customization of health promotion programs. This study examined the role of emotional outlook, positive emotion, and ego-resilience in determining men’s physical activity and health-related quality of life following implementation of a gender-sensitive workplace health intervention. Using a pre–post within-subjects design, computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) was used to collect measures of emotion and ego-resilience along with physical activity and health-related quality of life (using the 12-item short form [SF-12]) at baseline ( n = 139) and after 6 months ( n = 80) from adult men ( Mage = 43.7, SD = 12.5). Baseline emotional outlook and ego-resilience were both positively related to increased physical activity at follow-up among men. Emotional outlook and positive emotion were positively related to ego-resilience, and ego-resilience mediated the relationship between these and the physical component of health-related quality of life. Workplace health interventions that incorporate the promotion of personal resources hold potential for greater impacts.
