AbstractObjectiveIn cultures where psychological distress is stigmatized, the presentation of emotional distress as somatic complaints is a frequent occurrence. Understanding factors that contribute to the presentation of somatization in Latinx immigrants is crucial due to its tie to poor quality of life. The purpose of this study was to explore relations among acculturative stress, anxiety, somatization, and resilience in a sample of Latinx immigrants living in the United States.MethodsData were collected from 204 Latinx immigrants across diverse community settings.ResultsAcculturative stress was positively related to both anxiety and somatization, and the relation between acculturative stress and somatization occurred through anxiety. Resilience moderated the relations between acculturative stress and somatization, and between anxiety and somatization.ConclusionThis study suggests that Latinx immigrants presenting with somatic symptoms may benefit from the examination of a possible comorbid presentation of anxiety or acculturative stressors. An integrated behavioral healthcare approach is recommended when working with Latinx immigrants evaluating the impact of minority stressors on health. Clinicians are encouraged to incorporate cultural protective factors that reinforce the development and sustenance of resilience.
