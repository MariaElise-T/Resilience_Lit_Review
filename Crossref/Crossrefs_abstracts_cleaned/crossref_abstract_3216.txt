The interaction between bank survival and agro production was used to investigate the extent of economic resilience. To achieve the general objectives of the study times series, data from the world bank data base and macro trends .net was sorted for the independent variables (bank survival, agro-production and capital formation) and the dependent variable (economic resilience) from 2013 through 2021. Different statistical test was conducted through the aid of econometric views version 9.0. The study found that BASU, AGPR, and CAPF has an insignificant influence on ECRE but only CAPF seem to have a positive relationship with ECRE. The study recommended that government authorities should facilitate additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. The study suggested amongst others that: the variables of the study for further research should include other factors like inflation, exchange rate so on that impacts economic resilience; the time frame for subsequent research should be adjusted to reflect contemporary events and comparative analysis should be embark on say empirical analysis between Nigeria and some other west Africa or Africa countries.
