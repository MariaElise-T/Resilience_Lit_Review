AbstractBackground and AimsThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has significantly impacted the psychological well‐being of healthcare workers globally. However, little is known about the mental health state of frontline health workers in the postpandemic era. The purpose of this study was to examine postpandemic COVID‐19‐related psychological distress and fear among frontline health workers in Ghana.MethodsData were collected from 245 frontline healthcare workers in the Western region of Ghana. COVID‐19‐related fear, psychological distress, and resilient coping were assessed with the fear of COVID‐19 scale, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the association between psychological distress and fear of COVID‐19 as well as the moderating effects of resilient coping.ResultsParticipants were mostly female (57.1%), aged between 21 and 30 years (50.6%), and not married (58.0%). We found that 52.2% of frontline healthcare workers experienced mild‐to‐severe fear, while 40% experienced psychological distress. Fear of COVID‐19, previous contact with COVID‐19 patients, and earning a monthly income between 501 and 1000 Ghanaian cedis were significantly associated with higher psychological distress. The positive association between fear of COVID‐19 and psychological distress was stronger among frontline health workers who had higher resilient coping.ConclusionThere is the need to provide frontline health workers with mental health support services to promote their psychological well‐being and enhance their ability to provide quality care during the postpandemic era.
