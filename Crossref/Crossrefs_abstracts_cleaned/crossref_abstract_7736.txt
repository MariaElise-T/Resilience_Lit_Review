This research investigates the impacts of organizational learning and resilience on adaptive performance within the banking industry during the 4IR. This study implemented a cross-sectional survey approach, having its sample (250 employees), purposively obtained from five (5) Lagos State of Nigeria’s banks. These five (5) banks are First City Monument Bank Limited, Zenith Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc, Guarantee Trust Bank Plc, and First Bank of Nigeria Plc. The current researchers encouraged voluntary participation and guaranteed respect for related ethical matters. Two hundred and forty-six (247) surveys were successfully retrieved and suitably utilized. Data recovered was cleaned and analyzed with Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS vs. 28). This paper confirms that organizational learning and resilience independently and significantly increase and sustain positive adaptive performance. This investigation also found that organizational learning and resilience significantly and jointly impact adaptive performance. Hence, management within Nigeria’s banking industry should consider adopting more organizational learning programs and exercises for the varied circumstances and contests from the fourth industrial revolution. Moreover, the management and leaders within Nigeria’s banks should adopt human resource practices that cultivate the mastering of transformative activities, making the most disruptive surprises that potentially impend organization survival in the fourth industrial revolution
