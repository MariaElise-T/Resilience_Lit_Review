AbstractMonitoring and evaluation of funded activities is essential to improve the effectiveness of spending and accountability of climate finance, as well as for transparency and learning. This chapter shares early experiences and emerging lessons from developing the Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) participatory results‐based monitoring and reporting system. It describes the process of developing the PPCR results framework and takes a critical look at its five core indicators. It then discusses the iterative and participatory development process of the PPCR Monitoring and Reporting Toolkit, as well as progress made and challenges encountered in operationalizing the monitoring and reporting system. The purpose of this system is to track progress toward climate‐resilient development at the national level and to monitor, report, and learn from the implementation of PPCR activities at country and project level. The chapter also highlights opportunities to complement monitoring and reporting with evidence‐based learning. A summary of lessons learned concludes the chapter.
