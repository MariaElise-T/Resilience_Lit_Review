This research paper deals with experimental characterisation and numerical modelling of the resilient behaviour of Unbound Granular Materials (UGMs) usually used in road construction. The first part of this paper describes the main results of an experimental program that was carried out to assess the mechanical properties of two local Unbound Granular Materials (UGMs) for construction purposes in road pavement. The second part of this paper is devoted to the numerical modelling of the resilient behaviour of UGMs used in flexible pavements. For this purpose, several nonlinear unbound aggregates constitutive models are implemented within an axi-symmetric finite element code developed to simulate the nonlinear behaviour of pavement structures. In addition, deflection data collected by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) are incorporated into the analysis in order to assess the sensitivity of critical pavement design criteria and pavement design life to the constitutive models. Finally, conclusions of engineering significance are formulated.
