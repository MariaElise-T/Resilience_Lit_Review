Resiliency, Control, Enjoyment and Physical Activity in African American High School StudentsThe purpose of this study was to explain physical activity (PA) using Block and Block's (2006a) ego-resiliency and ego-control theory along with measures of self-control and PA enjoyment. One-hundred and seventy-seven African American high school students from a large Midwest inner city participated. In general, cluster analyses provided support for the importance of ego-resiliency and PA enjoyment as there were strongly affiliated with differential amounts of PA. Ego-control and self-control were also important in cluster formation but related to PA in somewhat unexpected ways.
