AbstractThis article investigates the problem of event‐based resilient and robust  control for semi‐Markov jump systems (S‐MJSs) under stochastic cyber attacks. It is assumed that the uncertain S‐MJS is threaten by stochastic cyber attacks characterized by two different functions. To save the resource of bandwidth limited network, the dynamic event‐triggered (DET) scheme is adopted to reduce the total number of released data through the transmission channel. In addition, the actuator fault, the signal quantization, and the asynchronous phenomenon of the controller are taken into consideration simultaneously, which makes the analysis and synthesis more practical. Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stochastic stability of the system with a predefined  performance. Then the co‐design of resilient controller gains and weighting matrices of the DET scheme is presented in terms of a group of feasible LMIs. Finally, simulation examples are given to validate the proposed method.
