    To measure threshold conditions of tourism destinations, the study proposes resilience indicators that were derived from multiple community resilience models. Five input capitals, (economic, social, institutional, infrastructure, and visitors), along with the indicators are proposed to produce a single composite destination resilience score that allows for comparisons among multiple destinations. To illustrate their utility, the paper applies the indicators to two major tourism destinations: Orlando, Florida and New Orleans, Louisiana. Data were gathered through multiple sources (e.g., census data, STR Trends Report, County Business Pattern of North American Industry Classification System). The results suggest that tourism destinations can increase their resilience by using the proposed indicators   to target specific programs, plans, or investments. These indicators provide a first step in understanding the dimensions of destination resilience and the fundamental variables contributing to it.
