In order to make video transmission more stable, various error-resilient mechanisms are proposed on video coding in the literature. However, the redundancy mechanism behind classical redundant coding algorithms is relatively simple and is not suitable for the network environment and video content in the context of screen content sequence with multiple abrupt frames and still frames. Motivated by this, a frame-level coding selection mechanism is proposed in this paper for the error-resilience transmission of screen content, where additional code stream or redundant information is considered to improve error-resilient performance with redundant coding and acceptable video quality is obtained in the case of frame transmission error. In addition, selective allocation redundancy is conducted to take the importance of the video frame ROI (region of interest) area into account in the co-encoding process. As a result, the redundancy insertion efficiency and the reliability are improved in return. The corresponding experiments validate the effectiveness of the schemes proposed in this paper.
