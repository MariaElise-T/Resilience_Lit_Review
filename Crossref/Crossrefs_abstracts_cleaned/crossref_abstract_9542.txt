 A pandemic will impose considerable demands on communities over a period of several weeks; thus, people must develop means to facilitate their resilience in such an event. This article describes the development and testing of a model to inform public education strategies to facilitate the sustained adoption of the preparedness and protective measures that underpin community resilience. The model is derived from the premise that decisions to act reflect how people interpret information to make it meaningful to them. The model describes how this outcome reflects the interaction among personal beliefs about preparing, community characteristics influencing how risk beliefs and risk management strategies are developed, and the relationship between the community and health information sources. It highlights a need to distinguish those who decide not to prepare from those who accept a need to prepare but need guidance. Implications for developing pandemic public education and risk communication programs are discussed.
