			<p>Based on panel data from 31 provinces in China between 2011 and 2020, we empirically studied the impact of the digital economy on urban resilience using fixed-effects models, threshold-effects models and spatial Durbin models. Our research findings indicate that (1) the development of the digital economy has a significant positive impact on the enhancement of urban resilience; (2) the promotional effect of the digital economy on urban resilience varies significantly across different regions; (3) the promotional effect of the digital economy on urban resilience exhibits a typical double-threshold characteristic due to the different levels of development in digital financial inclusion and (4) the digital economy has a positive spillover effect on the urban resilience of surrounding areas. Therefore, we should actively promote the development of the digital economy and digital financial inclusion, making the digital economy a new driving force for promoting urban resilience.</p>
