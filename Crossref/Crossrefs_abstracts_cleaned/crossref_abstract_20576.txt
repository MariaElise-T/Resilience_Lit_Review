Purpose This study examined the mediating role of resilience and living in care experiences between risk exposure (victimization by community and adverse childhood experiences) and psychosocial outcomes (housing instability, delinquency, and post-traumatic stress reactions) for youth receiving child welfare and community services. Method Two hundred and fifty-one youths (14â€“19 years old) who are receiving interventions from the Department of Community Services in Nova Scotia, Canada, were recruited. Multiple measures were administered to the youth. Results and conclusion Resilience and experiences of living in care significantly mediated the relationship between risk factors and outcomes, with youth demographic characteristics influencing the pattern of these relationships. Findings suggested that resilience and living in care experiences could reduce the effects of risk factors on psychosocial outcomes. These findings demonstrate a role for Child Welfare agencies in promoting youth access to the resilience-enabling resources necessary to sustain well-being.
