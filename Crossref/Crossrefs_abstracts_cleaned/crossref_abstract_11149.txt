This study examined caregiver burden among home caregivers of COVID-19 patients and its relationship to resilience. This cross-sectional correlational study was conducted in Mashhad, Iran, in 2020. The sample consisted of 220 family caregivers of COVID-19 patients. The data collection tools included: demographic characteristics, Novak and Guest Caregiver Burden Inventory, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and correlation test in SPSS v25. The mean score of caregiver burden was 76.85±16.25. In total, 4.5% experienced mild caregiver burden, 31.4% moderate caregiver burden, 50.9% severe caregiver burden, and 13.2% very severe caregiver burden. The mean score of resilience was 62.98±14.06. A significant and inverse relationship was observed between caregiver burden and resilience (p < 0.05, r = -0.46). Family caregivers of COVID-19 patients experienced a significant level of caregiver burden, and it was lower in caregivers with higher levels of resilience. Further studies are recommended in this regard. The use of procedure and training that can improve the resilience of caregivers is recommended to nurses, especially home care nurses.
