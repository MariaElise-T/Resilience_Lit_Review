 The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity of the Adolescent Resilience Scale which measures the psychological features of resilient individuals. Research involving this scale, the Negative Life Events Scale, and the General Health Questionnaire was conducted with a group of 207 Japanese undergraduate students (104 men and 103 women; M age = 20.2 yr., SD =.9). A cluster analysis for the Negative Life Events Scale and General Health Questionnaire yielded three clusters: (1) mentally healthy with little experience of Negative Life Events, (2) poorer mental health with many experiences of Negative Life Events, (3) mentally healthy despite many experiences of Negative Life Events. These three groups were defined as (1) Well Adjusted, (2) Vulnerable, and (3) Resilient, respectively. Mean differences in scores on the Adolescent Resilience Scale among the three groups were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. The mean scores of both the Well Adjusted and Resilient groups were higher than that of the Vulnerable group, and therefore support the construct validity of the Adolescent Resilience Scale.
