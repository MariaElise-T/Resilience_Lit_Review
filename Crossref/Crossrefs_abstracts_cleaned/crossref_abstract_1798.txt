 The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant effect on the vulnerable portion of society, particularly on Indigenous and visible minority immigrants. We, as a minority family from Bangladesh who are on Indigenous land in Saskatchewan Canada, explore family-based pandemic resiliency, mainly focusing on Indigenous notions of resistance and reconnection. This article discusses our family-based resiliency on family interaction, social distancing, and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper explores a family-based decolonizing autoethnography as a methodology for understanding health and wellness from an immigrant family’s perspective. We discussed why Indigenous and immigrant stories matters for building resiliency and resistance within a family. How do we know it is effective? How can it be helpful for others? Here, we highlight how Indigenous Elders, Knowledge-Keepers, and ancestors’ stories helped us for building our resistance and reconnection to be active, hopeful, and joyful during the COVID-19 pandemic.
