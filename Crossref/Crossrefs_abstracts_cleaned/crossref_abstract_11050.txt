 The demographic transition with rapid urbanisation corresponds with the challenges of urban infrastructure development. Urban health is an outcome of complex interaction of many urban factors including governance and finance. Coupled with this, climate change has overarching influence on these factors and a challenge to development, health and survival. Therefore, understanding impact of climate change with reference to urban health and development should be on high priority.  Changes in climatic patterns may alter the distribution of vector species and increase its spread in new areas. An increase in temperature and relative humidity may enlarge the transmission window. Effluent emissions to water bodies and salination of rivers through sea level rise may increase the incidence of water borne diseases. Deaths due to heat wave are reported from several parts of the country. Every city is different and success of city specific urban health programme depends on city specific planning as well as public health preparedness for climate change. Hence, study of Climate and Health brings out threshold levels of climate resilience.  Surat city experience of Urban health revealed that good governance and Finance were considered most important factors including Urban health system, community participation, Inter-sectoral convergence, disease surveillance, health information system, Public–private partnership, participation of academic institutions and cross learning. One of the major advocacy areas UHCRC is embarking in is ‘Inclusion of Climate resilience in Health and Health in Climate Resilience Planning’.
