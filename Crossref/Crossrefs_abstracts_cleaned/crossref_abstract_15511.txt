AbstractBackgroundEarly‐life disadvantage, including low socioeconomic position (SEP), few resources, and limited education, has downstream effects on cognitive ability. However, personality‐related factors such as having an internal locus of control or a more conscientious personality have been related with greater resilience and ability to cope with adversity. Our objective is to determine if personality‐related factors position individuals to overcome the negative effects of early‐life adversity on late‐life cognitive ability.MethodData comes from the 2015 Mexican Health and Aging Study. First, we estimate each respondents’ expected cognitive ability (ŷ) given their markers of early‐life disadvantage by regressing observed, age‐normed, late‐life cognitive ability (y) on markers of early‐life disadvantage (own and parental education, parental occupation, and markers of early‐life SEP) to identify a subsample expected to be in the lowest quartile of cognitive ability given their early‐life. Second, we use this subsample (n=2,214) to investigate how personality‐related factors (locus of control and conscientiousness) relate with one’s odds of ultimately having above median observed cognitive ability (y) using logistic regression.ResultRespondents in the lowest quartile of expected cognitive ability based on early‐life disadvantage had an average of less than a year of education, had parents with little education, and endorsed more markers of low early‐life SEP. However, 21% ultimately ended up above median cognitive ability. Among those in the lowest quartile of expected cognitive ability, having a more internal locus of control (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06‐1.13) or more conscientious personality (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05‐1.12) were independently related with having above median cognitive ability. Living in an urban area, and greater wealth were also associated with having above median cognitive ability.ConclusionOur findings suggest that individuals with an internal locus of control and a conscientious personality are better able to “break the link” between early‐life disadvantage and poor cognitive function later in life.
