Abstract
There is a significant diversity in approach to ‘resilience’ in the context of mental health recovery following experiences of psychosis, varying from clinically measurable outcomes to a personal trait within a recovery ‘journey’. Given the contested nature of resilience within mental health literature, this study aimed to complete a scoping review to synthesise understandings of resilience by individuals with experiences of psychosis. Drawing on the holistic and person-centred principles that underpin social work approaches to mental distress, these perspectives are considered in the statutory, policy and critical contexts of British social work, establishing learning for practice. A meta-synthesis of qualitative studies was completed, drawing on searches of five databases (Social Care Online, APA PsychInfo, Cinahl, Medline and Web of Science), identifying twelve relevant papers. A thematic analysis identified three overarching themes (personal, social and professional factors) and eight associated sub-themes (personal responsibility, use of experience, coping strategies, peer support, social relationships, contribution, relationships with professionals and structured support). The study identifies systemic and life-course approaches as empowering service user engagements with psychosis, recovery and resilience, suggesting that the social work profession is well placed to engage with resilience enhancement in the context of mental health recovery.
