COVID-19 has manifested as a global epidemic, with significant patient presentations for treatment and increased human resource workloads. Pharmacists are front-line healthcare professionals who play a critical role in medication management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they play a unique function in the healthcare system. Due to staff shortages and increased demand for services both before and after the epidemic, pharmacists' workloads have become unsustainable, putting them under additional stress. Hence, it is expected that many pharmacists would be suffering from the daily unpredictable workload which might worsen their level of employee well-being. Ensuing from this finding, a comprehensive framework concerning the connection between work-family conflict, resilience, and employee well-being is proposed. This paper is a conceptual paper that aims to draw attention to the current change of work nature and the effect of work-family conflict on the resilience and well-being of community pharmacists. The target respondents are community pharmacists located in Greater Kuala Lumpur. Primary data will be collected by distributing questionnaires and subsequently the data will be empirically tested with structural equation modelling by using partial least squares analysis (SEM-PLS). The expected output of this study is a comprehensive theoretical framework for employee well-being that involves the connection between work-family conflict and resilience. This study will contribute significantly to the improvement of community pharmacists' well-being and will prompt the search for organizational intervention strategies to address the issue of pharmacists' well-being.
