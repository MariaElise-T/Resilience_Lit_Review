A typical structure-borne noise control configuration consists of a vibrating machine, a set of resilient isolation mounts, a foundation supporting structure, and a building floor or deck. If the floor is represented by an infinite flat plate and the foundation is comprised of structural beam elements, the acoustic power transmitted to the floor can be calculated in exact fashion using the dynamic direct stiffness technique. This analysis approach involves the representation of beam segment properties in terms of dynamic frequency-dependent stiffness coefficients. The solution of dynamic displacement response to a harmonic input force parallels the solution of static deflections to an applied constant load. Calculations of transmitted acoustic power were made for a range of foundation structural parameters and resilient mounting configurations. The results indicate the sensitivity to such design parameters on structure-borne noise transmission.
