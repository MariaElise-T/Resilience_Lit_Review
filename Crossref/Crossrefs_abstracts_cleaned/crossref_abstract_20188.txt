Background and Purpose: This study aims to validate the resilience scale developed by Wagnild and Young for the Portuguese population. Methods: The instrument validation was conducted with a sample of 313 adults attending the Higher Institute of Educational Sciences, of which 62.3% were female and 37.7% male, between 18 and 58 years old. Results: Three factors were decided upon: life satisfaction, planning-discipline, and independence, and there was a positive average correlation between the three factors. The confirmatory factor analysis showed excellent comparative fit index and root mean square error of approximation values, so we conclude that the model has an excellent fit. Also, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient used for internal consistency values reported good values. Conclusions: Overall, the key global indicators of the model’s fit and reliability analysis express their quality for Portuguese population.
