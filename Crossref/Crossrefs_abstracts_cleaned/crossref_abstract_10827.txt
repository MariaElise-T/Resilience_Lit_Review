Abstract  The growing body of knowledge related to resilience supported the need for the development of an instrument that can be used to assess resilience factors, that is, individual protective factors, but to date, no established instrument for Thai adolescents exists. The purposes of this study were to develop and test the psychometric properties of the Resilience Factors Scale for Thai adolescents. Derived from the resilience theory of Grotberg and a literature review, 27 items compose the scale. The content validity was evaluated by five experts. The construct, contrast‐group, and predictive validity, as well as the internal reliability, were evaluated with a multistage random sample of 638 tenth‐to‐twelfth graders in four high schools in Bangkok, Thailand. An exploratory factor analysis in the final step indicated that the scale consists of six components with 25 items. Evidence of validity and reliability was obtained. This scale has demonstrated good psychometric properties and has provided an objective tool for assessing the resilience factors of Thai adolescents.
