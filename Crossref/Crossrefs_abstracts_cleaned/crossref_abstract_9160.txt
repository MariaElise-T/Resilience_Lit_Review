 This qualitative descriptive study explored the experiences of school nurses in coastal Louisiana, who were affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008 and who had also been in the path of destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The purpose of the study was to describe the experiences of school nurses affected by repeated natural disasters in relation to their professional practice. The researchers conducted interviews with five school nurses, using the constant comparative method of data analysis to analyze transcripts for recurrent themes. Findings revealed a common process of developing resilience among participants. As a result of their experiences, participants described the ability to recover and adapt in the face of adversity. Various factors affected this resilience, including preparedness, support from others, both personally and professionally, and commitment to the communities in which they live.
