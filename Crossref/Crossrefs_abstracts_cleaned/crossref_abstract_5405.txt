In view of the flooding problems faced by colleges and universities, we first reviewed current research on flood bearing resilience in order to clarify the ideas put forth by previous studies regarding the improvement of flood bearing resilience. Then, using the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, as an example, a framework for promoting the cooperation of various ecosystems on the college campuses to cope with flooding was established. This framework makes it possible to effectively enhance the flood bearing resilience of the college campus and promote ecological, sustainable development therein. It includes a design strategy for renewal and renovation of college campuses that can improve their resilience to flooding. In partnership with natural systems, semi-artificial and artificial ecosystems on the college campus will be redesigned to cope with rainfall and flooding. In order to increase flood bearing resilience, the proposed strategy involves systematically renovating the site, using the China University of Geosciences, Wuhan (hereinafter referred to as the CUG, Wuhan) and its surrounding area as the experimental object. This strategy of renewal has already been proven effective in and around the koi pond at CUG, Wuhan.
