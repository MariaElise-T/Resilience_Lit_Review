PurposeConsidering the direct impact of retailers' performance on the economy, this paper aimed to propose a comprehensive framework to evaluate the performance of different branches of a retailer.Design/methodology/approachThrough a case study, the weights of indicators were calculated by the best-worst method (BWM) and the branches' performance was appraised using data envelopment analysis (DEA).FindingsThe branches were ranked in terms of performance, and sensitivity analysis and statistical tests were conducted to realize the weaknesses and strengths of the branches. Then, some strategies were proposed using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis to improve the performance of the weak branches.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to previous studies on the evaluation of retailers' performance by proposing a triple framework based on resilience, sustainability and sales-marketing indicators. This paper focused on branches' operations and branches' optimization by improving performance in terms of these three indicators. This paper also offers a qualitative and quantitative analysis of retailers' performance, which has received less attention in previous studies.
