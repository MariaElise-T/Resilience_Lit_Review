The purpose of this study is to analyze COVID-19 pandemic cases using the core system approach, and to confirm that the analysis results are applied to strengthening disaster resilience of communities to prepare for and respond to disasters. In this study, the core system model was used to examine how the conversion process must function to secure desirable output. In the core system, institutions, leadership, commitment (followership) and expertise (competence) are interconnected and interdependent based on values. The components have a desirable orientation for overcoming disasters. The main results are as follows. First, “leadership” and “expertise (competence)” were demonstrated based on communication and professional experience in the activities of the prevention and preparedness stage. Second, the “devotion (followership)” and “value” of medical staff, volunteer groups, and public officials became closer through independent thinking and active participation and cooperation. Third, in terms of ‘institution’, personal quarantine rules in a crisis situation became a reference for social distancing behaviors such as wearing a mask and refraining from close contact and gatherings.
