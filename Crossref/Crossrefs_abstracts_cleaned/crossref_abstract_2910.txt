Background: Female depression has proved to be a substantial public health challenge, given its high prevalence and consequent personal, social, and economic implications. The relationship between depression and resilience seems evident, and studies in this area can help identify effective interventions and support for women with depressive disorders and strategies to prevent depression.
Methods: The present study examines the relationship between depression and resilience using the Beck Depression Inventory â€“ Short Form (BDI-SF) and the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA). A non-clinical Portuguese female population was considered (n=240). A one-way ANOVA and logistic regression were performed.
Results: There was a significant difference in resilience total score and all the sub-scales scores between the groups with and without depression, with non-depressed women manifesting significantly higher resilience than the depressed ones. The predictive analysis showed that individual Self Perception and Planned Future variables might contribute to explaining depression.
Conclusions: Prevention strategies for female depression should be valued in public policies and include analyses and interventions on self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotional reactivity, self-compassion, prospecting and life purpose. This is an important message for both mental health professionals and policy deciders with a strong impact on service provision.
