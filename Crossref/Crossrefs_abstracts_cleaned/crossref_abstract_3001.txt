Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical area requiring 24/7 surveillance, in response to the rapidly increasing frequency of cyber threats. Concurrently, there is a notable amplification in both the allocated budget and the academic interest within this domain. In this cyber risk environment, the success of organizations depends on the weakest link, the human factor. Human errors can be reduced by focusing on the beliefs, values and attitudes guiding employee behavior to protect organizations. In this context, the concept of cybersecurity culture emerges as the key to strengthening cyber resilience in organizations. In this study, the findings obtained from the literature review are presented to determine the definition of cybersecurity culture, its importance and the factors considered important for creating and maintaining this culture. In the study, cybersecurity culture is defined as the set of behaviors formed by beliefs, values and attitudes that shape an organization's approach to cybersecurity. Creating a resilient and sustainable cybersecurity culture is possible by focusing on the human aspects of cybersecurity as much as the technical aspects. Leadership knowledge, skills and abilities, developing cybersecurity awareness throughout the organization, effective communication and acceptance of this transformation as a continuous learning experience are listed among the main factors affecting the cybersecurity culture.
