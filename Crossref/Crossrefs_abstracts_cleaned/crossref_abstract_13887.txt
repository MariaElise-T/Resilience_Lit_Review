Background
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing guidelines greatly impacted the quality of life (QoL) of nursing faculty.


Purpose
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of QoL, resilience, and associated factors among nursing faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Methods
In April 2020, a cross-sectional, anonymous survey was conducted with nursing faculty in a public university in rural Appalachia (n = 52). Instruments included QoL, resilience scales, work-related, and demographic variables. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze data. A content analysis was used to analyze an open-ended question.


Results
Resilience was the strongest variable to predict each of the QoL domains. Nursing faculty who reported better QoL were those who were able to adapt to changes and challenges mandated during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Conclusions
Evidence-based programs to build resilience and improve nursing faculty working conditions and their QoL are needed.
