Innovation in governance and services should be the target of the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Monitoring processes, impacts, and outcomes requires a system of new indicators that are practical to collect. Secondary data sources, their availability, and their information potential should be evaluated, and primary sources should be implemented to supplement traditional disease surveillance. This work highlights the most relevant aspects for bridging the mismatching between complex community needs and current health/social supply and how those aspects could be faced. As a result, we propose a structured multi-phases process for setting the design and functionalities of a cooperative information system, built on the integration between secondary and primary data for informing policies about chronic low back pain (CLBP), a widely recognized determinant of disability and significant economic burden. In particular, we propose the Dress-KINESIS, a tool for improving community capacity development and participation that allows one to freely collect big health and social data and link it to existing secondary data. The system also may be able to monitor how the resources are distributed across different care sectors and suggest how to improve efficiency based on the patientâ€™s CLBP risk stratification. Moreover, it is potentially customizable in other fields of health.
