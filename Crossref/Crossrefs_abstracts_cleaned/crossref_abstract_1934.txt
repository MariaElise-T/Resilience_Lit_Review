The dynamic mechanical properties of rubberlike materials and plastics are reviewed briefly. The dynamic properties that would make a rubberlike material ideally suited for use as a resilient isolator are described. It is shown that the properties of a mechanical combination of low- and high-damping rubbers can approach these ideal properties more closely than the properties of either of the constituent rubbers. Consideration is given to wave effects that occur in resilient isolators at high frequencies. Results of calculations that describe the vibration of an internally damped Timoshenko beam are presented. In these calculations, damping is associated with both the bending and the shear strain of the beam material. The individual contributions of the bending and shear components of damping are made apparent. The vibration of internally damped Bernoulli-Euler beams is also considered. The beams are driven by two or three forces positioned such that the net force transmitted to the beam terminations is attenuated through significant ranges of frequency. The influence of secondary forces upon the driving-point impedance presented to a primary force at other locations on the beams is also discussed. [Work sponsored by U. S. Bureau of Weapons, U. S.
