The persistent inequalities in urban public education in the U. S. that
                        have left far too many Black and Hispanic male students behind with respect
                        to academic skill development, high school graduation, and college success
                        have led Catholic groups to provide alternative secondary school models to
                        advance the academic and career success of urban students. One of these
                        initiatives is the NativityMiguel model school, the first of which opened in
                        New York City in 1971. The present study examines the lived experience, with
                        respect to benefits of this education on the subsequent academic and career
                        successes, of male graduates of two of these schools, one for African
                        American, or Black, students and one for Mexican American students in
                        different parts of the country. Analyses of interviews with 37 graduates
                        showed that they benefitted from the schools’ approach to academic skill
                        development and the building of resilience, leadership, and a commitment to
                        service in the context of a community that continued to support the
                        development of resilience after middle school graduation. Differences in
                        aspects of the two programs are examined along with the implications for
                        making use of the schools’ initiatives on a larger scale.
