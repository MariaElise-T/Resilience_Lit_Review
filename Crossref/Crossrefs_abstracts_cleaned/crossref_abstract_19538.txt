Parkia biglobosa faces several constraints like ageing population, mortality and poor natural regeneration. To contribute to the domestication of the species and improve its resilience to drought, a study was conducted in southern Mali. Studied factors were the Provenance (North Sudanian “NS”, South Sudanian “SS”, North Guinean “NG) and Soil Moisture Conservation Technique “SMCT” (Half-moons made with Rubble Stones “H-M R”, Half-moons made with Ground “H-M G” and the Control). The average survival rate was 50% and the highest mean survival rate (78%) was observed at Diou 24 months after planting. For provenance, survival rate varied from 47% (NS and SS) to 58 % (NG) at Somasso, 18% (NG) to 28% (NS) at Zanzoni and 73% (NG) to 83% (NS) at Diou. For SMCT, survival rate ranged from 48% (H-M G and Control) to 56% (H-M R) at Somasso, 17% (Control) to 28% (H-M G) at Zanzoni and 76% (H-M G) to 82% (H-M R) at Diou. The mean height was 37 cm, 24 months planting. The highest mean height (42 cm) was observed at Somasso. A significant interaction Provenance*SMCT was observed at Zanzoni. The highest mean height (72 cm) was observed in the combination (SS*H-M G). The result of the study revealed that the use of SMCT particularly half-moon made with rubble stones could improve the resilience of P. biglobosa and renew the agroforestry parklands. This allows maintaining the biodiversity of parklands in the sudanian and sudano-guinean zones.
