The sustainable design and construction of highways is indispensable for the economic growth and progress of any region. Highway pavements are one of the core transportation infrastructures that require energy efficient materials with durability and an optimized lifecycle. Recent research has proven that warm-mix asphalt pavements prepared with renewable bio-binders are less susceptible to distresses. This study aims to investigate the resilience characteristics (load time, deformation time) of soybean oil modified and unmodified warm-mix asphalts. Aggregates, asphalt binders and asphalt mixes were characterized in accordance with the Superpave Mix Design Criteria. The resilient modulus tests were performed as per ASTM D7369. The test results indicated that the soybean-modified warm asphalt mix samples showed a 20% to 32% reduction in load-carrying capacity than unmodified warm asphalt mixes. The values of the horizontal and vertical recoverable deformations observed in the soybean-modified mixes were found to be 3% to 7% more than in the unmodified mixes. A slight variability (up to 7%) was also observed in the time-response spectra, i.e., peak load, unload and rest periods, in the soybean-modified mixes compared with the unmodified mixes. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a significant trend between the resilient modulus test parameters for the soybean-modified warm asphalt mixes, i.e., load deformation, load time and deformation time. Soybean oil showed sustainable behavior as a bio-binder, particularly in the deformation-time response for the warm asphalt mixes. However, the effect of soybean in terms of the reduction of the load-carrying capacity from a sustainability perspective needs to be investigated.
