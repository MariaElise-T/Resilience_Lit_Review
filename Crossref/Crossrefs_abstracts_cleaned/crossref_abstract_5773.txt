AbstractDue to the traumatic events they may have experienced, refugee youth are vulnerable to mental health problems. Social Circus is a psycho-social intervention that aims to enhance resilience by promoting self-esteem, interpersonal trust and social support through classes in circus arts. To explore these effects on refugee youth, a qualitative study was conducted in south-east Turkey. Semi-structured interviews and participative observations revealed that circus classes offered participants structure and a new purpose in life. Participating youth became more active, while impulsive behaviour decreased. Experiencing success through visible progress and holding the positively valued position of a circus artist seemed to contribute to the childrenâ€™s self-esteem. In addition, the mental and physical support received during circus classes could increase interpersonal trust. By creating opportunities for social interaction and building relationships, Social Circus may also promote social support. This study provides preliminary evidence that Social Circus may enhance resilience in refugee youth.
