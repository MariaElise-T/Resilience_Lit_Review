Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of a community-based resilience intervention for Filipino displaced survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan.


Design/methodology/approach
The researchers used a quasi-experimental and mixed-method design comparing a treatment group with a control group across three time periods: before, immediately after, and six months after the intervention.


Findings
Results showed significant improvements in survivorsâ€™ anxiety scores and resilience scores compared to those who did not undergo the program. However, although there was an increase in adaptive coping of participants immediately after the program, there was a reduction in adaptive coping behaviors for all groups six months after the program. Focus group discussions revealed this might be due to significant environmental challenges among displaced survivors.


Research limitations/implications
A limitation of the study was the lack of randomization and a small sample size due to attrition.


Practical implications
The study highlights the positive effects of culturally adapted group interventions.


Social implications
The results suggest the importance of a systemic approach to enabling the recovery of displaced survivors in developing countries.


Originality/value
This study provides evidence for a resilience intervention developed in a low-middle income country in Southeast Asia.
