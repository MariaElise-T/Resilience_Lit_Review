This paper is a conceptual study that introduces the role of collaborative regulation into the supply chain resilience debate. The manufacturing supply chain ofhalalpharmaceuticals in Malaysia forms the context of the paper. In this paper, a critical review of previous studies on supply chain resilience, joint working relationships between supply chain actors, and collaborative involvement of regulatory authorities in supply chain relationships was carried out. Collaborative regulation for improved supply chain resilience is the coordinated, consistent, and strategic activities that includes: effective, as well as regular coordination and interactions; knowledge and information sharing, verification, and periodical monitoring, as well as enforcement of collaborative approaches to policy and regulatory control mechanisms via coercive force of isomorphism. The arguments put forward, contribute to improving knowledge, by specifying the conditions in which supply chain resilience is stronger in highly regulated contexts. This is an aspect that is ill reflected in the supply chain management literature.
