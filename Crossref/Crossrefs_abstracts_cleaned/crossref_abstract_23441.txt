Since China declared that the post-epidemic era would begin in April 2020, the prevention and control of epidemics have become routine. The capacity of cities to respond to future public health emergencies will be enhanced if the resilience of cities is accurately measured and an emphasis is placed on improving resilience levels. Under the 4R framework, this study quantifies and analyzes the level of resilience of the cities in Jiangsu Province from both subjective and objective perspectives. By selecting explanatory variables and developing a GWR model, the spatial distribution characteristics of the quantified scores of resilience and the spatial characteristics of the influencing factors are analyzed. The results indicate that cities in southern Jiangsu should invest more in economic development and medical resources in the post-epidemic period. Northern Jiangsu should prioritize boosting the health and social work sectorâ€™s gross domestic product. Coastal cities must enhance their capacity for innocuous waste treatment.
