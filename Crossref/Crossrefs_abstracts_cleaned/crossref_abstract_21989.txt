Abstract. Climate resilience is an emerging issue at contaminated sites and hazardous
waste sites, since projected climate shifts (e.g., increased/decreased
precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., flooding, drought) could affect
ongoing remediation or closure strategies. In this study, we develop a
reactive transport model (Amanzi) for radionuclides (uranium, tritium, and
others) and evaluate how different scenarios under climate change will
influence the contaminant plume conditions and groundwater well
concentrations. We demonstrate our approach using a two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model for the Savannah River Site F-Area, including mineral reaction and sorption processes. Different recharge scenarios are considered
by perturbing the infiltration rate from the base case as well as considering cap-failure and climate projection scenarios. We also evaluate the uranium and nitrate concentration ratios between scenarios and the base
case to isolate the sorption effects with changing recharge rates. The
modeling results indicate that the competing effects of dilution and
remobilization significantly influence pH, thus changing the sorption of
uranium. At the maximum concentration on the breakthrough curve, higher
aqueous uranium concentration implies that sorption is reduced with lower pH
due to remobilization. To better evaluate the climate change impacts in the
future, we develop the workflow to include the downscaled CMIP5 (Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project) climate projection data in the reactive
transport model and evaluate how residual contamination evolves through 2100 under four climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
scenarios. The integration of climate modeling data and hydrogeochemistry models enables us to quantify the climate change impacts, assess which
impacts need to be planned for, and therefore assist climate resiliency
efforts and help guide site management.
