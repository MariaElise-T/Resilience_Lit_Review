Enhancing urban climate resilience and innovating urban risk governance model are of great significance to promote the security development of cities. This paper discusses urban disaster risk prevention and mitigation strategies from the perspective of climate resilience. The urban climate resilience index system is constructed through text mining. The entropy weight TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method and obstacle degree model are used to measure the climate resilience index and identify the main obstacle factors that affect the improvement of urban climate resilience. This provides a quantitative representation method for the analysis of urban climate resilience and clarifies the contribution of climate resilience to urban disaster risk prevention and mitigation, as well as the key and difficult points of urban disaster risk prevention and mitigation. Therefore, based on the quantitative analysis of climate resilience, this paper puts forward disaster risk prevention and mitigation strategies from five aspects: collaborative governance, urban planning, early warning system, scientific and technological empowerment, and disaster education. It is expected to provide a reference for the urban system to maintain green, low-carbon, and high-quality development under climate change.
