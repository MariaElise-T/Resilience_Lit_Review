AbstractData repositories using legacy data are needed to minimize research redundancy, enable knowledge synthesis, and optimize productivity and resiliency of agricultural systems. However, a framework is needed to develop an online searchable database to identify optimum systems for sustainable agricultural intensification and diversification, particularly for forages. Therefore, this paper outlines the development of a community‐driven forage database (Forage Data Hub) using legacy datasets encompassing multiple temporal and spatial scales and species to analyze system functionality and resiliency. Specific steps outlined included (1) developing minimum and preferred data requirements; (2) data standardization, structuring, and compilation; (3) creating a data thesaurus, data shapes, and data model; and (4) creating a web‐based system interface to facilitate database access. We demonstrate utility of curating these diverse datasets by quantifying forage system resiliency during extreme weather occurrences (relationship between standardized yields and yields during years receiving 25th percentile of the 30‐year normal precipitation) for three systems (monocrop annual, monocrop perennial, and mixed perennial) spanning 52,997 data entries (108 unique locations and 51 years). Overall, during low‐precipitation years, monocrop annual systems achieved 67% of their expected yield, while monocrop perennial systems achieved 93% and mixed perennial systems achieved 112% of potential yields. Therefore, diverse perennial systems were more resilient to climate‐related stresses compared to annual forage systems. Development of the US Forage Data Hub underscores the benefits of community‐driven data sharing and curation for a given commodity to provide system‐level sustainability assessments for identifying practices that promote ecological intensification and resiliency to climatic stochasticity.
