In the article, we researched the psychological resilience of the volunteers of the call center of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and National Informational Burau, enabling them to adapt quickly to extreme situations. A higher level of resilience in volunteers is explained by the essence of the volunteering that provides an opportunity to perceive an extreme situation, feel it, make decisions about participation and help (basic anthropological capacities), control emotions, positively reassess the situation, plan solutions, receive community support (resilient coping strategies), to balance between acceptance of conditions and the need to change something despite fear (space) due to the ability not to subjectively perceive threats to oneself in any situations (personal anxiety), as well as to understand why all this is and how personal experience is enriched (life philosophy). A recommendation is developed regarding expanding the volunteer network and its organization, simplifying access to it during extreme situations, and involvement of broader segments of the population, which will increase the psychological resilience of volunteers and society in general during martial law in Ukraine.
