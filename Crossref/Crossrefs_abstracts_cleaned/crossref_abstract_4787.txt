Nurse managers are often exposed to workplace stressors, thus it becomes necessary to enhance their resilience which will enable them to withstand workplace adversity. The purpose of the current study was to develop strategies that can enhance the resilience of nurse managers. A purposive sample of 49 nurse managers working in the general wards of 11 public hospitals in Botswana was undertaken. The study was done in two phases. Phase 1 of the study entailed the empirical phase that followed a concurrent mixed methods research (MMR) design, which included both quantitative and qualitative components in a single study at the same time. In Phase 2, the findings from the empirical phase, as well as the theoretical data, were utilised to develop a conceptual framework and strategies to enhance the resilience of nurse managers. The Kumpfer resilience model was used to guide the development of the conceptual framework, and a logic model further assisted with the development of strategies. The study identified the following main strategies that can enhance the resilience of nurse managers, namely: leadership development; building support systems; life skills development; and resource availability. The strategies should be utilised by nurse managers and senior management to enhance the resilience of nurse managers in order to facilitate the delivery of quality nursing services and patient care.
