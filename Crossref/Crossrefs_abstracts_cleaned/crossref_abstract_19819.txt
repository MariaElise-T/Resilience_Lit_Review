Objectives: Native Americans have higher rates of mental health symptoms and chronic disease compared to the general population, partly due to historical loss (eg, land, language, culture). Few studies have examined strength-based characteristics that enable Native populations
 to cope with loss and reduce loss-related emotional symptoms (eg, anxiety, anger). Methods: We recruited 81 participants (mean age 47.9 years; 61% female) in a midwestern Anishinaabe community using convenience sampling. Participants completed questionnaires assessing historical loss,
 loss-related emotional symptoms, psychological resilience, and maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies. Hierarchical regression analyses examined associations of historical loss, psychological resilience, and coping strategies with loss-related emotional symptoms after controlling for demographics.
 Results: Historical loss ( β = .56, p < .001) and maladaptive coping strategies ( β = .23, p < .05) were positively associated with loss-related symptoms among Anishinaabe community members; psychological resilience was inversely associated with loss-related symptoms
 ( β = -.21, p < .05). Adaptive coping strategies ( β = .02, p > .05) were not associated with loss-related symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that historical loss is associated with loss-related emotional symptoms in the Anishinaabe population. Public health programs
 that foster psychological resilience and reduce maladaptive coping strategies are needed to address these loss-related symptoms.
