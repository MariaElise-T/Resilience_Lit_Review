AbstractMulti‐interface multi‐channel can be used to reduce the channel interference and improve the network capacity for multi‐hop wireless ad‐hoc networks, but using multi‐channel will impact the network connectivity, which is an important quality of service factor in VANET. The basic multi‐channel assignment scheme in our paper keeps the network connectivity resilient to the mobility. On the basis of this method, we design a dynamic channel assignment algorithm that can dynamically switch the channels to the less busy ones by monitoring the channel usages. In order to survive the highly mobile scenarios in VANET, the algorithm is designed in a fully distributed way with low overhead. Simulations show that our method can notably improve the throughput of VANETs. And the performance keeps steady with various network configurations. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
