AbstractArtificial electronic skin (E‐skin), a class of promising materials mimicking the physical‐chemical and sensory performance of the human skin, has gained extensive interest in the field of human health‐monitoring and robotic skins. However, developing E‐skin simultaneously achieving high resilience, hysteresis‐free, and absent external power is always a formidable challenge. Herein, a liquid‐free eutectic gel‐based self‐powered E‐skin with high resilience, fatigue resistance, and conductivity is prepared by introducing hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) into metal salt‐based deep eutectic solvents (MDES). The unique structural design of cellulose‐anchored permanent entangled poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) chain, in combination with rapid broken/reconstruction of the dense dynamic sacrificial bonds, realizes the fabrication of high‐elastic E‐skin with negligible hysteresis. This further demonstrates the promising practical application of the cellulose‐based eutectogel with high transmittance (92%), high conductivity (36.6 mS m−1), and high resilience (98.1%), and excellent environment stability in robust triboelectric nanogenerator for energy harvesting and high resilience, self‐powered E‐skin for human health‐caring and human‐machine interaction.
