Objective: This study asked selected mature individuals with Moebius syndrome to discuss the sources of strength and resiliency that allowed them to achieve professional and personal success. Design: Adults with Moebius syndrome were selected in a nonrandom manner based primarily on their affiliation with the Moebius Syndrome Foundation. Following a letter from the author describing the objective, the subjects were interviewed by telephone and were encouraged to respond at length. Participants: Eighteen adults (aged 29 to 70 years) responded. All were or had been gainfully employed in a variety of professional or vocational positions. Results: The respondents reported the following as major sources of resiliency and success: family support, faith, humor, sense of self, special skills, determination, and networking. Conclusions: The recognition and reinforcement of strengths and resiliences in younger patients may help maximize their professional and personal success as adults.
