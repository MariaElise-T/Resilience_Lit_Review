PurposeUsing a recent television series as a start point, this paper aims to explore risk management and the impact of serious offending on individuals and communities.Design/methodology/approachConcepts like mad, bad, good, or evil are examined in the context of horrific social events and links to recent developments in government strategy aiming to strengthen and protect community resilience.FindingsIt is shown how the nature of society and modern lifestyles can influence the resilience levels and the likelihood of individuals from all walks of life contributing towards community resilience.Social implicationsCommunity resilience is positioned with the idea that society should not only support direct victims of horrific events, but also those indirectly affected in the same local community.Originality/valueThe paper argues that the notion of community resilience provides a useful framework for thinking about how, in a risk‚Äêaverse society, community participation to promote wellbeing within particular neighbourhoods might be facilitated.
