Introduction. Differences between the tooth and implant response to load can
   lead to many biological and technical implications in the conditions of
   occlusal forces. Objective. The objective of this study was to analyze load
   distribution in tooth/implant-supported fixed partial dentures with the use
   of resilient TSA (Titan Shock Absorber, BoneCare GmbH, Augsburg, Germany)
   abutment and conventional non-resilient abutment using finite element method.
   Methods. This study presents two basic 3D models. For one model a standard
   non-resilient abutment is used, and on the implant of the second model a
   resilient TSA abutment is applied. The virtual model contains drawn contours
   of tooth, mucous membranes, implant, cortical bones and spongiosa, abutment
   and suprastructure. The experiment used 500 N of vertical force, applied in
   three different cases of axial load. Calculations of von Mises equivalent
   stresses of the tooth root and periodontium, implants and peri-implant tissue
   were made. Results. For the model to which a non-resilient abutment is
   applied, maximum stress values in all three cases are observed in the
   cortical part of the bone (maximum stress value of 49.7 MPa). Measurements of
   stress and deformation in the bone tissue in the model with application of
   the resilient TSA abutment demonstrated similar distribution; however, these
   values are many times lower than in the model with non-resilient TSA abutment
   (maximum stress value of 28.9 MPa). Conclusion. Application of the resilient
   TSA abutment results in more equal distribution of stress and deformations in
   the bone tissue under vertical forces. These values are many times lower than
   in the model with the non-resilient abutment.
