Where the welfare state has failed, can a new civic economy succeed? Constantin Petcou and Doina Petrescu co‐founded atelier d'architecture autogérée to explore participatory urbanism as an answer to today's environmental and economic challenges. One result is R‐Urban, a framework centred around ‘civic hubs’ that allows communities to enhance their resilience through a range of interconnected initiatives. Implemented in neighbourhoods in the Paris area and London, it can be adapted to any location and scaled up to have an impact on a regional level and beyond.
