Reports follow-up study of 181 young highly stressed urban children, classified as

stress-resilient (SR) and stress-affected (SA) 1½–2 years earlier. At follow-up

(T2), children were retested on five initial (T1) test measures:

self-rated adjustment, perceived competence, social problem solving, realistic control

attributions, and empathy; parents and teachers did new child adjustment ratings, and parents

participated in a phone interview focusing on the T1–T2

interval. Child test and adjustment measures and parent interview responses at T2

sensitively differentiated children classified as SR and SA at T1. Test and

interview variables used at T1 and T2 correlated moderately across

time periods. At T2, four child test indicators (i.e., rule conformity, global

self-worth, social problem solving, and realistic control attributions) and four parent interview

variables (positive future expectations for the child, absence of predelinquency indicators, good

parent mental health in the past year, and adaptive parent coping strategies) sensitively

differentiated children classified as SR and SA at T1. No relationship was found

between family stress experienced in the T1–T2 interval

and changes in children's adjustment during that period.
