Abstract
Date Presented 04/22/2023
Stress, sleep, and sensory processing heavily influence a personâ€™s occupational performance and occupational roles. OTs should understand the influence of resilience on these factors in order to offer appropriate caregiver support for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). OT support will benefit parents, their children, families, and communities because they can cope better with everyday stressors.
