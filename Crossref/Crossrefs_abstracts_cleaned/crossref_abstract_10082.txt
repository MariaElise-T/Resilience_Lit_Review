Infrastructures such as transportation systems, power grids, communication networks, water resources, health delivery systems, and financial networks/institutions are vital to the safety, security and the well-being of the society. Reliable performance and protection of such systems is of paramount importance. Critical infrastructure systems, when viewed as complex interacting networks, present many interesting technical challenges to the modeling, analysis and simulation community. In this paper, we review the generic structure of such systems from the perspective of robust design and resilient behavior.
