AbstractChallenges of modern living such as burden of disease, a global COVID-19 pandemic and workplace stress leading to anxiety and depression raise the importance of psychological resilience. Psychological interventions should increase trait resilience that involves reinforcing state resilience and requires a clear distinction between state and trait aspects of the construct. Generalizability theory is the appropriate method increasingly used to distinguish between state and trait and to establish reliability of psychological assessment. G-theory was applied to examine five major resilience scales completed at 3 time-points by the sample (n = 94) that possess adequate statistical power for such analyses. All five resilience scales demonstrated strong reliability and generalizability of scores across occasions and sample population as expected for a valid trait measure (G > 0.90). However, eight state aspects of resilience were identified from all five resilience scales including adaptation to change; perseverance; self-confidence while facing adversity; self-efficacy; trust in instincts; ability to follow plans; non-reactivity; and ability to plan. State aspects of resilience appear to show more variability and, pending further research, could potentially be a target for resilience-building interventions. All five measures of resilience are useful to assess long-lasting changes in resilience. Development of a state resilience scale is warranted.
