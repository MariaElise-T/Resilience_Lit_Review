All human beings experience a transitional stage from puberty to adulthood that involves physical, psychological and cognitive changes (Berk,2013). Thus adolescents have to cope with several stressful life changing situations which can disrupt their psychological well-being. This study intends to find out if resilience and spirituality could be correlates of psychological well-being of a sample of 64 adolescents. The tools used included Brief Resilience Scale by B.W Smith et al. (2008), Scales of Psychological Well-being by C.D Ryff et al. (1999) and Spiritual Health Inventory by Beach & Chappel (1992).   The obtained results show that, there is a significant positive relationship between resilience and spirituality, and resilience and psychological well-being. It also shows the significance of gender difference in resilience. Thus, the results imply that an effort should be made at a very young age to enhance resilience, so that people will experience a better psychological well-being.
