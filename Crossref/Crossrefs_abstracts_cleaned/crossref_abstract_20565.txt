Here we performed a narrative review highlighting the effect of brain/cognitive reserve and natural/synthetic antioxidants in exerting a neuroprotective effect against cognitive deterioration during physiological and pathological aging. Particularly, we discussed pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, brain and cognitive reserve as means of resilience towards deterioration, and evidence from the literature about antioxidants’ role in sustaining cognitive functioning in the preclinical phase of dementia. During aging, the effects of disease-related brain changes upon cognition are reduced in individuals with higher cognitive reserve, which might lose its potential with emerging cognitive symptoms in the transitional phase over the continuum normal aging-dementia (i.e., Mild Cognitive Impairment). Starting from this assumption, MCI should represent a potential target of intervention in which antioxidants effects may contribute—in part—to counteract a more severe brain deterioration (alongside to cognitive stimulation) causing a rightward shift in the trajectory of cognitive decline, leading patients to cross the threshold for clinical dementia later.
