This study aimed to investigate the moderating effects of resilience and support of coworkers on the relationship between violence experience and job satisfaction of psychiatric nurses. Data from 152 psychiatric nurses working in six psychiatric hospitals and one university hospital mental ward in Busan and Gyeongnam were analyzed. The results of this study are as follows. First, verbal violence, physical threats, or physical violence were the most frequently experienced by nurses. Second, violence experience was more common in 20-something nurses than 40-something nurses. Third, nurses with less than 5 years of experience were more likely to experience physical violence than nurses with more than 10 years of experience. Fourth, the moderating effect was not significant for resilience but significant for co-worker support. Therefore, medical institutions should develop and implement a co-worker support program as a strategy to improve job satisfaction among psychiatric nurses who have experienced violence.
