The main purpose of this study is to clarify the difference in disaster resilience between survivors and victims’ families by analyzing the language used in popular literature on disaster cases. The results showed that there were differences in emotions, behaviors, attitudes, role perceptions, etc., between survivors and victims’ families in dealing with a disaster. In particular, survivors remember and think about the situation that occurred at the time of the disaster, which creates resilience to the incident, while victims’ families attempt to establish resilience to the incident by investigating the facts and government countermeasures. While survivors were focused on building their own resilience, victims’ families were more focused on improving government countermeasures to prevent such accidents from recurring. This can be considered as social or national resilience. Based on this comparative analysis, it is necessary to prepare various theoretical foundations for disaster preparedness and resilience, while further elaborating the theory.
