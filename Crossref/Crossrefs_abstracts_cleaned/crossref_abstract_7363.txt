Asymmetric warfare is a game of nerves and thoughts with least vigorous participation for large anticipated losses by creating partial or permanent paraplegia. Strategic analysis of asymmetric warfare since the World War I till the post-cold-war era exposits that the courage makes nations win the battle of warriors to battle of comrades. Despite preparations, asymmetric warfare has been difficult to fight due to uncertainty of circumstances and lethality of weapons. Thoughts before action may be the best-assumed strategy to mix Regional Security Complex Theory (RSCT) and Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop to develop the Paraplegic Resilience Policy Plan (PRPP) to win asymmetric warfare. PRPP may serve to control and halt the ongoing wave of terrorism, guerrilla warfare and insurgencies. PRPP, along with a strategic work plan, is based on psychometric analysis to deal with any possible war condition and tactic to save millions of innocent lives. However, self-imposed epistemic dilemmas result in regret[s] that become the course of action. This is a descriptive study of war conditions with generic application of probability tests to find the best possible options and conditions to develop PRPP for any adverse condition possible. Innovation in technology begets modernisation in strategy to serve as a rheostat approach to deal with asymmetric warfare.
