Education plays a key role in enhancing the emotional skills of students to create a more cooperative, empathetic society. Therefore, emotional intelligence plays a vital role in changing human behaviours towards pro-social activities and promoting resilience of society. In this highly competitive education system maintaining ethical and emotional obligation towards colleagues is significant for others to survive the challenging periods in their lives and establishing a virtuous practice in the future. Also, how students can be assisted with this in view, is questionable, since evidence in this regard is lacking. Thus, this study was conducted to explore how emotional intelligence influences undergraduatesâ€™ pro-social behaviour during the undergraduate period for promoting the resilience of society. This study employed a quantitative deductive research approach. Using a self-administered questionnaire, 175 responses of Management undergraduates, the University of Ruhuna, were gathered by employing the convenient sampling technique. Study results revealed that emotional perception, emotional understanding, emotional use, and emotional management have a positive influence on the pro-social behaviour of Management undergraduates for promoting resilience of society. Study provides vital implications to the practitioners and researchers and for future studies suggested to use larger sample size to get more clear insights regarding study phenomenon.
