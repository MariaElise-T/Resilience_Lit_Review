Existing research suggests that mindfulness cultivates positive affect while reducing negative affect, and facilitates increases in resilience. More research is needed to examine the complex mechanisms by which emotional affect likely translates mindfulness into increased states of resilience in undergraduates. We hypothesised that the relationship between mindfulness and resilience in Maltese undergraduates is mediated by both positive and negative affect. Using a cross-sectional survey design and quantitative methodology based on mediation analysis, a questionnaire comprising the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and Brief Resilience Scale was circulated among 226 Maltese undergraduates. The results support previous research indicating significant relationships between mindfulness and both forms of emotional affect, as well as increased resilience. A path analysis revealed full mediation of the interaction between mindfulness and resilience by affective well-being. The indirect pathways through positive and negative affect to resilience, cumulatively accounted for a majority of the explanatory power attributable to mindfulness alone. Finally, an argument is presented in favour of mindfulness as a more formalised intervention within higher education settings, to support broader psychological wellness outcomes among Maltese undergraduates.
