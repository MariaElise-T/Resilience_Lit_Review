This work investigates a model design for lightweight, architected material inclusions that cultivate significant impact energy dissipation in structures. The inclusions are sustained near a critical point where damping is theoretically increased without bound. Using the principle, a material architecture and constraint mechanism are studied that exemplify the theory. Guided by a computational model and analysis, numerous specimens are fabricated and experimentation verifies that engineered material inclusions constrained nearer to critical points most effectively suppress structural dynamics following impact, minimize transmitted impulsive force, and better promote structural integrity. The concepts articulated here may find broad application for reusable, resilient protective structures.
