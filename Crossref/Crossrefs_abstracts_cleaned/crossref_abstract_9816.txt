It is generally thought that job-related diversity positively affects performance, whereas, bio-demographic diversity negatively affects performance. But various studies show controversial results, therefore, due to this inconsistency, we need to see the relationship between work-related diversity and its impact on various other variables like leader resilience and also test different moderators like diversity climate, etc. to see if the relationship strengthens or weakens. This study analyzed the impact of bio-demographic (gender and age) and job-related (functional) diversity on leader resilience, and whether diversity climate moderators this relationship or not. Using data from different organizational settings of Pakistan, we found that gender, age, and functional diversity have a positive relationship with leader resilience, on the other hand, diversity climate does not affect leader resilience.
