Background: The word “resilience” has been trending since recent devastating natural disasters and the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. This study sought to uncover how Japanese pharmacists perceive and define resiliency and quantify their resilient behaviours for the purpose of enhancing pharmacy education.   
Methods: A four-part, online questionnaire that included the 10 Factor Resilient Behavior Scale (F10RBS) was sent to pharmacists around Japan.    
Results: Pharmacists defined resilience as “bouncing back” and “a positive adaptation after trauma”. An exploratory factor analysis of the resilience-enhancing behaviours led to three factors: personal health and well-being, altruism, and a positive outlook.    
Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that resilience is strengthened through experience and previously established behaviours and skills. This understanding of resilient behaviours can be integrated into pharmacy education by encouraging university students to maintain a healthy lifestyle and make choices that will nurture resilience before experiencing a traumatic event or the stress of professional work.
