 Research within civil engineering is focusing on newer ideas and philosophies such as sustainability and resiliency (S&R). This is evident in the development of frameworks for assessing the sustainability or the resiliency of civil infrastructures. Several frameworks have been developed by researchers to quantify the S&R of civil infrastructures. It is evident that the S&R are not mutually exclusive, and it is important to assess these aspects at the same time and that frameworks are able to accommodate simultaneous assessments. While there are other frameworks that follow a unified approach to S&R assessments, they do not account for the risk of the hazard as part of the framework. In the proposed framework, an attempt was made to include the risk of the hazard as part of the assessment to gain a realistic perspective of the hazard impact. This paper presents explicit steps to use the framework, along with an example of using the framework in assessing an earthen dam subjected to two types of hazards, earthquakes and floods. The novel aspects of this framework revolve around the simplicity and flexibility of the framework. Major input parameters are user-defined, which allows for a wide range of variables to be considered when determining the overall quality of the infrastructure.
