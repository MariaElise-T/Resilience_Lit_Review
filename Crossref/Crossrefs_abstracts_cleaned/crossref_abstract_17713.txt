There is substantial evidence confirming that children who begin school with strong developmental skills tend to maintain positive academic trajectories across the elementary school years. Much less is known about children who begin school with poorer developmental competencies yet go on to achieve academically on par with, or above, their initially more competent peers, demonstrating academic resilience. This study used a large population dataset, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 2,118) to identify children who demonstrated academic resilience between school entry and third grade, and the child, parenting, and school characteristics associated with this resilience. Findings show that two in five children who were initially identified as academically vulnerable on a school entry measure of language and cognitive skills were classified as academically resilient by Grade 3. In multivariate analysis, higher attentional regulation and receptive vocabulary skills were key factors associated with academic resilience in reading and numeracy, along with paternal consistency (for reading resilience) and fewer sleep problems (for numeracy resilience). Bivariate relations (ANOVAs) showed that resilient children, when compared to children who remained vulnerable, also showed fewer peer problems, fewer behavioral sleep problems, higher levels of parenting consistency and lower levels of parenting anger by mothers and fathers, higher levels of parental engagement in childrenâ€™s school, and higher levels of teacher self-efficacy. Supporting resilient pathways for children who are identified as vulnerable at school entry should include a particular focus on vocabulary development and attentional regulation, along with social skills and peer relationships, school-based parental engagement, and positive parenting support.
