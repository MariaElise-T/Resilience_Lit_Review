Objective:
We compare the unit costs of providing Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) interventions to adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) reached across two sites, an urban (Nyalenda A Ward) and peri-urban (Kolwa East Ward) setting, in Kisumu County of Kenya.


Design:
Micro-costing, using the average cost concept during project initiation and early implementation.


Methods:
Adopting the implementer's (provider's) perspective, we computed and classified costs in the following categories for each sub-implementing partner: medical and professional staff, administrative and support staff, materials and supplies, building space and utilities, equipment, establishment, and miscellaneous. These costs were summed across sub-implementing partners in a site to obtain the site-level total costs. These are then divided by the total number of AGYW reached in each site to obtain the unit costs. Data were collected from July to September 2017.


Results:
The unit costs in the peri-urban area were about 1.9 times of those in the urban area. It cost about US$67 [or 170 International Dollars] to deliver the DREAMS intervention package to each AGYW reached in the urban area as compared with approximately US$129 (or 327 International Dollars) in the peri-urban area.


Conclusion:
First, it was generally more expensive to deliver DREAMS interventions in the peri-urban setting as compared with the urban setting. Second, the difference in unit costs was mainly driven by the building space and utilities. Strategies to lower intervention costs are needed in the peri-urban setting, such as using existing infrastructure (either governmental or nongovernmental) or other innovative ways to deliver the services.
