Background: Nursing preceptor are under the pressure of clinical and teaching work. The impact of pressure on physical and mental health includes depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and even mental exhaustion and exhaustion. If they fail to get relief from work, it will cause negative emotions, and will be physically and mentally exhausted for a long time.Aims: To understand the workplace stress, sleep, and resilience of nursing preceptor.Methods: The study used a cross-sectional study design. The enrollment setting was the Nursing Department of a teaching hospital. A total of 35 nursing preceptors.Results: A total of 54.29% of situational anxiety were moderate, 80.0% of trait anxiety was moderate, 57.1% had difficulty falling asleep, 65.7% were unable to maintain a long sleep, and 71.4% had trouble waking up too early, and 91.4% expressed dissatisfaction with sleep. 80.0% have sleep disturbance, and the resilience is low (below 121 points), accounting for 42.8%. Resilience and situational anxiety (p=.003), trait anxiety (p=.001), sleep disturbance (p<.001), physiological stimulation of sleep physical and mental state (p=.003), and cognitive stimulation of sleep physical and mental state (p< .001) are all negative correlations. Trait anxiety is positively correlated with sleep disorders (p<.001).Conclusion: The score of resilience is low, and the various distress states are higher; the higher the distress states, the higher the sleep disturbance. Therefore, for the stress and sleep problems of clinical nursing instructors, caring services should be provided in the future, or through group activities that provide resilience enhance face stress, and reduce sleep disturbance.Recommendations: Clinics can routinely arrange resilience groups to help nurses increase their ability to face stress and improve their quality of life.
