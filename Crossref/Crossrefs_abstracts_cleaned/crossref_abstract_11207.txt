The present paper probes the interplay between digital education, studentsâ€™ mental resilience, and their emotional well-being within the context of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In particular, the paper places a focal point on addressing mental health issues among students and assesses the impact of the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020 in creating an educational atmosphere and environment facilitative to the cognitive growth and well-being of students. It is evident that the widespread circulation of technology among students of HEIs has detrimental effects on their mental resilience and emotional well-being. Excessive digital screen time leads to deteriorated mental health, including increased anxiety, depression, compulsive behaviours etc., intensified by nomophobia (no mobile phobia). Again, information overload in the digital age hampers decision-making ability and deepens anxiety among students. The deleterious effects of cyberbullying and phubbing on social skills, well-being, interaction and relationships capture the essence for educators, researchers and policymakers to address these concerns without much delay. Nevertheless, NEP 2020 already prioritizes both academic excellence and the mental health of students of HEIs through facilitating counselling services, a flexible curriculum, diverse extracurricular activities etc. The policy aims to reduce anxiety and stress by shifting away focus from rote memorization, high-stakes assessments and a rigid academic atmosphere while cultivating a vibrant campus life. It also recognizes the unique needs of vulnerable student populations, emphasizing targeted support for their academic success and mental well-being. While NEP 2020 acknowledges these concerns, it may fall short of fully addressing these complex mental health challenges, necessitating a more adaptable, holistic approach.
