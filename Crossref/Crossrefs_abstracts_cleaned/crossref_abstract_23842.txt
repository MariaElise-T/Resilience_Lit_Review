To a certain degree, the resilience of the transportation system expresses the safety of the transportation system, because it reflects the ability of the system to maintain its function in the face of disturbance events. In the current research, the assessment of the resilience of urban mobility is attractive and challenging. Apart from this, the concept of green mobility has been popular in recent years. As a representative way of shared mobility, the implementation of ridesharing will affect the level of urban mobility resilience to a certain extent. In this paper, we use a data low-intensity method to evaluate the urban traffic resilience under the circumstance of restricted car use. In addition, we incorporate the impact of ridesharing services. The research in this paper can be regarded as an evaluation framework, which can help policy makers and relevant operators to grasp the overall resilience characteristics of cities in emergencies, identify weak sectors, and formulate the best response plan. This method has been successfully applied to two cities in China, demonstrating its potential for practice. Finally, we also explored the relationship between urban traffic resilience and the pattern of population distribution. The analysis shows that population density has an impact on the level of transportation resilience. And the incorporation of ridesharing will bring an obvious increment in resilience of most areas.
