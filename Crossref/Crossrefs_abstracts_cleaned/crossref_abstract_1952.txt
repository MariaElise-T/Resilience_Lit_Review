 With transistors reaching nanometer dimensions, dissipated energy has become of great importance in recent years. A practical approach to reducing energy consumption is to use logic-in-memory (LIM) structures based on magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices combined with approximate computing. In this paper, we propose energy-efficient MTJ/FinFET-based approximate 5:2 compressors for error-resilient in-memory computing, providing an accuracy close to the exact design (1.54% error rate) while reducing the energy consumption by more than 50%. The innovative Boolean equations and the structure of the proposed approximate circuits based on spin-Hall effect assisted MTJs lead to a significantly more effective compromise between energy and accuracy than the previous exact and approximate counterparts. The simulation results provided using HSPICE with 7[Formula: see text]nm FinFETs and SHE-assisted MTJ models demonstrate the superior hardware parameters of the proposed designs. Furthermore, the MATLAB simulations show an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of more than 43 and an average structural similarity index metric (SSIM) of more than 0.99 across image multiplication, sharpening, and smoothing operations.
