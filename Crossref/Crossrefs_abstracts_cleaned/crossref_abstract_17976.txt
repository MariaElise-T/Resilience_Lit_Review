 Existing research has indicated an association between resilience and psychosocial adjustment to disability. The purpose of this study was to validate the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) in a sample of vocational rehabilitation (VR) consumers. Participants were 277 individuals with disabilities receiving state VR services. Findings support the identification of two factors in the BRS, labeled succumbing and resilience by the researchers. The succumbing factor was positively associated with reporting of depression while the resilience factor was associated with well-being. Implications for practice in state VR agencies are provided.
