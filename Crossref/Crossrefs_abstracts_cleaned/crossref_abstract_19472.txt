Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced adolescents to adapt rapidly to a new reality of physical and social distancing, while introducing a range of new sources of stress and adversity. Our primary aim was to study the relationship between adolescents’ resilience and their participation in online sports programs during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. Our secondary aims were to assess the associations between the organized sports programs’ determinants and resilience. Methods: Online surveys designed to examine resilience, lifestyle, psychosocial health and characteristics of the organized sports programs were administered to 473 adolescents who were enrolled in organized sports programs before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Adolescents who continued to participate in online structured programs during the lockdown period were significantly more resilient and physically active, had higher self-related health, satisfaction with life, and ability to cope during the pandemic, compared to those who did not participate. Relationships with the adult instructor and levels of physical activity were the most important factors of the programs that were associated with resilience. Conclusions: Participation of adolescents in sports programs is an important resource associated with higher levels of resilience. Youth programs should continue their activities during globally challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
