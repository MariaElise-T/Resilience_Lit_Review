ABSTRACT
The gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders. Probiotics can benefit the central nervous system via the microbiota–gut–brain axis, which raises the possibility that probiotics are effective in managing depression. In the present study, we examined the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus helveticus strain MCC1848 in subchronic and mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) model mice (a widely used animal model of depression). MCC1848 supplementation significantly enhanced the interaction time in the social interaction test and sucrose preference ratio in the sucrose preference test, suggesting that MCC1848 improved anxiety- or depressive-like behaviors in sCSDS mice. The gene expression profile analysis of the nucleus accumbens, which plays an important role in stress resilience, indicated that MCC1848 ameliorated sCSDS-induced gene expression alterations in signal transduction or nervous system development. These findings suggest that MCC1848 supplementation is useful as a preventive strategy for chronic-stress-induced depression.
