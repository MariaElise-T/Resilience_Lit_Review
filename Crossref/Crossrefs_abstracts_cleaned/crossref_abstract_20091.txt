Objective Evidence on the relationship between resilience and medication adherence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is lacking. We aimed to examine the impact of resilience on medication adherence in SLE patients. Method In a cross-sectional analysis SLE outpatients were assessed for resilience (Connor-Davison Resilience Scale, CD-RISC), depressive symptoms (CES-D) and medication adherence (Compliance Questionnaire for Rheumatology [CQR]). The disease activity index (mexSLEDAI) and damage (SLICC Damage Index) were administered. Factors independently associated with adherence were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Results Of the 157 patients, 152 (96.8%) were female with a median age of 45.9 (IQR: 39.0-55.5) years and disease duration of 14 (IQR: 10.0-19.0) years. Medication adherence (CQR â‰¥80%) and depressive symptoms were found in 74.5% and 43.9% of patients, respectively. Adherent patients had a lower CES-D score and a higher CD-RISC score. In the multivariate analysis adjusting for demographic and clinical confounders, resilience and older age protected against non-adherence (OR 0.96, [95% CI 0.94-0.99] and OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.93-0.98], respectively). Conclusion In SLE patients, resilience and older age, which possibly associated with better medication adherence, may protect against non-adherence.
