Background Owing to the loss of autonomy associated with aging, home-dwelling older people often need the support of family and friends, particularly of a family caregiver whose demanding role can have negative health consequences. The empirical literature reports that some caregivers are resilient and continue to grow and develop, whereas others have difficulty coping with the role and suffer psychological distress. Aims The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of personal and contextual factors to the resilience of female family caregivers of home-dwelling functionally or cognitively impaired older people in Lebanon. Methods A predictive correlational design was used. The study was conducted with a cohort of 140 female primary family caregivers cohabiting with an older person aged 65 years or over. Data were collected through home-based structured interviews. Results Four factors were shown to be significantly associated with caregiver resilience: problem-focused coping strategies, emotion-focused coping strategies, sense of self-efficacy and caregiver meaning of caregiving. Conclusion The study offers potential priorities for nursing interventions aimed at promoting caregiver resilience. The results enable the creation of the foundations of a transferable contextual theory of resilience among female family caregivers in Lebanon.
