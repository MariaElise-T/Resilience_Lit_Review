Distressed destinations have distinctive exogenous factors influencing the survival of small to medium enterprises during and postcrisis. Using COVID-19-induced crisis cases in a distressed nation, this study interrogates the underpinnings for the survival and failure of small and medium
 tourism enterprises during a crisis. The study adopted a qualitative research approach and a critical instance case study research design where interviews were used to obtain data from small and medium enterprise owners. Responses from participants were analyzed through thematic analysis.
 From the study, it emerged that the major survival nodes include strong political connections, social capital, lack of policy enforcement, and chaotic currency system and facility conversion to suit the prevailing environment. A framework that gives small and medium enterprises insights and
 tools to manage their businesses during a severe crisis operating environment is proposed. The article narrows the gap in crisis management and resilience literature of small to medium enterprises in developing countries.
