 In the United States, Black women living with HIV face various individual (e.g. trauma) and structural (e.g. racism) adversities. However, resilience is understudied among Black women living with HIV. A total of 100 Black women living with HIV in the United States completed measures of resilience, general self-efficacy, self-esteem, post-traumatic growth, trauma symptoms, trauma-related cognitions, and depressive symptoms. Regressions controlling for age and education indicated that higher resilience was associated with higher general self-efficacy (β = .39, p < .001), higher self-esteem (β = .48, p < .001), higher post-traumatic growth (β = .34, p < .01), lower post-traumatic cognitions (β = –.36, p < .001), lower trauma symptoms (β = –.29, p < .01), and lower depressive symptoms (β = –.38, p < .001). Our findings suggest potential targets for interventions.
