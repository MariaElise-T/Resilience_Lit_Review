The evaluation of community disaster resilience is of great practical importance for building low-risk, sustainable, and disaster-resistant cities. With 12 communities in Luoyang as the objects, this paper adopts entropy weight TOPSIS and obstacle diagnosis to study the community disaster resilience of Luoyang from seven dimensions, such as demographic characteristics, economic development, and infrastructure. The results of the study are as follows: (1) the community disaster resilience of Luoyang (0.48) is at a medium level. Community capital is the main influencing factor of community disaster resilience. Government governance, community capacity, and community intelligence are the components that need attention in the construction of Luoyangâ€™s community disaster resilience. (2) The community disaster resilience of Luoyang presents a decreasing trend from rural to urban areas. Moreover, communities with high disaster resilience are less than communities with low disaster resilience. (3) The obstacle to community disaster resilience of Luoyang focuses on population, economic development, and infrastructure. In addition, community trust, community dependence, popularization and intellectualization of disaster prevention information, and disaster information sharing also significantly restrict the construction of Luoyang community disaster resilience. (4) According to the results of sensitivity analysis, the entropy weight TOPSIS evaluation results are less sensitive. Moreover, changing the weight value, weight method, and evaluation method will not lead to major changes in the rankings.
