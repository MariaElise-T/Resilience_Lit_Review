	This article examines the effectiveness of a career-oriented intervention for preventing involvement with alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATODs) and violence and for promoting resilient behavior among eighth-grade, African American middle school students (N=178; n=92 intervention and n=86 comparison) through the implementation of the Building Resiliency and Vocational Excellence (BRAVE) Program. Students were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Students in the evaluation participated in the school-based BRAVE Program intervention and the standard public school curriculum. Comparison students participated only in the standard curriculum. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and violent behavior were assessed for 178 students at baseline, post-test, and one-year follow up (one year after baseline). Results revealed a beneficial effect of the intervention on participantsâ€™ frequency of use of alcohol (p<.04) and marijuana (p<.05), but no effect for violent behavior.
