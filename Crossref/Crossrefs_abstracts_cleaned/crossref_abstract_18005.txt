The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, including those in the food industry, posing significant challenges to food security and sustainable production. This study focuses on investigating the resilience of Pakistan's wheat supply chain during the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on the concept of supply chain flexibility. Through structured interviews with 50 individuals involved in the wheat supply the study examines the impact of proactive capability, supply chain design, and reactive capability on the resilience of the wheat supply chain. The findings reveal that proactive capability in the wheat supply chain demonstrated flexibility in various aspects, except for sourcing. Integration among departments showed collaboration, but issues were encountered in information sharing and efficiency. The readiness of the supply chain showed detection ability but lacked training and strong security measures. Supply chain design complexities were observed in direct dealings and a lack of flexibility in flow. Reactive capability indicated challenges in quick response, crisis mitigation, and recovery, emphasizing the importance of response teams and financial readiness. The study provides valuable insights for supply chain managers, highlighting areas for improvement such as sourcing strategies, information management, quality control, and financial support. Future research could explore other sectors and agricultural products, investigating different geographical areas, and increasing the sample size. By further understanding the dynamics of supply chain resilience and flexibility, organizations can better prepare for and respond to disruptions, ensuring the continuity of critical food supply chains during crises.
