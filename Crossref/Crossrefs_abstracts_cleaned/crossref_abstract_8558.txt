 The resilient asynchronous dissipative control problem for Markov jump systems with sector-bounded nonlinearities in the discrete-time domain are examined in this study. The jumps between the system modes and controller modes are considered to be nonsynchronous. The mode transition of the controllers is governed by a nonstationary Markov chain, which can model the asynchronous jumps to different degrees that are also mode-dependent. The nonlinear functions are assumed to belong to sector sets with arbitrary boundaries. The sector boundaries can have positive and/or negative slopes, and therefore, we cover the most general case in our approach. Using the special structure of the system and by constructing a new multiple Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions regarding the existence of desired resilient asynchronous dissipative controllers are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which ensure the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and strictly dissipative. The designed controller can tolerate additive uncertainties in the controller gain matrix, which results from controller implementations. A numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.
