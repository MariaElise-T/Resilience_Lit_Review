Bight of Benin coast is highly vulnerable to climate change and one of its negative effects: sea level rise. It affects the coastal zones of Ghana, Togo and Benin. Within these areas, a substantial impact is expected not only on livelihoods but also on key infrastructure in coastal areas, leading to the destruction of coastal line and its habitats, socio-economic mutations and beach erosion increase. In Togo, the erosion retreat, due to improper coastal and infrastructure management, has been estimated between 5 to 10 meters per year during the period 1955-1985 and 20 to 30 meters per year during the period 1985-2009, forcing the coastal road linking LomÃ© to AnÃ©ho to be moved twice. Taking into consideration climate change, this figure will progressively increase. Under the African Development Fund 13th cycle (2014 - 2017), the African Development Bank (AfDB) is supporting the Togolese governmentâ€™s effort of strengthening regional integration through the financing of transport infrastructure, in particular the â€œrehabilitation of the corridor Lome-Cotonou and transport facilitation projectâ€. The main objective of AfDB project is to finance the related infrastructure and capacity building that will make coastal infrastructure, roads in particular, climate resilient.
