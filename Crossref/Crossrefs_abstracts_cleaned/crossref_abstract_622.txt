Climate change is one of the global challenges faced by the mankind today with the continuously rising temperature, triggering a host of extreme weather events such as heat waves, drought, and flooding. These climate induced challenges are manifesting themselves rapidly, causing socio-economic insecurities and health challenges, particularly in marginalized communities. There is increasing evidence of indirect associations between climate change and the rise in the rates of malnutrition, poor health, hunger and starvation, as well as food and water insecurity. In addition, climate-change impacts have put an additional pressure on already stressed natural resource base, reducing the resilience of agro-ecosystems that are, in part, providing food and nutritional security in rural communities. Tackling these challenges requires a paradigm shift from the current incremental adaptation strategies towards transformative alternatives that also place an equal emphasis on human nutrition and health, as well as environmental sustainability. In the context of marginalized farming communities, a transformative adaptation strategy is defined as one that causes a disruptive, but desirable and sustainable change to the socialâ€“ ecological state of the system. In the context of this paper, the inclusion of adaptable nutrient dense vegetable crops into marginalized agricultural systems and dominant food systems is considered part of transformative adaptation.
