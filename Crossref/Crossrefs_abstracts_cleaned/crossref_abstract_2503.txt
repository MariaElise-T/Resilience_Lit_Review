INTRODUCTION: Today, the expansion of urbanization has located cities and residential areas in places exposed to various types of hazards. Natural hazards are characterized by low predictability and can cause numerous human and financial losses to urban settlements. Making cities resilient is one of the United Nations International strategies for disaster mitigation. With this background in mind, the present study aimed to prepare a physical-social resilience map of the study area.
METHODS: This descriptive-analytical identified the criteria and indicators of physical and social dimensions after the revision of experimental and theoretical texts. After the identification of indicators, the map of the resilience or non-resilience of the indicators was prepared in binary form. Finally, two methods of Boolean and indicator overlap were used to combine the layers. In the current research, the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process-Technique (FAHP) was used for weighting the map of the studied layers.
FINDINGS: Based on the result of the Boolean model map, more than half of the total district will be non-resilient. Nonetheless,  according to the result of the indicator overlap method, 7.68%, 24.71%, and 67.61% of the total district has low, average, and high resilience, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the resilience map obtained in the study area, it can be stated that resilience in these areas is not favorable. Moreover, Darband region and its surrounding streets are not in good condition. Therefore, management programs should be implemented in low-resilient areas before the onset of disasters.
