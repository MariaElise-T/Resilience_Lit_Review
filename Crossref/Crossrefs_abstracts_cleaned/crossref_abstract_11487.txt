 To achieve urban resilience, assessment of the bioclimatic impact of various planning solutions should be given high priority in the decision-making process for the implementation of urban planning interventions. To aid in this process and improve the creation of resilient open spaces, the Bioclimatic Index has been developed as an evaluation tool and simple guide for local stakeholders. The assessment of the indicator is essential to determine the likelihood of its use in other Mediterranean cities as the methodological framework was based on the microclimate simulation results of the case study area of Patras Old Port, which is a seaside open space with a Mediterranean climate. In this framework, the Bioclimatic Index is used to rate the regenerated open spaces in Thessaloniki, Malaga, and Genoa, three Mediterranean seaside areas. The indicator values are compared to the microclimate simulation results created based on their planning solutions, aiming to test the accuracy, transferability and scalability of the indicator. The research result showed that the seaside space of Malaga, which has been evaluated as the optimal regeneration plan based on the Bioclimatic Index, creates the most favorable microclimate conditions through seasons, supporting the use of the indicator for evaluating the bioclimatic impact of regeneration plans in Mediterranean cities.
