The control and measurement for resilient recovery is important for a supply network facing disruption. Outer synchronization is useful for the supply network to recover to its scheduled state. In this paper, a dynamic model for a supply network is established, and measurement with memory of resilient recovery is proposed based on outer synchronization. An impulsive controller is designed to improve the control effectiveness. Afterwards, an algorithm is adopted to identify the resilient recovery backbone. Based on these factors, an efficient resilient recovery method considering cost is applied in the case study. This study improves the measurement and control of the supply networkâ€™s resilient recovery through outer synchronization, and is easily integrated with practical problems to make better control decisions.
