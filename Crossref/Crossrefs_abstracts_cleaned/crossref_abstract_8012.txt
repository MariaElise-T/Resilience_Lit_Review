Psychological resilience is the ability to manage psychologically or emotionally with a catastrophe or to swiftly recover to pre-crisis position. Adversity is one of the most important abilities for psychological resilience. Workers in the twenty-first century must be able to deal with adversity in a challenging work environment, especially during  a  pandemic.The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  level  of  adversity  quotient  among  Malaysian employees during the pandemic period. Different employees' ability adversity quotients have also been compared in terms of gender, race, and age. This study's design is a cross-sectional surveywith 585 respondents from all around Malaysia  selected  using  a  convenient  sampling  technique.  A  modified  version  of  Dr.  Paul  G.  Stoltz's  Adversity Response Profile was employed as instrumentin this study. The data was then analysed with the sum, median, mean, standard  deviation,  independent-sample  t-test,  and  logistic  regression.The  findings  of  the  study  show  that  the majority of employees have a high adversity quotient score.In terms of gender, men employees tend to score higher than female employees. Employees aged 50 and over excel those aged 26 and below. However, the adversity quotient score for employees of different races is not significantly different. Employers should eventually take serious concern by  implementing  the  appropriate  intervention  programme  or  policy  aimed  at  potential  employees  in  order  to overcome  their shortcoming  in the  adversity quotientand,  more  importantly, to enhance the  employee's ability to face challenges in order to drive the company's mission and vision.
