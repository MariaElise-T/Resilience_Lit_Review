PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the importance of supplier innovativeness (SI), top management support (TMS) and strategic sourcing (SS) in the development of supply chain (SC) resilience. The study also argues that organization culture (OC) strongly influences SI, TMS and SS in their importance in generating SC resilience.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a cross-sectional approach for collecting online-survey-based responses for evaluating the validity of the proposed associations. Respondents were chosen ensuring that they have sufficient exposure in SC operations in their respective designations. With two reminders, around 212 completed responses were received and analyzed using partial least squares in SmartPLS 2.0.M3.FindingsFindings suggested TMS as a positive enabler of SC resilience. However, although SI and SS had positive influences, they were not significant. The study argues that this may be attributed to the presence of OC as a strong precursor for SI, TMS and SS. The findings showed that OC is indeed a strong predictor of SI, TMS and SS.Originality/valueThe study has undersigned empirically the influence of OC in the development of SI, TMS and SS. The study is the foremost to acknowledge the influence of SI, TMS and SS on SC resilience.
