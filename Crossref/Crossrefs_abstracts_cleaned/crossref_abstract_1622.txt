Abstract

Introduction
The psychosocial needs of nursing students are a pressing matter as mental health disorders may affect nursing studentsâ€™ journeys as professional nurses.


Literature Review
Psychological distress and burnout in nurses are threats to worldwide health care, as the stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to an unstable future global nurse workforce.


Discussion
Resiliency training can positively impact nurse stress, mindfulness, and resilience, as resilient nurses are better able to manage their response to stress and adversity which will contribute to positive patient outcomes.


Implications for an International Audience
Educating faculty on resilience will aid nurse educators to create new student instructional approaches to improve mental health wellness.


Conclusions
Supportive faculty behaviors, self-care techniques, and resilience-building infused throughout the nursing curriculum may promote the effective transitioning of students into practice, providing the necessary foundation for improving workplace stress management and increasing longevity and satisfaction in the profession.
