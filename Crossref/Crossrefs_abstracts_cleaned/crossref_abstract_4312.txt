AbstractIn this paper, we articulate a multi‐level resilience‐based framework explaining how firms facilitate stronger system‐level resilience. The framework stresses the importance of firm interdependence, describing how pooled versus sequential/reciprocal patterns of interdependence influence the resilience antecedents of diversity, slack, and redundancy. We argue that the inter‐firm practices of self‐governance and supply chain collaboration function to maintain resilience antecedents at more moderate and effective levels. This work builds on prior resilience research that has remained focused on either firm or system levels of analysis by stressing the value of firm interdependence as an important contingency for effective system resilience.
