Given the rise in both the type and volume of uncertainty in the global business environment, MNCs face challenges in realizing the tools and skills necessary to foster both their own resilience and that of the communities in which they operate. The articles in this special issue aim to provide guidance to multinationals and other stakeholders on building international business and societal resilience in an uncertain global environment. The introductory editorial article outlines the complexity of resilience-building and discusses different types of resilience relevant to MNCs. It then overviews the six articles in the special issue, which relate broadly to the themes of supply chain resilience, global disruptions and volatility in the external environment, and organizational resilience.
