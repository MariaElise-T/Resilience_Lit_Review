PurposeRecent research has highlighted the beneficial role of supply chain resilience for ensuring efficient production and business processes. The purpose of this study is to explore enablers of supply chain resilience. In particular, the authors examine whether and how dynamic capabilities and knowledge management can help firms develop a resilient supply chain in times of high disruption and uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachA single longitudinal case study design was adopted. Data was collected over 8Â years from a Pakistani textile producer and supplier through semi-structured interviews and was analyzed through NVivo to generate codes and themes that contributed to the development of the supply chain resilience model.FindingsThe analysis of case study shows that our focal firm strategically acquired, transferred and integrated market knowledge by investing in digital technologies and idiosyncratic resources and consequently developed a supply chain model that was resilient in addressing logistics and delivery challenges in uncertain & critical times.Research limitations/implicationsThe study brings together three main research streams of organizational theory, namely supply chain, knowledge management and dynamic capabilities, and proposes a nuanced resilient supply chain model.Practical implicationsBy applying the research findings, managers can adjust, develop and adopt supply chain resilience to address market volatilities, thereby creating value and longevity in their supply chain operations. However, the findings are context specific and should be applied cautiously.Originality/valueThe outcomes provide early hints on how companies in emerging economies can adopt and integrate novel digital technologies, and overhaul their organizational routines to facilitate knowledge management and develop dynamic capabilities, and consequently enhance the resilience of their supply chain operations.
