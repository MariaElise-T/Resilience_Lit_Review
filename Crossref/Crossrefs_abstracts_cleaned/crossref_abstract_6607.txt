During the rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the construction of the Thunder God Mountain Hospital (TGMH) in a harsh environment significantly lowered the burden of medical assistance in Wuhan, demonstrating the significance of organizational resilience in construction projects to handle harsh environments. This paper aims to explore the impact of organizational collaboration patterns on organizational resilience in construction projects and to outline the lessons that can be gained for similar projects. Firstly, an extensive literature review was conducted to determine organizational resilience indicators and corresponding complex network parameters, followed by a content analysis approach to identify the organizations involved and their collaboration behaviors. Secondly, the obtained organizations and collaboration data were used to construct an organization collaboration network for the TGMH project. The results of the complex network analysis show the following as critical factors affecting organizational resilience: (1) the one core multi-center organizational collaboration structure; (2) the small group relationships among organizations; and (3) assortative ties between organizations with diverse backgrounds. This study contributes to providing a feasible research framework for assessing organizational resilience from the perspective of organizational collaboration and practical suggestions for other construction projects to improve organizational resilience when faced with large public emergencies.
