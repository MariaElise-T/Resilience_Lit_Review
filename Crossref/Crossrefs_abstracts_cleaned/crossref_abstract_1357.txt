Objective:To assess the effects of a multi-modal resilience program, the Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) Program, on healthcare professional well-being and job satisfaction.Methods:This pilot, mixed-methods, quality improvement, cohort study assessed perceived stress, physical and mental health, job satisfaction, burnout, and value of the curriculum to attendees.Results:Participants experienced a significant reduction in perceived stress (P < 0.001) and significant improvements in global mental health (P = 0.001), physical health (P = 0.045), and job satisfaction (P = 0.047). There was no significant improvement in burnout. Qualitative analysis of free text responses revealed appreciation for the skills taught, increased resiliency, and a positive impact on relationships.Conclusions:Delivering the SMART Program to healthcare professionals is feasible and may serve as a useful tool for reducing stress and increasing resilience.
