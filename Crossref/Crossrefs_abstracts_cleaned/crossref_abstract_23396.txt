AbstractPurposeMedical physics residents (MPRs) will define and shape the future of physics in medicine. We sought to better understand the residency experience, as related to resilience and well‐being, through the lens of current MPRs and medical physicists (MPs) working with residents.Methods and materialsFrom February–May 2019, we conducted 32, 1‐h, confidential, semi‐structured interviews with MPs either currently enrolled in an accredited residency (n = 16) or currently employed by a department with an accredited residency (n = 16). Interviews centered on the topics of mentorship, work/life integration, and discrimination. Qualitative analysis methods were used to derive key themes from the interview transcripts.ResultsWith regard to the medical physics residency experience, four key themes emerged during qualitative analysis: the demanding nature of medical physics residencies, the negative impacts of residency on MPRs during training and beyond, strategies MPRs use to cope with residency stress, and the role of professional societies in addressing residency‐related change.ConclusionsResidency training is a stress‐inducing time in the path to becoming a board‐certified MP. By uncovering several sources of this stress, we have identified opportunities to support the resiliency and well‐being of MPs in training through recommendations by professional societies, programmatic changes, and interventions at the department and residency program director level for residency programs, as well as strategies that MPRs themselves can use to support well‐being on their career journey.
