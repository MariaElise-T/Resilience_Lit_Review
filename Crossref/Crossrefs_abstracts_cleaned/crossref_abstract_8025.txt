This paper outlines the main challenges faced by the supply chain in the wood-based materials sector in the context of building resilience. The research work carried out made it possible to identify the main problems in the selected supply chain from the wood-based industry. They are associated with the occurrence of negative effects, including the destruction of the pallet, aging of goods in the warehouse, high packaging costs, and inefficient transport processes realization, including the processes of handling pallet units. In the context of external risks, a particular challenge is the shortage of raw materials on the market. The analyzed case study is based on the supply chain resilience assessment with regard to resilience potentials evaluation.
