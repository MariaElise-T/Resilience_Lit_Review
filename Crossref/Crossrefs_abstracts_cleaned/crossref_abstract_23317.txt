 In addition to physical disorders, people with hemophilia face complex psychological problems. Hence, protective factors such as coping strategies, social support, and spirituality to improve psychological health should be determined. This study examined the role of courageous coping as a mediator in the interrelationships between spirituality as well as social support and resilience among adolescents with hemophilia. In this descriptive-analytical study, the participants were 372 adolescents with hemophilia aged 11–21 years. Connor–Davidson resilience scale, Jalowiec Coping scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, and spirituality scale were the instruments used in this study. The analysis results of Pearson correlation revealed a significant positive relationship between spirituality as well as social support and resilience. Also, it was determined that courageous coping is a thorough mediator between spirituality and resilience. The mediating role of courageous coping did not reach meaningful levels between social support and resilience, meaning that zero was included in bootstrap interval, CI 95% (β =.026, CI [-.002, .089]). Social support, adopting a spiritual strategy, and using coping strategies played a crucial role among the adolescents to promote their level of resilience to cope with hemophilia.
