 The COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation for many older adults, causing concern for their health and well-being. To enhance understanding of how community-dwelling older adults were impacted by prolonged social isolation during COVID-19, a qualitative descriptive study was conducted to: (1) explore the self-reported factors supporting their resilience during COVID-19 related social isolation, and (2) to help understand the intentional and unintentional outcomes of the government mandated health measures. A total of 19 community dwelling older adults were sampled. Factors that supported older adultsâ€™ resilience during COVID-19 included maintaining positivity, drawing on historical experiences of resilience and finding opportunities to connect with their community. However, collective safety came with losses: such as time, freedom, opportunity, engagement, and initiative. The findings provide insight on contributing factors to resilience against social isolation in older adults and suggest the value of collective, community-based approaches to build resilience across variable contexts in this population.
