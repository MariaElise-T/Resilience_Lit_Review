Organizational resilience is the ability of an organization to plan, organize emergency, crises, intervention, and resurgence in terms of business continuity. The evaluation of organizational resilience helps organizations to increase their awareness on environment and their ability to react to threats. In this respect, this paper firstly aims to evaluate and contrast healthcare organizations’ resilience prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly this paper aims to gather data about the strong and weak sides of healthcare organizations and raise awareness on crises. Besides, it will help healthcare organizations to engage in a fruitful planning process concerning the key risks and crises they face. The research took place in healthcare organizations which have a dynamic and uninterrupted service by nature but have at the same time complexity, diversity, and uncertainty. Data were gathered from the employees of a public university hospital and a private hospital by a survey applied to 350 participants. As the results show, the private hospital dissociates positively from the university hospital in terms of resilience measurements. Participants show their institution’s strength in terms of participation in exercises, planning strategies, silo mentality and weakness in encouraging innovation &amp; creativity. Besides, there are significant differences between the responses of decision makers and employees.
