PurposeAs the global freight transport network has experienced high vulnerability and threats from both natural and man-made disasters, as a result, a huge amount of data is generated in freight transport system in form of continuous streams; it is becoming increasingly important to develop sustainable and resilient transport system to recover from any unforeseen circumstances quickly and efficiently. The aim of this paper is to develop a stream processing data driven decision-making model for higher environmental performance and resilience in sustainable logistics infrastructure by using fifteen dimensions with three interrelated domains.Design/methodology/approachA causal and hierarchical stream processing data driven decision-making model to evaluate the impact of different attributes and their interrelationships and to measure the level of environmental performance and resilience capacity of sustainable logistics infrastructure are proposed. This work uses fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) techniques. A real-life case under a disruptive event scenario is further conducted.FindingsThe result shows which attributes have a greater impact on the level of environmental performance and resilience capacity in sustainable logistics infrastructure.Originality/valueIn this paper, causal and hierarchical stream processing data decision and control system model was proposed by identified three domains and fifteen dimensions to assess the level of environmental performance and resilience in sustainable logistics infrastructure. The proposed model gives researchers and practitioners insights about sustainability trade-offs for a resilient and sustainable global transport supply chain system by enabling to model interdependencies among the decision attributes under a fuzzy environment and streaming data.
