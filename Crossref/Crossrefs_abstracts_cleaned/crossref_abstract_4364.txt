Frequent natural disasters have put forward higher requirements for the comprehensive ability of disaster prevention and resilience in urban areas with a large number of people, and green space, as the most commonly used land for disaster prevention and risk avoidance, plays a key role in disaster prevention and risk avoidance. As a new development area in Chengdu, the central area of Chengdu has a long history and extensive population density, but there are still problems such as insufficient per capita park green space, imperfect road network structure, "misalignment" between the layout of green space for disaster prevention and risk avoidance and urban population density, and the hot spots of residents' production and life. Based on ArcGIS network analysis, Open Street Map traffic network analysis and existing Gaussian theory, this paper analyzes the rationality of the spatial layout of the existing green space for disaster prevention and risk avoidance in the central urban area of Chengdu by combining the four indicators of population ratio served, service area ratio, per capita avoidable area and population allocation gap. Based on Chengdu's "14th Five-Year Plan" for disaster prevention and mitigation, this project will first summarize the evaluation system of resilient cities at home and abroad, try to build a resilient city evaluation system suitable for Chinese cities, and then conduct a comprehensive analysis through satellite cloud data and POI point of interest crawling to preliminarily determine the reasons for the failure to meet the standard, and then conduct field research on the field feelings of residents around a certain part of the green belt around the city. It can be summarized as follows: (1) Combined with literature review, the theoretical and practical results of the existing research and evaluation on the accessibility of disaster prevention green space at home and abroad were fitted. Through the theoretical and research results, the regional characteristics and geological hazards of the disaster-prevention green space in the Chengdu Ring Ecological Zone were determined, and the residents in the central area of Chengdu were questioned based on a questionnaire survey to understand their cognition of the disaster-prevention green space and the current status of disaster-prevention green space services. (2) Based on the theory of resilient city, for the research on the accessibility of special disaster prevention green space, the buffer zone analysis method, the kernel density analysis method, the two-step mobile search method, and the traffic resistance accessibility evaluation model were comprehensively used to evaluate the accessibility of emergency shelters from the aspects of service radius buffer zone analysis, per capita service analysis, and per capita accessibility road analysis of disaster prevention green space, and the relevant data of the overall disaster prevention accessibility evaluation of Chengdu Ring Ecological Zone were calculated. The scoring results of each ecological region were Qingyang District (0.2547), Jinjiang District (0.2507), Wuhou District (0.2336), Chenghua District (0.2119), and Jinniu District (0.2547). (3) Based on the evaluation results and data, combined with the research results, the accessibility optimization scheme of Chengdu Ring Ecological Zone was analyzed. There are common problems in all districts, such as the mismatch between refuge sites and human settlements, the lack of refuge sites in road sections with high accessibility, and the isolation of the utilization rate of refuge sites. In view of the above problems, it is proposed to fully integrate the living environment to set up a disaster prevention green space. Disaster prevention green space traffic optimization and priority measures; Raise awareness of the use of disaster-proof green space facilities and resource conservation. Under the theoretical system of disaster prevention green space accessibility evaluation system, this paper uses the perspective of resilient city to construct special research data and optimization measures for Chengdu Ring City Ecozone.
