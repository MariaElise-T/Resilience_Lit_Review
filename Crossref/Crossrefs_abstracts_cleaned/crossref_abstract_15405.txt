AbstractObjectiveThe aims of this study were to investigate the current state of psychological resilience and identify its associated factors in bladder cancer (BC) patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC).MethodsA cross‐sectional study, using convenience sampling was conducted among 248 patients recruited from urology department of a tertiary hospital in Shenyang, China. According to the resilience in illness model, participants were invited to finish a questionnaire included demographic and disease‐related information, Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, Social Support Rating Scale, Family adaptation, partnership, growth, affection, and resolve Index and Herth Hope Index. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the predictors of resilience.ResultsThe average resilience score of 53.45 ± 6.22 among BC patients undergoing RC. Multiple regression showed that the associated factors of resilience of postoperative BC patients were gender (β = −0.142, p = 0.002), living in town (β = −0.103, p = 0.052), living alone (β = 0.118, p = 0.026), almost need to be taken care of (β = 0.094, p = 0.064), illness uncertainty (β = −0.249, p < 0.001), confrontation (β = 0.091, p = 0.077), acceptance‐resignation (β = −0.205, p < 0.001), social support (β = 0.122, p = 0.029) and hope (β = 0.350, p < 0.001). These predictors accounted for 56.9% of the total variance in resilience (F = 14.964, p < 0.001).ConclusionsResilience among BC patients undergoing RC needs to be further improved. Hope was the most important variable influencing resilience in BC patients undergoing RC. In the future, we need to pay more attention to the psychological status of patients and encourage them to face the disease with positive emotion and positive coping style to enhance the hope and resilience of patients, so as to improve the quality of life of patients with BC undergoing RC.
