This article discusses the challenges faced by people in the adoption process who are living with HIV, looking especially at resilience factors. Resilience is framed in the context of HIV-related infertility that motivates people living with HIV to apply for adoption. The article draws on psychological definitions of resilience and presents four factors that promote and sustain it: individual strengths, good health management, social network and wider recognition in society. This is illustrated by a case study. The study emphasises that ‘the prospective adoptive child’ should always be at the centre of any assessments and encourages social workers to consider sensitive and inclusive practice when assessing prospective adopters living with HIV.
