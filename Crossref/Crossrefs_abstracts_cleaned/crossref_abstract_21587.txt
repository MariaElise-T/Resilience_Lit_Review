 10029  Background: Parents of children with cancer experience significant levels of distress, which may negatively impact surviving patients and family members. Positive psychology interventions have shown promise, but few address the well-being of parents. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of a resilience intervention, Promoting Resilience in Stress Management-Parent (PRISM-P), among parents of children with cancer. Methods: This study was a phase 2, 1:1:1 RCT. Eligible participants were English-speaking parents of children 2-24 years-old receiving cancer-directed therapy at Seattle Children’s Hospital. PRISM-P is a skills-based program targeting resilience resources. Parents were randomized to usual care (UC), UC plus individual PRISM-P (1:1), or UC plus group PRISM-P (group). Parents completed surveys at baseline and 3 months measuring resilience (primary outcome, 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRISC)) and other secondary outcomes including stress, social support, and benefit-finding. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using unadjusted linear mixed-effects modeling to estimate PRISM effects on score change. With n = 25 per arm, we achieved 80% power to detect an effect size (CDRISC change) of 5.1 (Cohen’s d = 0.8) with a type 1 error rate of 0.05. Results: 107 parents enrolled. Of these, 94 (88%) completed baseline surveys and 77 (72%) completed 3 month surveys. Mean (SD) resilience score change in UC, 1:1 and group arms was -2 (3.5), 1 (5.3) and -1 (5.0), respectively. In mixed models, the estimated 1:1 PRISM benefit for resilience score change vs. UC was +2.8 (95% CI: 0.5,5.2, p = 0.02) while there was no evidence of a group benefit (beta 0.4, 95% CI: -2.1, 2.8, p = 0.76.). Models for secondary outcome score change found a PRISM advantage for benefit finding, where the 1:1 vs. UC difference was +0.5 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.8, p < 0.01) and the group vs. UC difference was +0.4 (0.0, 0.7, p = 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to UC, 1:1 PRISM-P was associated with improved resilience change, and both PRISM-P intervention arms were associated with greater benefit-finding. Future studies will explore larger scale efficacy and alternative delivery design. Clinical trial information: NCT02998086.
