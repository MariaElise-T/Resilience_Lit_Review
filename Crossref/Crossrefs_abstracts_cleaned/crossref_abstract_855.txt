The fish community of Lake Victoria, East Africa, has continued to exhibit an intriguing degree of resiliency despite stress from anthropogenic activities. Frequent environmental perturbations include wild fluctuations in fishing pressure, limnological conditions, and lake levels. Surprisingly, many of the endemic and other indigenous fishes have survived, and some have even increased in numbers in recent years. While a positive development, this resiliency is a red flag to scientists because we do not understand it, or know whether it can be expected to continue. Furthermore, besides issues of immediate human well-being, there remain grave concerns about long term resource sustainability. This paper explores possible reasons for ecological resilience in the Lake Victoria fish community, with a focus on omnivory and functional redundancy as possible explanations. The analysis used published data based on both traditional gut content analysis (GCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Trophic plasticity is ubiquitous among the surviving fishes of Lake Victoria. This, combined with an overall simplification of the food web, contributed to the lake community's current resilience.
