Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging psychiatric condition to treat. Previous research has explored various aspects of treatment response, but limited attention has been given to the significance of psychological flexibility and resilience. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between psychological flexibility, resilience, and different dimensions of OCD, as well as their role in treatment response specifically concerning OCD symptom sub-dimensions. The study involved 50 OCD patients and 42 healthy individuals as controls. Participants completed the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-2), and Resilience Scale for Adults (RS). Initial scale scores were compared to post-treatment scores obtained after a 3-month follow-up using pharmacotherapy. The patient group exhibited significantly higher AAQ-2 scores and lower RS scores compared to the control group. During the post-treatment follow-up, a reduction in DOCS and AAQ-2 scores was observed, along with an increase in RS scores. The impact of differences in AAQ-2 and RS scores on the change in DOCS total scores was analyzed using mixed model linear regression analysis. The results showed a statistically significant effect of changes in AAQ-2 and RS sub-dimension scores on the change in DOCS total scores. The findings highlight the importance of flexibility and resilience in influencing treatment response among patients with OCD. When conventional pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy approaches prove insufficient, interventions focused on enhancing flexibility and resilience may contribute to improved treatment outcomes.
