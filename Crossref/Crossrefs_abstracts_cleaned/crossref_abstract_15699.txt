This research was a cross-sectional study among 30 Public Health Centers in flood-prone areas of East Java Province that experienced floods from September to October 2021. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the suitability of the structural model of Public Health Center resilience. The validity of the questionnaire has been tested using the Coefficient of Reproducibility and Coefficient of Scalability with values of Kr = 0.903 and Ks = 0.903 so that it is declared valid. Results. The results showed that the reliability value = 0.843>0.7, which indicates adequate reliability. All items in the Health Center Resilience questionnaire have a factor loading greater than 0.32 and obtained AVE > 0.5, which indicates good convergent validity, and CR obtained > 0.7 means that the questions in the questionnaire are reliable. Conclusion. In conclusion, there are 13 indicators that make up the significant Public Health Center Resilience questionnaire.
