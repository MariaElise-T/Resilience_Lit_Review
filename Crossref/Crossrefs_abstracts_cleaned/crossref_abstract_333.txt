AbstractElectrical power generation, transmission, and distribution are among the most vital of the critical infrastructure services in modern society. While electrical grids in developed regions of the world are highly reliable, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks, extreme weather, electromagnetic pulses, and other extreme natural phenomena and malicious events. Microgrids are generally recognized as a means of increasing resiliency of electrical power. However, a specific quantitative definition of resilience and the appropriate measures of performance and effectiveness have not yet been established. Without these quantitative measures of performance and effectiveness, it is not possible to assess how much resilience a microgrid has or what enhancements or corrective actions are necessary to enable it to reach a specified level of resiliency. This paper proposes such quantitative resiliency measures, sets forth approaches for modeling and evaluating them, provides application examples, and shows they can be encapsulated within SysML models.
