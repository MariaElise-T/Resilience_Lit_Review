The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of college studentsâ€™ confirmed COVID-19, academic stress, and ego-resilience on depression. To this end, an online survey was conducted on 136 students enrolled in an university in Chungcheongnam-do. As a result of this study, there was no significant difference in academic stress, ego-resilience, and depression in the presence or absence of COVID-19 confirmation. However, students with high COVID-19 sequelae showed high levels of depression, and students who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with underlying disease showed high emotional exhaustion. As variables predicting depression, egoresilience, emotional exhaustion, and COVID-19 sequelae were found. The lower the egoresilience and the higher the emotional exhaustion, the higher the depression. After controlling for ego-resilience and academic stress, the result of examining whether COVID-19 related variables have a significant effect on depression shows that the higher the COVID-19 sequelae, the significantly higher the depression. Based on the results, several implications are discussed.
