Ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist that has gained wide attention as a potent antidepressant. It has also been recently reported to have prophylactic effects in animal models of depression and anxiety. Alterations of neuroplasticity in different brain regions; such as the hippocampus; prefrontal cortex; and amygdala; are a hallmark of stress-related disorders; and such changes may endure beyond the treatment of symptoms. The present study investigated whether a prophylactic injection of ketamine has effects on structural plasticity in the brain in mice that are subjected to chronic unpredictable stress followed by an 8-day recovery period. Ketamine administration (3 mg/kg body weight) 1 h before stress exposure increased the number of resilient animals immediately after the cessation of stress exposure and positively influenced the recovery of susceptible animals to hedonic deficits. At the end of the recovery period; ketamine-treated animals exhibited significant differences in dendritic spine density and dendritic spine morphology in brain regions associated with depression compared with saline-treated animals. These results confirm previous findings of the prophylactic effects of ketamine and provide further evidence of an association between the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine and alterations of structural plasticity in the brain
