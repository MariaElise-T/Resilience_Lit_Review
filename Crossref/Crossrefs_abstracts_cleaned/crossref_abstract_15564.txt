The growth of urbanization created new challenges for local governments to match UN sustainable goals such as being resilient and inclusive. These goals are most unlikely in informal settlements characterized by vulnerability and rejection. This study investigates the relationship between good urban governance and the resilience of informal settlements in Zanjan City, Iran, using criteria such as participation, equity, effectiveness, accountability and security as independent variables. The data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Pearson correlation test and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze the effect of the independent variable on the resilience of informal settlements in Zanjan. The results showed that all variables have a significant relationship with the dependent variable. The results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that the three variables of participation, effectiveness and accountability had a significant effect. However, the other two variables, equity and security, had a less significant effect on resilience. Five indicators of the Urban Governance Index can be used as a guiding tool for managing informal settlements.
