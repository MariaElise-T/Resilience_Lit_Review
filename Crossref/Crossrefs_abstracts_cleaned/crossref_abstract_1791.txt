Depth estimation for light field images is essential for applications such as light field image compression, reconstructing perspective views and 3D reconstruction. Previous depth map estimation approaches do not capture sharp transitions around object boundaries due to occlusions, making many of the current approaches unreliable at depth discontinuities. This is especially the case for light field images because the pixels do not exhibit photo-consistency in the presence of occlusions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to estimate the depth map for light field images using depth from defocus. Our approach uses a small patch size of pixels in each focal stack image for comparing defocus cues, allowing the algorithm to generate sharper depth boundaries. Then, in contrast to existing approaches that use defocus cues for depth estimation, we use frequency domain analysis image similarity checking to generate the depth map. Processing in the frequency domain reduces the individual pixel errors that occur while directly comparing RGB images, making the algorithm more resilient to noise. The algorithm has been evaluated on both a synthetic image dataset and real-world images in the JPEG dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques for light field images, particularly in case of noisy images.
