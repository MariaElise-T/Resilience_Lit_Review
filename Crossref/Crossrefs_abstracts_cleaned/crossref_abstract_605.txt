 This article discusses a group counseling intervention used to develop and foster resiliency in middle school students by implementing the Achieving Success Everyday (ASE) group counseling model. The authors aimed to discover what impact this group counseling intervention, which focused on resiliency characteristics, would have on studentsâ€™ academic and personal-social success. To evaluate this, the authors used both qualitative and quantitative data. The results showed that some students achieved an increase in their GPA and personal-social functioning following the intervention. The article presents implications for practice and ideas for future research.
