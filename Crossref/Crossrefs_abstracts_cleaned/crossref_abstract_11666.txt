IntroductionThis study explored the effects of coping style and two potential intermediately factors (cognitive reappraisal and psychological resilience) on the mental health of middle school students during the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China.MethodsAnswers on questionnaires designed to assess coping style, cognitive reappraisal, psychological resilience, and mental health among 743 middle school students (386 boys, 357 girls, 241 first graders, 235 second graders, and 267 third graders) were analyzed using structural equation modeling.ResultsThe results showed that coping style, cognitive reappraisal, and psychological resilience directly predicted mental health. The negative effect of a negative coping style on mental health was significantly stronger than the positive effect of a positive coping style. Coping style affected mental health through the independent mediating effects of cognitive reappraisal and psychological resilience and through their chain mediation.DiscussionThe use of positive coping styles by most students led to greater cognitive reappraisal, strengthened psychological resilience, and thus few mental health problems. These findings provide empirical evidence and may guide educators in the prevention and intervention of mental health problems among middle school students.
