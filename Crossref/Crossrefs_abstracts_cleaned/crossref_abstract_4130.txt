Abstract
Regional (economic) resilience and resilient thinking have gained considerable attention in recent years. My aim with this work is to throw light on some of the underlying aspects of regional economic resilience and resilient thinking. In the current study I give an overview of the notion, key concepts, main empirical results and planning tasks concerning regional (economic) resilience as well as outlining some of the criticisms. Finally, I provide some suggestions for studies in resilience and resilient thinking for future research agendas. The main results of the study is my own belief in the concept of regional economic resilience, and an overview and comparison of regional (economic) resilience literature and empirics that lead me to highlight some of the shortcomings of the research topic.
