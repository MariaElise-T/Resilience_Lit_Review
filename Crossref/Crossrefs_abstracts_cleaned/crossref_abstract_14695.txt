 While Latino/as are the largest racial/ethnic group in the United States, they continue to face challenges throughout their educational careers. Latino males, in particular, are said to be vanishing from higher education, earning fewer degrees than their female counterparts. Using in-depth interviews with 24 Latino male collegians, we sought to understand the process of resilience for this population, looking specifically at the factors that enhance their educational access and success within postsecondary institutions. The data demonstrate the social identities and environmental contexts that foster resilience for Latino males, despite adversities they may face. Four main themes arose, illuminating the challenges Latino males may face in their path to college and elucidating the ways they use their identities as motivation and the educational contexts that support their resilience. We highlight resilience as a process, calling for educators to consider the ways in which they can support Latino malesâ€™ aspirations into and through college.
