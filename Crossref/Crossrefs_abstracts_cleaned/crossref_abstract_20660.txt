Smart grid systems play a significant role in improving the resilience of distribution systems (DSs). In this paper, two strategies are proposed for implementation of a smart grid application: (a) a network reconfiguration and (b) a network reconfiguration with mobile emergency generator (MEGs) deployment. An improved set of resilience metrics to quantify and enhance the resiliency of distribution systems (DSs) is developed for the proposed optimization. The metrics aim to determine a suitable strategy and the optimal number and capacity of MEGs to restore the disconnected loads through the development of several microgrids. These metrics are then aggregated with the proposed strategy to develop an automated solution provider. The objective is to maximize system resilience considering the priority loads. The proposed resilience metrics are tested on the IEEE 33-Bus radial DSs. The case studies conducted proved the performance of the proposed power outage management strategy and resilience metrics in maximizing system resiliency for smart grids.
