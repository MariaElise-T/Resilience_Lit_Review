Intervening effectively with youths at risk from early deprivation, family dysfunction, poverty, abuse, and other factors is a major concern for educational and social service policymakers. Current research suggests that a majority of at‚Äêrisk youths do not experience drastic outcomes, but many exhibit protective factors that buffer them from negative consequences. Longitudinal studies from Hawaii, the continental United States, and Great Britain have identified several personality, familial, and environmental variables that promote resiliency in youths at risk. This article discusses these variables and provides counselors with an assessment technique and strategies to promote a salutogenesis perspective.
