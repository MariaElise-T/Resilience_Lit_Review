Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems (CCPS) are systems where several individual cyber-physical systems collaborate to perform a single task. The safety of a single Cyber-Physical System (CPS) can be achieved by applying a safety mechanism and following standard processes defined in ISO 26262 and IEC 61508. However, due to heterogeneity, complexity, variability, independence, self-adaptation, and dynamic nature, functional operations for CCPS can threaten system safety. In contrast to fail-safe systems, where, for instance, the system leads to a safe state when an actuator shuts down due to a fault, the system has to be fail-operational in autonomous driving cases, i.e., a shutdown of a platooning member vehicle during operation on the road is unacceptable. Instead, the vehicle should continue its operation with degraded performance until a safe state is reached or returned to its original state in case of temporal faults. Thus, this paper proposes an approach that considers the resilient behavior of collaborative systems to achieve the fail-operational goal in autonomous platooning systems. First, we extended the state transition diagram and introduced additional elements such as failures, mitigation strategies, and safe exit to achieve resilience in autonomous platooning systems. The extended state transition diagram is called the Resilient State Transition Diagram (R-STD). Second, an autonomous platooning systemâ€™s perception, communication, and ego-motion failures are modeled using the proposed R-STD to check its effectiveness. Third, VENTOS simulator is used to verify the resulting resilient transitions of R-STD in a simulation environment. Results show that a resilient state transition approach achieves the fail-operational goal in the autonomous platooning system.
