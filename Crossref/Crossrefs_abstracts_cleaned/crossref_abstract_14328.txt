This article discusses the challenges and prospects in the national textile industry. As an important industry in economic development, the textile industry needs regulatory support and strategic policies to overcome several upstream and downstream obstacles. From the upstream industry, TPT includes the fiber industry, spinning, and yarn, knitting, stamping, and finishing, while downstream, it includes the apparel industry. Through the right policies, the textile industry is expected to be able to absorb labor, support national economic growth, and realize clothing resilience. This research uses empirical juridical research methods through tracing and studying secondary data in the form of laws and regulations, academic manuscripts, policy recommendations, and scientific papers of experts in the cybersecurity and empowerment of the small and medium enterprises sector. Secondary data are obtained through Library Research from printed and electronic library materials. Doctrinal research is needed to understand the legal norms that are currently in force (Law in the Book) through a statute approach and a conceptual approach (Conceptual Approach). The results showed that some of the obstacles to the textile industry include limited transportation and electricity infrastructure, low quality of human resources, and access to financing, which is still narrow. For this reason, regulations and policies are needed to guarantee the financing of the textile industry, as well as innovation support for research institutions and related institutional cooperationâ€”notably the Indonesia Central Bank (B.I.) and Financial Services Authority.
