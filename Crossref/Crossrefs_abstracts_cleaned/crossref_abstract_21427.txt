Resilience is the ‘ability to bounce back’. We want to investigate whether measurement of resilience during an acute hospital admission is feasible. We conducted a feasibility study. Resilience was measured using the Brief Resilience Scale. Results were contextualized by measuring chronic disease burden, anxiety, depression, coping strategies and personality traits. 56 or 103 patients approached took part in the study. A group of 12 patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation served as a control group. We found evidence of low resilience in 4/44 (9%) patients admitted as medical emergencies. Low resilience was statistically related to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a number of coping strategies and personality traits. We found no relation between measures of resilience and previous admissions to hospital. The concept of resilience might be applicable to unscheduled admissions to hospital. Larger studies are required to establish whether low resilience is common and amenable to intervention. REC number 17/WA/0024.
