 The polygon effect seriously affects the running stability and safety of the vehicle. In order to suppress the wheel polygon, a dynamic model is established that can calculate the force on the resilient wheel's rim and core. With straight lines, curves, and vertical curves as input excitation, combined with wheel–rail force and acceleration, the suppression effect of the resilient wheel on the polygon is analyzed from the perspective of the time domain, frequency domain, and polygon order. The results show that the resilient wheel can effectively reduce the vertical wheel–rail force and restrain the wheel polygon. After 30 Hz, with the increase in frequency, the suppression effect of the resilient wheel on the polygon becomes increasingly significant. The resilient wheel can sufficiently suppress the polygons generated by 50–150 Hz carriage vibration without affecting the dominant frequency of carriage vibration. This study can provide a new idea for the suppression of wheel polygon.
