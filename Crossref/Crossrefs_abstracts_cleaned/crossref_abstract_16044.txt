The article presents a study of the correlation between the level of resilience among employees of the security department and the security department of the penal system. The purpose of the study was to study the resilience of employees of the security department and security department, as those most exposed to frequent interaction with special forces and being in difficult non-standard life situations. The subject of the study is the peculiarities of being in stressful situations among employees of the security department and the security department. The hypothesis of the study is the assumption that in a study of the relationship between the vitality of employees of the security department and the security department, differences will be identified. The study was carried out using diagnostic tools - S. Maddi's vitality test (adapted by D.A. Leontyev, E.I. Rasskazov). The study involved 60 respondents from selected departments, divided into two experimental groups. The results obtained during the study indicate that statistical differences were identified on the scales of “involvement”, “control” and the general level of resilience. It has been determined that security department employees have a higher level of resilience, involvement and control than security department employees. The article reflects three areas of theoretical and analytical study of the relationship between resilience and key and significant personal characteristics. The view of the researcher of the concept of “resilience” S. Maddi is also presented. The author defines three components of the studied concept: involvement, control, risk taking. The parts determine the level of resilience of an individual, that is, his ability to engage in reality, actively confront difficulties and accept emerging problems as an opportunity to realize his abilities.
