 This paper details research the authors have conducted on the relationship between resilience and spirituality. A well-being psychometric instrument is modelled, providing resilience data (attitudes towards work, perceptions of the job and general health) from a small study of police officers in a provincial force in the north of the UK. Findings highlight the significant role of leadership as a key enabler in creating a positive environment where matters of concern can be discussed openly, and which encourages employees to engage proactively in resilience enhancing behaviours. It is proposed that spirituality is an important aspect of both organisational and individual values and can be seen as a lens through which to view meaning and purpose, and as such can strongly support resilience programmes aimed at improving well-being in organisations.
