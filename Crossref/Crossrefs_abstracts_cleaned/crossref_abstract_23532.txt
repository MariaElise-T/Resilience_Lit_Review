"The research analyses the leadership styles prac ticed in the Romanian public administration, the  gender differences regarding the practiced leader ship and in terms of exhibiting behaviors that could  lead to the development of civil servants’ resilience,  trying to investigate the relation between leadership,  gender, and resilience. The paper contributes to the  scientific literature in the field by analyzing three  concepts that are not usually explored together and  especially in the public administration. The research  methodology consists of a sociological survey con ducted in the Romanian public administration where  766 civil servants agreed to participate.  The research revealed that the studied leaders  present a mix of characteristics where transforma tional and transactional behaviors are predominant.  Regarding gender differences, both men and wom en are considered to lead in a similar manner, but  a higher preference for male leaders was observed.  Men’s leadership behaviors are better appreciated,  indicating the presence of gender stereotypes and  a certain level of prejudice against women. The  studied leaders possess the necessary character istics for developing civil servants’ resilience, being  perceived as exhibiting supportive, encouraging, and  motivating attitudes when their subordinates faced  difficult moments in their careers. Also, the exis tence of a direct relation between transformational  leadership and resilience was observed."
