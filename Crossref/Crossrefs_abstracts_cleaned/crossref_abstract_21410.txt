Significance
Alternative stable states and critical transitions are widespread in nature and can have profound consequences for conservation, climate changes, and human health. Our current toolbox of early warning signals before critical transitions has seen both successes and failures. Understanding the limitations of these indicators is crucial for application in real-world scenarios. In this study, we explored the population dynamics of laboratory yeast under different forms of environmental deterioration. We found that the performance of early warning signals under different environmental drivers is determined by the underlying relation between stability and resilience. This work presents a framework to evaluate the utility of early warning signals, and it sets a foundation for further studies on how dynamical systems respond to environmental changes.
