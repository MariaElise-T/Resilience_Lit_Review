ABSTRACTSome older adults handle the pitfalls of ageing better than others. One explanation emerges from the concept of resilience, the ability to bounce back from the adversities of later life. In this study, we approached resilience from the narrative perspective. This study is a part of a project based on the DIPEx qualitative methodology, focused on different aspects of ageing. A combination of narrative and semi-structured interviews was conducted with 50 older adults (aged 75 and over). From the total number of interviews, a sub-group of 11 resilient participants was selected on the basis of the criteria set for resilience: (a) past exposure to adversity; and (b) positive adaptation to this adversity in terms of quality of life, happiness and activity. The results of the analysis are presented in the framework of five categories: (a) thematic lines, (b) agency and positioning; (c) values and beliefs; (d) reflections and perspectives; and (e) plot and genre. Both agency and reflections point to actively resisting old age as an important characteristic of resilient older adults in the Czech Republic. This resistance is often allied with irony, but we have also found genres of heroic coping and affirmation of lucky moments. Key thematic lines were love of life, emphasis on the importance of movement and positive social relationships; key values expressed by the participants were relational, existential and spiritual.
