This study aimed to explore the relationship between resilience, hope, and forgiveness and the difference between forgiveness and hope regarding sex. The result of this study with a mixed method research design precisely sequential explanatory through follow-up is to create a model that will better understand the variables being explored from a Filipino perspective. The participants of this study included 250 college students from a university and were selected through nonprobability sampling, specifically quota sampling for the quantitative part of the study, and 15 college students to answer the interview. The study used a mixed method design, specifically sequential explanatory through follow-up design. There were three instruments used in the study, namely: Herth Hope Index, Heartland Forgiveness Scale, and Wagnild and Young's Resilience Scale, and validated interview questions. The results suggest a significant relationship between hope and resilience, but there is no significant relationship between hope and forgiveness. Additionally, when compared based on sex, it was found that there is no significant difference between forgiveness and hope. In terms of thematic analysis, themes formed out of the participants' experiences in life about resilience include positivity, adaptability towards circumstances, and toughening. In terms of perception of hope by the participants, faith, desire and possibility were the themes formed. Based on the participants' responses, two types of forgiveness have been formed, which include decisional and emotional forgiveness. As a person becomes more hopeful in his or her, he or she can also be resilient in facing adversities in life. Hope can be a source of resilience. However, it is not at all times that hope can influence the likelihood of forgiving people who have offended someone. There can be other factors that can make people forgive. Hope and forgiveness do not differ in terms of sex.
