Seismic resilience is of paramount importance for the design and construction of structures in earthquake-prone regions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the seismic performance of steel-concrete composite and Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) structures under dynamic loading, facilitating a comparative assessment of their respective behaviors. The behavior of cement-concrete composite structures, emphasizing the interactions between steel and concrete components, their energy dissipation mechanisms, and their contributions to seismic resistance are explored. This review contributes to the advancement of seismic design guidelines, aiding architects, engineers, and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding safer and more resilient structures.
