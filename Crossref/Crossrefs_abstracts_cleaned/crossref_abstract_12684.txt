 Resilience could improve parental response to serving as schooling educators during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine whether schooling type (homeschool vs. public-school) and physical activity resulted in significantly different perceived resilience among 123 parents of school-aged youth. The main effect of schooling type, but not physical activity, on perceived parental resilience was significant. Homeschool parents perceived themselves as significantly more resilient than public-school parents. Public-school parents who did not meet physical activity recommendations perceived themselves as significantly less resilient than all other groups making physical activity particularly important for this demographic.
