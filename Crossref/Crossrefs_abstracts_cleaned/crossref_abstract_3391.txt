Taking the incomplete measurements and the weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol into account, this paper develops a novel resilient set-membership state estimation (RSMSE) method for time-varying nonlinear complex networks with time-invariant delay. A classic interval matrix technique is utilized to describe incomplete measurements. The Taylor series expansion is applied to dispose the nonlinearities, where the high-order terms of the linearization errors are described by norm-bounded uncertainties. To mitigate the communication burden, the WTOD protocol is introduced, where only one node can send updated data through a shared communication network at each certain transmission step. Using the recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs), a series of ellipsoidal sets including the state vector can be determined. The desirable estimator gain and a smallest possible estimation ellipsoid can be calculated via solving the convex optimization problem. Lastly, we use an illustrative example to show the feasibility of the introduced RSMSE technique.
