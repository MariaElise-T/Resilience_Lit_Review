 This study examined the cross-cultural validity of the Ego-Resilience Scale (ER89) in the Chinese cultural context. The ER89 was translated and culturally adapted into Chinese by following the psychometric validation procedures, in an adolescent sample ( N = 943) of 13- to 18-year-olds. A series of psychometric analyses were conducted, including exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), analysis for measurement invariance across gender groups, analysis for criterion-related validity evidence, and internal consistency reliability estimates. The results supported the use of ER89 scale in the Chinese cultural context (ER89-C). The empirical findings suggest a two-factor structure of ER89-C (openness to life experiences [OL] and optimal regulation [OR]). The findings also revealed that ER89-C has the expected correlations with external and theoretically related constructs. Overall, ER89-C is shown to possess favorable psychometric characteristics for its use as an assessment tool for ego-resilience level of Chinese adolescents.
