This study aims to identify and compare the objectives and elements of three emerging concepts, Health, Sustainability, and Resilience (HSR), which are proposed in this paper working together to provide a better response to the post-pandemic challenges that cities face today. This paper argues that it is possible to create sustainable, healthy, and resilient environments by reconnecting with nature through biophilic design (BD) by answering the following questions (1) What would be the common variables and elements when seeking to create a sustainable, healthy, and resilient environment and (2) How can those resultant elements be linked to biophilic design patterns to achieve solutions focused on improving peopleâ€™s health and well-being by reconnecting with nature? Consequently, this paper tries to integrate biophilic design with the healthy, sustainable, and resilient environments while comparing the variables and indicators of each concept to demonstrate that there is a common connection between them. As a result, 19 overlapping concepts are identified through the content analysis method, namely: safety, crime, risk, adaptability, environment, green, land, water, pollution, food, affordability, housing, education, transportation, planning economics, policy, community, and management. Finally, it is shown that 16 of the 19 concepts are closely related to biophilic design. In conclusion, through biophilic design, it is possible to solve the problems represented in the HSR model. For those that are not contemplated by any of the patterns, it provides an opportunity for further research.
