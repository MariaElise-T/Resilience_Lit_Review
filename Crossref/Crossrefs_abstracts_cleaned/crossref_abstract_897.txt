The Internet of Things (IoT) has been one of the main focus areas of the research community in recent years, the requirements of which help network administrators to design and ensure the functionalities and resources of each device. Generally, two types of devices—constrained and unconstrained devices—are typical in the IoT environment. Devices with limited resources—for example, sensors and actuators—are known as constrained devices. Unconstrained devices includes gateways or border routers. Such devices are challenging in terms of their deployment because of their connectivity, channel selection, multiple interfaces, local and global address assignment, address resolution, remote access, mobility, routing, border router scope and security. To deal with these services, the availability of the IoT system ensures that the desired network services are available even in the presence of denial-of-service attacks, and the use of the system has become a difficult but mandatory task for network designers. To this end, we present a novel design for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to address these challenges by shifting mandatory functionalities from unreliable to reliable and stable domains. The main contribution of our work consists in addressing the core network requirements for IoT systems and pointing out several guidelines for the design of standard virtualized protocols and functions. In addition, we propose a novel architecture which improves IoT systems, lending them more resilience and robustness, together with highlighting and some important open research topics.
