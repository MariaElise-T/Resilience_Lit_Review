 ‘Resilience’ is the capability of dealing with future shocks and stresses and continuing to function. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework for analysing and improving resilience at the neighbourhood scale, which is an effective and necessary scale at which to effect change. The important parts of this framework are the definition of the essential needs of a community, identification of future risks to a neighbourhood (climate change related and non-related) and the execution of a series of clearly defined resilience analyses of neighbourhood systems (e.g. energy system). This framework was refined by applying it to a proposed new neighbourhood development in a city in Ontario, Canada. The framework was found to be straightforward and effective in generating useful recommendations for improving neighbourhood resilience.
