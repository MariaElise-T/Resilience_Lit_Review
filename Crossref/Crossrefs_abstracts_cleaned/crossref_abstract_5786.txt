This narrative study provides new understanding about migrant farm worker families in Michigan. Mothers, in particular, are central to the family structure, providing continuity and stability in the migratory process.  In 2016, we interviewed five migrant mothers working in Harbor County, Michigan.  The women shared their struggles along with their hopes for the future.  In this article, we focus our attention on the challenges faced by the women: family obligations, sexism, limited English proficiency, limited income, and work-related demands. In addition to their accounts of difficulties, the interviews also revealed the women’s great resilience and their belief in the power of education to change the future for their children.  To conclude, we discuss the ways in which our schools and communities can support migrant students and their families.
