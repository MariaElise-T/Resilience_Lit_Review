Our environment has been experiencing changes in climate patterns in ways that were not anticipated by past designs. Coastal engineers are increasing at the center of complex multidisciplinary projects. With changing climate, rising sea levels, and growing coastal population centers, coastal engineers are key players in developing solutions for both built infrastructure and natural systems. This presentation will discuss the challenges to coastal engineering and examine some coastal resiliency approaches on recent projects and experiences in the United States.Recorded Presentation from the vICCE (YouTube Link): https://youtu.be/prjG4LTU-iU
