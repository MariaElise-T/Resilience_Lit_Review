The aim of this study is to determine whether the resilience levels and mathematics and science process skills of 5-year-old preschoolers vary significantly based on independent variables (gender, number of siblings, education level of the mother, education level of the father, and family income level) and to detect the correlations between them. The sample of the study consisted of 384 children. "Child Information Form, Risk Factors List, Early Childhood Resilience Scale, Early Childhood Mathematics Education Content Standards Scale, and Science Observation Form" were used as data collection tools. In the study, it was determined that there was a significant difference between the resilience levels of children and gender, education level of the father, and family income level. A significant difference was observed between the mathematical skills of the children and the number of siblings, parental education level, and family income level. Also, a significant difference was determined between the science process skill levels of the children and the number of siblings, family income level, and father's education level. There was a moderate positive correlation between resilience and mathematical skills and a high positive correlation between resilience and science process skills. In addition, it was concluded that the resilience levels of children were a significant predictor of their mathematics and science process skill levels.
