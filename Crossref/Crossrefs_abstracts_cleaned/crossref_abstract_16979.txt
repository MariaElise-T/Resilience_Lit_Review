Urban resilience and urbanization have been researched wildly by urban researchers. The coupling relationship between the level of urban resilience and urbanization is a considerable reference to assess the quality of urban development. Based on the correlation of objective index data, it theoretically explains whether the urban resilience level is coupled with the urbanization level and the degree of coupling, providing advice and wisdom for the future high-quality urban development of Hefei. Objective. To explore whether there is coupling between the urbanization level and the urban resilience level and to explore what extent of the coupling is. Research Methods. The dimensionless method was mainly used to standardize the original statistical data, the entropy method can be chosen to obtain the weight of the indexes of urbanization level and urban resilience level, and the coupling coordination model was chosen to study the degree of coupling coordination. Research conclusions. From 2011 to 2013, the coupling coordinate on degree was low. The coupling coordination level of urbanization and urban resilience was moderately unbalanced in 2011, mild disorder in 2012, and primary coordination in 2013. However, in 2014 and 2015, the situation improved a lot, and the coordination degree was intermediate coordination. From 2016 to 2019, the coupling coordination degree was in the stage of advanced coordination.
