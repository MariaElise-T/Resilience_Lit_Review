AbstractPurposeThe conflict in Palestine is known to be one of the longest ongoing conflicts in the world affecting children with harmful psychological consequences. The purpose of this study was to explore the process of resilience among Palestinian children exposed to psychological trauma due to detention experiences.MethodA qualitative approach utilizing grounded theory design was used. Data collected by a semi‐structured interview format from 18 Palestinian children aged 12–18 years were exposed to detention.ResultsThe study revealed four main categories with focus and initial coding subcategories. Major categories were: revering and honoring the prisoners, normalizing the abnormal situations (positive adaptation), awareness and political socialization during childhood, and developing identity and belonging to the homeland. The results indicated that Palestinian children exposed to political detention had their own positive perception of the trauma and had a high level of posttraumatic maturation.Practice ImplicationThe study concluded that early childhood political awareness, family and community support, sociocultural perception of prisoner children, and sense of belonging improved the ability of detained children to normalize abnormal situations and successfully cope with psychological trauma. So, the study has significant implications for nursing practice in the field of childhood trauma and intervention, it can help nurses working with traumatized children to assess and intervene according to the child's perception about the trauma and ability to cope.
