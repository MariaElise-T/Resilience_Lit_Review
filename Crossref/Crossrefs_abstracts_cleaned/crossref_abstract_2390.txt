<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to classify the definitions and approaches towards the concept of the city of resilience, to understand the reciprocal influences of academic research, resilience assessments and planning results as well as to identify the inconsistencies and formulate future research directions.</p><p><strong>Methodology/Approach:</strong> explanatory analysis, literature-based work comparing definitions, principles, dimensions. Rationalised analytic reasoning and approaches which lead to formulating crucial research questions.</p><p><strong>Findings:</strong> the definitions of city resilience are classified according to objects and fields. The differentiations in the sustainability and resilience concepts are indicated and an adaptive planning framework is described.</p><p><strong>Research Limitation/implication:</strong> the main challenges are filling in the gap between the theory and practice of city resilience literature, dealing with the complexity, the implementation of complexity theory considering self-organisation.</p><p><strong>Originality/Value of paper:</strong> the analysis contributes to the clarification of the main concept, classification of the main approaches and the formulation of open research questions and future trends.</p>
