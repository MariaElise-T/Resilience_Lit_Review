The main purpose of this paper is to contribute to building Resilient Organization issues. The author discusses a psychological approach to resilience, from Robert Jay Lifton’s to Martin Seligman’s conceptual perspectives. The main objective of the paper is to discuss the chance of using so-called character strengths as a useful tool in resilience-oriented training courses dedicated to managers of various types of organizations. The author has conducted a workshop on “character strengths in the workplace”. The empirical basis for the mentioned workshop is qualitative, narrative research which was carried out a few years back. This initial result of the study reveals some of the examples of collective categories in which two groups of managers (from public administration and sales industry) foresee a possibility of using character strengths in the optimization of managerial work tasks.
