The article explains the necessity to adapt the theory of regional resilience in Russia’s
domestic science, considering the existing Western concepts, and determines the prerequisites for the formation of the theory of resilience of regional economic systems
in Russian science. The definitions of the concept of “resilience” from different fields
of knowledge and their interpretation in the field of regional economy and economic
geography are given. The conceptual bases of evolutionary accounting of regional economic stability and adaptation are also considered, and the basic properties and factors influencing regional stability are determined. The notion of “resilience” is very important for understanding the process and models of uneven regional development, but the critically broad interpretation of this concept is a significant obstacle in building theoretical foundations and developing appropriate public policy measures. The authors
identify the main factors affecting the resilience of the regional economic system: the
ability of the region’s economy to adapt to changing economic conditions and to overcome crisis recessions; the availability of modern infrastructure, skilled personnel and business entities; a diversified economy; a strong system of innovation and research; a stable financial system; demographic trends; regional policy etc. The authors conclude that there is no single equilibrium state of the economy: crisis and shock situations shift the economy from its equilibrium path, after which it either restores its former growth path, or goes to the underlying trajectory or to an improved path of growth.
