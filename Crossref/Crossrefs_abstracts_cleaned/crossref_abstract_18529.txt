Objective: To evaluate the effects of cognitive behavioral and psychological intervention(CBPI) on social adaptation, psychological resilience, and the level of hope in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC) in radiotherapy.
Methods: This is application research. Eighty patients undergoing radiotherapy for NPC at Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University from November 20, 2020 to November 15, 2022 were randomized into control and study groups at a 1:1 ratio. While the control group was provided with standard specialized nursing care, the study group was offered CBPI in addition to the exact nursing care. Differences in quality of life, psychological resilience, level of hope, emotional state, and patient satisfaction between the groups were compared and analyzed before and after treatment.
Results: After an intervention, significantly improved physical, mental, and social functions and material living conditions were observed in the study group compared with the control group (all p< 0.05). Although both groups scored higher on the selected psychological resilience scale following the intervention, the study group showed better results as compared to control group in adaptability, tenacity, control, and goal orientation (all p< 0.05). While both groups had elevated scores of temporality and future, interconnectedness, and positive readiness and expectancy at the end of the intervention, the improvements were more pronounced in the study group (all p< 0.05).
Conclusion: CBPI supports radiotherapy for NPC by improving patients’ quality of life, confidence in treatment, the hope of recovery, psychological resilience, anxiety, depression, and patient satisfaction. Therefore, this treatment strategy is worthy of wide application in clinical settings.
