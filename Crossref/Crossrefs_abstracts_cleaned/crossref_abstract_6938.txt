Research increasingly suggests that climate change has intensified the frequency of droughts, floods, and other environmental disasters across sub-Saharan Africa. In response to the resulting array of climate-induced challenges, various stakeholders are working collectively to build climate resilience in rural and urban communities and trans-continentally. This paper examines key climate resilience-building projects that have been implemented across sub-Saharan Africa through multi-stakeholder partnerships. It uses a vulnerabilities assessment approach to examine the strategic value of these projects in managing the mitigation of climate shocks and long-term environmental changes. There are still many challenges to building climate resilience in the region, but through multi-stakeholder partnerships, sub-Saharan African nations are expanding their capacity to pool resources and build collective action aimed at financing and scaling up innovative climate solutions. This article contributes to ongoing interdisciplinary academic, management, and policy discourses on global climate adaptation focused on populations and landscapes most at risk.
