Many high-strength hydrogels have been developed in recent years; however, few of them are both tough and resilient, and their intrinsic paradoxical nature makes designing a gel with both high toughness and high resilience a great challenge. To address this problem, we introduced both N,N,N,N-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PA) and N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) into polyacrylamide hydrogel networks to construct an entangled network that contains chemically cross-linked chains and branched chains simultaneously. The entanglements of branched chains can act as a physical cross-linking point to uniformly disperse stress on molecular chains, and chemical cross-linking ensures the stability of the hydrogel network. The increase in the number and length of branched chains is able to achieve an enhancement in strength while the slip of the entangled polymer chains can effectively achieve energy dissipation and can improve the toughness of the gel. Moreover, the resultant hydrogels exhibit an excellent resilience (>98%). Therefore, high toughness and resilience are achieved simultaneously. In addition, we also investigated the initiation mechanism of PA. This strategy creates a new way for the preparation of next-generation high toughness and high resilience hydrogel-based materials, which have promising applications in wearable, flexible strain/pressure sensors.
