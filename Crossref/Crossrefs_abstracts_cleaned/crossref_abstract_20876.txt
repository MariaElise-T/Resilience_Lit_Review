AbstractMeasurement of resilience is important within schools to support student mental health and well‐being. Resilience is defined as the healthy integration, adaptation, and positive functioning over time in response to the experience of adversity and challenge. This study explored the relationship between a subjective and objective measure of resilience and the respective predictability of psychophysical well‐being measures. A sample of 282 Year 10 students completed a subjective resilience measure (Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale) and psychological measures of well‐being. A subset of 76 students completed an objective measure of resilience (heart rate variability [HRV]). Correlational analyses revealed no significant relationship between the two measures and do not support the use of one measure as a proxy for the other. Hierarchical regression analyses illustrated the significant predictive quality of the subjective measure to psychophysical well‐being measures. The strongest relationships were reported with EPOCH subscales Optimism (r = 0.68), Happiness (r = 0.64), and Perseverance (r = 0.59). No significant relationships were found between the objective resilience measure and well‐being measures. With objective resilience showing no relationship to subjective resilience and well‐being, it is possible that HRV instead measures the capacity for resilience, rather than resilience. This study highlights the importance of defining resilience and the implications for measurement in adolescent students.
