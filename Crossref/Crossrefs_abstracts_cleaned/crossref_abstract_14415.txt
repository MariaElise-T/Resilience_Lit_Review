AbstractResilience is a very useful construct for framing school mental health services to children and is particularly applicable to mental health services in school settings. Still, resilience perspectives should not be overgeneralized to school mental health practice because risk and resilience wax and wane over time and daily decisions about students' needs for support must remain flexible and responsive to these changes. This article describes shifts and changes in early indicators of school success for third‐ through fifth‐grade students in a Midwestern elementary school as one example of the power and limitations of resilience models' applicability. The example is used to argue for caution in interpreting early indicators of risk as predicting subsequent poor student outcomes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
