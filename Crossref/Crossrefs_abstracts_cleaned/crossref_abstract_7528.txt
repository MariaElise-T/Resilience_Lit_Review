Gender-based violence is considered a serious social and public health problem. Overcoming this situation implies a process that results in the favorable biopsychosocial rehabilitation of the resilience of women. The objective of this study was to analyze the tools, resources and personal and psychosocial mechanisms used by women survivors of gender-based violence. The design was an interpretative phenomenology. It was carried out with 22 women who have overcome gender-based violence. Data were collected through personal interviews and narration. The results were grouped into four themes: “Process of violence”, “Social resources for coping and overcoming GBV”, “Personal tools for coping and overcoming GBV” and “Feelings identified, from the abuse stage to the survival stage”. Several studies concluded that overcoming abuse is influenced by the women’s social network, and it can be the action of these people determining their survival to gender violence. Despite the recognized usefulness of these available resources, it would be desirable to strengthen them in order to be able to drive more women toward survival, assuming a strengthening of coping and overcoming, without forgetting the importance of other support mechanisms, such as their family and group therapies.
