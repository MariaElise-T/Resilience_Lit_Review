Article is devoted to development of design and methodic of projecting the new type of resilient member, generated out of composite material. The construction, its schemes of loading, the result of optical and FEM modeling of elastic element, the results of experiences with the designed samples of elastic elements attached. On the basis of the given investigations the authors made the conclusions and recommendations for receiving the demanded characteristics of rigidity during homogeneous mode of deformation-stress of element. The example of design of suspension bracket with use of new type elastics element, created from composite material is resulted.
