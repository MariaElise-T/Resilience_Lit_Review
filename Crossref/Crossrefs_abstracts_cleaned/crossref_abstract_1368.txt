Introdution: The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and hope therapy on quality of life, life expectancy, resiliency in patients with thalassemia who went to Bushehr Thalassemia Therapy Center in 2017.
Methods: The study was experimental and census was used. It consisted of 21 patients with thalassemia in Bushehr province who were randomly divided into two experimental groups of cognitive-behavioral therapy and hope therapy and one control group. To conduct the research, World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, Life Expectancy Questionnaire by Schneider and Connorâ€“Davidson Resilience Scale were used. All the patients completed the questionnaires before and after the intervention. In order to analyze data, analysis of covariance was performed.
Results: In the therapy group, the majority of the patients were female, single and held a bachelor's degree. Similarly, in the control group, the highest proportion belonged to females and married patients, whereas a minority held a bachelor's degree. Compared with the control group, the findings of analysis of covariance revealed that both cognitive-behavioral therapy and hope therapy were significantly effective (p-value<0.05). Cognitive-behavioral therapy significantly increased quality of life, life expectancy and resiliency (37%), (14%) and (20%), respectively. Also, hope therapy significantly increased quality of life, life expectancy and resiliency (98%), (29%) and (11%), respectively. The findings showed that hope therapy was more effective than cognitive-behavioral therapy in increasing quality of life, life expectancy and resiliency.
Conclusion: The results indicated that cognitive-behavioral therapy and hope therapy were effective in enhancing the quality of life, life expectancy and resiliency in the patients with thalassemia. Hence, considering psychological interventions, in addition to physical therapies, is of particular importance.
