We share Britt, Shen, Sinclair, Grossman, and Klieger's (2016) concern over the confusion of the conceptual definition of resilience and believe that this thorny issue should be solved. Hence, our objective in this commentary is to dispel to some extent the fuzzy state of the resilience construct content, building on the extant resilience literature. This will help to enhance resilience construct validity.
