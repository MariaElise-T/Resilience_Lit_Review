Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, various measures have been taken in Turkey to protect community health. All schools in Turkey have been closed since 16 March 2020. The normalisation process started along with the decrease in the number of cases in summer, and childrenâ€™s lockdown was abolished on 10 June 2020. Rearising of cases as from August delayed the planned opening of the 2020-2021 academic year fall term. Thus, the Ministry of National Education, which is among the institutions taking new measures related to the process, created a stage-by-stage transition plan, in which face-to-face education and distance education are carried out in cooperation, for the opening of schools. Main goal of the study was to examine the ego-resiliency levels of the children between the ages of five and six years according to age and gender variables during the COVID-19 period. The study group consisted of 223 children from the age group of five and six years. As a result of the study, it was found that girls had higher resiliency levels than their boys peers. Another finding was that there was no significant difference in the resiliency levels of the children between the ages of five and six years.
