AbstractIn this article, the resilient control for networked control systems in the presence of denial‐of‐service (DoS) attacks is investigated in a sampled‐data and dynamic quantization scheme. A novel dynamic quantization strategy is designed for signal transmissions from encoding systems to decoding systems, in which the quantized states are transmitted through networks with a risk of DoS attacks. An estimator is introduced to the design of control laws. Some sufficient conditions in terms of quantization levels, DoS attack duration and frequencies are given for the asymptotic stability of networked control systems. Furthermore, an event‐triggered communication scheme is designed for signal transmissions in control channels to reduce network resource consumption. The Zeno behavior is excluded in the designed event‐triggered communication scheme. The quantization levels can be adaptively adjusted according to real‐time situations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated by simulations.
