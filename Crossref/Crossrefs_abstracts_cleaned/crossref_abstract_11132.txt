Intensification of globalization processes, social-political and financial and economic instability, the desire of Eastern European countries to integrate into the European Union raise the issue of sustainable development, in which public governance is of great importance. Ensuring effective and sustainable public governance is one of the priority areas of sustainable development of the state. The purpose of the research lies in substantiating the theoretical and applied principles of studying the institutional resilience of public governance and assessing the impact of public governance on ensuring sustainable development. General and special methods of economic analysis have been used in the research, in particular as follows: analysis and synthesis, comparisons and analogies, generalization and systematization, grouping and cluster analysis based on the use of k-means method, and graphical method. The results of studying the impact of public governance stability on sustainable development have revealed that the institutional resilience of public governance significantly affects sustainable development. Exploring the impact of the institutional resilience of public governance on ensuring sustainable development of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, three groups of countries have been identified that have common features of public governance and sustainable development, namely: countries with a relatively high level of institutional resilience of public governance and sustainable development (Hungary (GSDGI: 75,00 - 78,78), Poland (GSDGI: 73,70 - 80,22), the Czech Republic (GSDGI: 78,70 - 81,39), Slovakia (GSDGI: 75,60 - 79,57), in which the basic principles of institutional resilience of public governance and sustainable development are implemented at a sufficiently high level; countries with a moderate (intermediate) level of institutional resilience of public governance and sustainable development (Moldova (GSDGI: 73,68 - 74,50), Ukraine (GSDGI: 72,30 - 75,51), Belarus (GSDGI: 76,00 - 78,82), which make significant efforts to ensure an effective system of public governance and sustainable development indicators; countries with a low level of institutional resilience of public governance and sustainable development (Azerbaijan (GSDGI: 70,50 - 73,68), Armenia (GSDGI: 68,80 â€“ 71,79), Georgia (GSDGI: 68,90 - 72,23), in which significant destabilizing factors are revealed to ensure the institutional resilience of public governance and sustainable development.
