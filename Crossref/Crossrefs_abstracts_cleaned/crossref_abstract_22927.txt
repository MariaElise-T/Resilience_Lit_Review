<p>The study is aimed at identifying gender characteristics of the connection between resilience and subjective well-being and the migration attitudes of Siberian schoolchildren. The survey involved students of secondary educational institutions in Omsk and Omsk Region (N=461), from 14 to 17 years old (15.5, SD=1.39), 268 (58.1%) girls, 193 (41.9%) boys. Methods of testing and questioning, expert interviews were applied. Research methods: S. Maddy's Hardiness Test adapted by D.A. Leontiev, E.I. Rasskazova; Method of Diagnosing the Subjective Well-being of the Individual by R.M. Shamionov, T.V. Beskova; the Scale of Migratory Attitudes of Personality by S.A. Kuznetsova; the author's questionnaire, which included questions about the socio-demographic characteristics of schoolchildren, their intellectual activity. The obtained results testify to the existence of a connection between hardiness and subjective well-being with the migratory attitudes of intellectually gifted and motivated girls. At the same time, the migratory attitudes of young men are practically not connected with the above-mentioned constructs, regardless of their level of giftedness and activity. In the group of gifted girls, a decrease in hardiness, in particular, control and involvement, as well as subjective, in particular, emotional and ego well-being, leads to an increase in migratory attitudes. In the group of motivated girls, in a similar way, attitudes about migration are associated with control and involvement, subjective well-being. The conclusion is made about the differentiated connection of gender and giftedness with the migration attitudes of schoolchildren, its mediation by the level of their resilience and well-being.</p>
