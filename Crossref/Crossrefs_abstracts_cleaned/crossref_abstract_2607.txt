AbstractUntil now the discussion on resilience has mainly adopted technical, economic, functional points of view. This paper assumes that, even though these approaches are important and necessary, they are not enough. If resilience must be a characterizing feature of every potential future society, its cultural dimension must be considered too. In order to make a contribution in this direction, the paper introduces the notions of distributed systems and cosmopolitan localism and discusses the possibility of using design tools to connect and reinforce them. It also observes that both distributed systems and cosmopolitan localism can be recognized in the growing wave of social innovations we are witnessing worldwide. Building on them, the paper concludes outlining an emerging design scenario, the SLOC scenario, and the new cultural fabric needed to implement it.
