Abstract
While academic resilience has been a hot topic in positive psychology, there is still scope for researchers to explore it in the field of applied linguistics. Drawing on the framework of L2 (second language) learners’ resilience proposed by T. Y. Kim and Y. K. Kim (2017), the current study aims to examine senior high school students’ English academic resilience (EAR) and its relationship to their English achievement (EA). This study comprises a survey of 454 senior high school students. Follow-up interviews were carried out to triangulate the quantitative findings. The descriptive results demonstrate that students’ EAR is above the average, and its five subscales obtain medium to medium-higher levels due to the mean scores. It shows that students have good EAR that enables them to deal with academic adversity. The correlational analysis shows a low positive correlation between EAR and EA in general, and the subscales share medium to low correlations with students’ EA. EAR has a certain influence on EA, but the correlation may be influenced by other learner variables. Based on the results, suggestions on improving students’ EAR are provided.
