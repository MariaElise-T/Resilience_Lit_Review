AbstractIncreasing frequency of climate-related disruptions requires transformational responses over the lifecycles of interconnected urban systems with short- and long-term change dynamics. However, the aftermath of disruptions is often characterised by short-sighted decision-making, neglecting long-term urban shifts. In this study, we present a first attempt to develop the theoretical foundation for temporal dynamics for increasingly disrupted yet ”connecting and moving” cities that can be used in planning for urban resilience. Using the lens of climate urbanism, we conceptualise the interplay of temporal dynamics to empirically examine how planning practice perceives and addresses temporality in two regions - Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Mumbai, India. Our findings reinforce that disruptions do not inform long-term planning. Endogenous and exogenous dynamics of change are not viewed together nor used to embed short-term planning goals within long-term resilience visions. To address the lack of systematic planning approaches that can leverage temporal dynamics, we propose two options for temporally flexible urban planning processes.
