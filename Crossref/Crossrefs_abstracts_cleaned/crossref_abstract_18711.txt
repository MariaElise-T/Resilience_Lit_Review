Background: Resilience, an individual’s ability to cope with and recover from stressors, is supported by contextually specific factors. Factors in the work environment may support or hinder nurses’ resilience to the specific stressors present in pediatric nursing, an understudied population. Objective: We aimed to explore the contextual factors in the work environment of pediatric nurses with varying levels of resilience, including social support, the work environment, and opportunities for coping from an individual approach. Methods: This study is a secondary mixed-methods analysis using ordinal logistic regression and a meta-matrix of survey responses and semi-structured interview transcripts from 30 pediatric nurses. Results: 5 themes, 3 supporting and 2 hindering resilience, emerged from the interviews. Nurses described their resilience as supported by sharing the burden, support from administration, and taking a break. Participants described resilience as hindered when they found it challenging to provide quality nursing care and when they felt unappreciated or undervalued. No theme significantly changed the odds of having higher resilience. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nurses recognize resources and conditions within their work environment as influencing their resilience. However, workplace resources and conditions are only one contributor to pediatric nurse resilience. Encouraging breaks and informal opportunities for nurses to support each other may support resilience in pediatric nurses. In addition, nursing leaders can support pediatric nurse resilience by regularly spending time connecting with nurses. Finally, health care organizations should consider how changes in the work environment may hinder nurse resilience by adding stress or changing access to supportive factors.
