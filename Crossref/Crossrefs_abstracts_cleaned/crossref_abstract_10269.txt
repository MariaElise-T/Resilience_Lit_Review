To scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the current city safety resilience and improve the city safety resilience level, this project puts forward the concept and degree of city safety resilience based on the systematic analysis of the city safety resilience curve and establishes the framework of a city safety resilience evaluation index system, including predisaster prevention, disaster-bearing carrier, emergencies and emergency management. The Delphi method and cloud model are used to construct the city safety resilience evaluation model, and the weight and application of the model are analyzed and discussed. The research results show that the theory and method of Chinese city safety resilience evaluation based on the Delphi method and cloud model have important guiding significance for improving the city safety resilience level.
