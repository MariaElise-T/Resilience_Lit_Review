AbstractMuch is known about how experiences of community violence negatively affect youth, but far less research has explored how youth remain resilient while living in dangerous neighborhoods. This study addresses this need by analyzing in‐depth, geo‐narrative interviews conducted with 15 youth (60% Black, 27% Latinx, 53% female, 14 to 17 years old) residing in low‐income, high‐crime Chicago neighborhoods to explore youths’ perceptions of safety and strategies for navigating neighborhood space. After carrying geographical positioning system (GPS) trackers for an eight‐day period, youths’ travel patterns were mapped, and these maps were used as part of an interview with youth that explored daily routines, with special consideration paid to where and when youth felt safe. Drawing on activity settings theory and exploring youth voice, we find that experiences of community violence are commonplace, but youth describe how they have safe spaces that are embedded within these dangerous contexts. Perceptions of safety and danger were related to environmental, social, and temporal cues. Youth reported four overarching safety strategies, including avoidance, hypervigilance, self‐defense, and emotional management, but these strategies considerably varied by gender. We discuss implications for practice and future directions of research.Highlights

This study explored Chicago youths' safety strategies and resilience in high‐crime neighborhoods.
Safe and dangerous spaces are embedded or overlapping settings.
All youth practiced safety strategies but they considerably varied by gender.
Perceptions are intersubjectively created due to the codes, rules, and norms of community life.
Violence is common and extreme in everyday life of this sample of Chicago adolescents.
