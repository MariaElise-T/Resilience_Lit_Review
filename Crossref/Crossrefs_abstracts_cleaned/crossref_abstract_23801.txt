This study investigated the effects of individualism-collectivism, sociotropy-autonomy, and resilience on alienation, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. A total of 646 participants (aged 20 - 74) took part in the online survey (December 6, 2020 - January 24, 2021). Resilience was the most powerful predictor of alienation, anxiety, and depression. Anxiety, depression, and comorbid groups were 28.9%, 44.9%, 25.1% respectively. Significant predictors of anxiety were female (OR = 1.95), income (OR = .86), sociotropy (OR = 2.10), autonomy (OR = 2.04), resilience (OR = .25) and alienation (OR = 2.34). Female (OR = 2.40), vertical individualism (OR = 1.41), sociotropy (OR = 1.99), resilience (OR = .21), and alienation (OR = 5.01) were significant predictors of depression. To alleviate anxiety and depression during COVID-19, it is important to reduce alienation and increase resilience.
