Economics and engineering manage the built infrastructure in a dynamic equilibrium of supply and demand. The potentially contradictory constraints of the two domains within their governing dimensions of money and energy are explored. An analogy is drawn between mechanical and infrastructure network stability. The recently popularized terms of robustness, resilience and sustainability are defined as critical descriptors of the process and product to be jointly optimized by the two fields.
