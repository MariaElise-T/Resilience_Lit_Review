Abstract
Resilient buildings have become a widely researched topic in the engineering discipline. A building has enabled connectivity between building systems, including air conditioning, ventilation, safety and security system. They are even more important with growing pandemic risks and the spread of airborne viruses such as Covid-19. The literature indicates that nanotechnology applications can have a great role in the designing resilient office buildings. Nanotechnologies play a major role in architectural design; building materials combined with nanotechnology became smaller, lighter, and more efficient than conventional materials. Thus, this research aims to develop design guidelines for resilient office buildings in Egypt using nanotechnology applications. The methodology applied includes a review on nanotechnology and resilient office buildings key design features, following a simulation using design builder program where conducted to modify the nanomaterials in resilient office buildings recorded through quantified data. After applying the nanotechnology concept on walls, the roof and glazing types by inserting nanomaterials. The research concluded that the use of vacuum insulation panel, Nano-gel glass and Nano-painting had the highest impact on decreasing the total energy consumption by 14.5% and carbon dioxide emissions by 42%.
