Psychological flexibility is an important psychological factor influencing various individual and relational outcomes. However, there is a scarcity of evidence about cross-culturally validated measures available. The aim of the present study was to assess the Turkish validation of the Psy-Flex Scale, which is a new and recently developed measure of this construct and test its relationship with resilience and social support. The sample comprised 516 adults (52.3% males) with an age range of 18â€“60 years (M = 27.08, SD = 8.53). Results showed that the measure had good construct validity with high internal consistency reliability. The findings also demonstrated that psychological flexibility was positively associated with resilience and social support. Additionally, social support partially mediated the relationship between resilience and psychological flexibility. These results suggest that the Psy-Flex Scale is a reliable and valid tool to measure psychological flexibility in the Turkish cultural context. Intervention programs focusing on social support can also be tailored to promote psychological flexibility by cultivating resilience.
