 The resilient modulus measured in the indirect tensile mode according to ASTM D 4123 reflects effectively the elastic properties of asphalt mixtures under repeated load. The coarse aggregate morphology quantified by angularity and surface texture properties affects resilient modulus of asphalt mixes; however, the relationship is not yet well understood because of the lack of quantitative measurement of coarse aggregate morphology. This paper presents findings of a laboratory study aimed at investigating the effects of the material properties of the major component on the resilient modulus of asphalt mixes, with the coarse aggregate morphology considered as the principal factor. With modulus tests performed at a temperature of 25Â°C, using coarse aggregates with more irregular morphologies substantially improved the resilient modulus of asphalt mixtures. An imaging-based angularity index was found to be more closely related to the resilient modulus than an imaging-based surface texture index, as indicated by a higher value of the correlation coefficient. The stiffness of the asphalt binder also had a strong influence on modulus. When the resilient modulus data were grouped on the basis of binder stiffnesses, the agreement between the coarse aggregate morphology and the resilient modulus was significantly improved in each group. Although the changes in aggregate gradation did not significantly affect the relationship between the coarse aggregate morphology and the resilient modulus, decreasing the nominal maximum aggregate size from 19 mm to 9.5 mm indicated an increasing positive influence of aggregate morphology on the resilient modulus of asphalt mixes.
