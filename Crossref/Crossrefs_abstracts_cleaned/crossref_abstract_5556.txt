The purpose of the present
research was to examine the relationships between career adaptability (CA),
career optimism (CO), resilience and self-esteem. A hierarchical regression
analysis was specified to determine whether career adaptability and optimism
predicted by resilience and self-esteem components. The participants in the
research group were 39 males and 138 females with an age range of 21â€“30 years
old (M = 22.26). The 150 of the participants were senior college students and
27 of participants were teachers in an exam preparation course. As a result of
this study, it was seen that there was no gender difference in terms of career adaptability.
However, when the career optimism is examined, it is seen that women draw a
more positive picture than men. When the factors affecting career adaptability
and career optimism are examined, psychological resilience, self-liking and
self-competence behavior are defined as factors affecting career adaptability.
However, only self-competence is seen to be effective on career optimism.
