AbstractAotearoa New Zealand feminist geographies involve alliances of connected and vibrant researchers who pay close attention to the politics of knowledge production, power, intersectionality and decolonisation. Safe spaces to speak and write together have been nurtured over time ‘down under’ due to a collective politics of care and mentoring. This special issue demonstrates the strength of collective thinking on resistance, resilience and reworking contemporary geographical practice in Aotearoa. The four empirically based and theoretically informed articles develop new thinking about resistance to colonialism, patriarchy, racism, metricisation and oppression. These critical articles contribute to feminist geographical knowledges both locally and globally.
