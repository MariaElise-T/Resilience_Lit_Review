Background: Higher patient resilience has been shown to be associated with improved patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 6 months after hip arthroscopy. Purpose: To examine the relationship between patient resilience and PROMs at minimum 2 years after hip arthroscopy. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Included were 89 patients (mean age, 36.9 years; mean follow-up, 4.6 years). Patient demographics, surgical details, and preoperative International Hip Outcome Tool-12 (iHOT-12) and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were collected retrospectively. Postoperative variables were collected via a survey and included the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Patient Activation Measure–13 (PAM-13), Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire–2 (PSEQ-2), VAS satisfaction, and postoperative iHOT-12, and VAS pain scores. Based on the number of standard deviations from the mean BRS score, patients were stratified as having low resilience (LR; n = 18), normal resilience (NR; n = 48), and high resilience (HR; n = 23). Differences in PROMs were compared between the groups, and a multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between pre- to postoperative change (Δ) in PROMs and patient resilience. Results: There were significantly more smokers in the LR group compared with the NR and HR groups ( P = .033). Compared with the NR and HR groups, patients in the LR group had significantly more labral repairs ( P = .006), significantly worse postoperative iHOT-12, VAS pain, VAS satisfaction, PAM-13, and PSEQ-2 scores ( P < .001 for all), and significantly lower ΔVAS pain and ΔiHOT-12 scores ( P = .01 and .032, respectively). Regression analysis showed significant associations between ΔVAS pain and NR (β = -22.50 [95% CI, -38.81 to -6.19]; P = .008) as well as HR (β = -28.31 [95% CI, -46.96 to -9.67; P = .004) and between ΔiHOT-12 and NR (β = 18.94 [95% CI, 6.33 to 31.55]; P = .004) as well as HR (β = 20.63 [95% CI, 6.21 to 35.05]; P = .006). Male sex was a significant predictor of ΔiHOT-12 (β = -15.05 [95% CI, -25.42 to -4.69]; P = .006). Conclusion: The study results indicate that lower postoperative resilience scores were associated with significantly worse PROM scores, including pain and satisfaction, at 2 years after hip arthroscopy.
