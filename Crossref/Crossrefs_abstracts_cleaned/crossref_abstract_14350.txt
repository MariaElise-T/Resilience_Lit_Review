            The aim of the current study was to investigate the moderating effects of resilience on the relationship between emotional labor and burnout among care workers in long-term care (LTC) hospitals. Participants were 126 care workers from five different LTC hospitals in Busan, South Korea. A set of self-reported questionnaires was administered to assess general characteristics, emotional labor, resilience, and burnout of participants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics,
            t
            tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficients, and hierarchical multiple regression. The final multivariate regression model was statistically significant and accounted for 36% of the variance in burnout. Emotional labor was significantly associated with burn-out (β = 0.25,
            p
            = 0.001). Resilience had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between emotional labor and burnout (β = −0.16,
            p
            = 0.033). To alleviate burnout in care workers, emotional labor should be recognized as a significant mental health problem and management interventions should be developed. [
