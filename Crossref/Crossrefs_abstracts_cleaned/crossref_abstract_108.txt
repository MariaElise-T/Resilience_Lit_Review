AbstractIt is well‐recognized that nurses are exposed to high levels of stress, thus resilience has been postulated as a key trait in enabling nurses to cope successfully and remain in the profession. In this qualitative study, we used Glaser's approach to grounded theory. Nine nurses who scored low and nine nurses who scored high on the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale were recruited for one‐on‐one semistructured interviews of the factors contributing to their work‐related stress and how they overcome these stressors. Three categories emerged from the data: outlook on work, self‐efficacy, and coping responses. These categories led to the emergence of the theory “differing pathways to resiliency”. Despite the stresses experienced at work, some nurses were highly resilient, while others were not. Highly‐resilient nurses tend to adopt active coping mechanisms, whereas nurses who have low resilience tend to undertake passive measures to let nature runs its course. The emerging theory provided an understanding of the different pathways to resiliency and how nurse leaders can potentially develop and grow the level of resiliency among nurses.
