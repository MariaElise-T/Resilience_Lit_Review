The influence of psychological resilience inherent in an individual on psychological well-being becomes apparent in extreme and crisis situations. The quality of coping and the speed of recovery after experienced psychological trauma are considered as criterial indicators. Against the background of a large number of theoretical and empirical studies of the structure and components of psychological resilience, the scientific problem of the formation and development of this phenomenon in ontogenesis becomes obvious. To date, the study of the genesis of psychological resilience occurs simultaneously within two paradigms – the natural sciences and the humanities. Polymorphisms of the SLC6A4, SLC6A3, DRD2, DRD4, COMT, CRHR1, NPY genes and their corresponding manifestations of the ‘resilient phenotype’ have been identified and described. Innate and adaptive immunity can have a significant impact on how cognitive processing of incoming stress-related information occurs, which determines the formation of an appropriate response. On the part of the central nervous system, the genesis of psychological resilience is mainly determined by the functioning of the brain pathways. The psychological prerequisites for the formation and development of psychological resilience are optimism and positive emotional states, perceived control and perceived social support. The genesis of psychological resilience occurs at different levels: molecular-cellular, anatomical-morphological, physiological, individual-psychological and socio-psychological. Despite significant progress, questions remain about the proportionality of the contribution of each of the prerequisites to the ‘resilient phenotype’ and about the mechanisms of their mutual influence.
