Objective: To outline the theoretical and methodological foundations of the railway track oscillation frequency analysis. To justify the need to assess the level of vibrodynamic impact of rolling stock on the elements of the track superstructure and the roadbed. To provide a methodology for calculating the oscillation parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the use of shock-absorbing elements. Methods: The modeling of the oscillatory process of the railway track elements and the analysis of physical models of oscillations were used. Results: The applicability of assessing the level of vibrodynamic impact of rolling stock on the elements of the track superstructure and the roadbed has been confirmed. A physical model of the vibrodynamic force impact of railway rolling stock and the responses of track infrastructure elements is described. The procedure for calculating the natural frequencies of the elements of the track superstructure and the roadbed and the characteristics of the shock-absorbing elements is given. Practical importance: The presented methods for calculating the natural frequencies of the elements of the track superstructure and the roadbed, as well as the characteristics of resilient shock-absorbing elements – rail shock pads and sleeper pads – make it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of their use to reduce the level of vibrodynamic impacts, to protect against resonance, and ensure the train traffic safety.
