Municipalities and regional governments urgently need appropriate strategies to withstand climate catastrophes. As Zoning Officer and Floodplain Administrator for the City of Hoboken, Ann Holtzman has a wealth of experience in this field. She emphasises the importance of not just laying down rules, but also encouraging innovation. This is exemplified by the US Department of Energy's 2013 ‘Rebuild by Design’ competition, whose winning entry – a multi‐practice collaboration – is informing improvements to the area's storm resiliency in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.
