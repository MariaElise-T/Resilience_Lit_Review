AbstractAims:The primary objective of this study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness-based Wellness and Resilience (MBWR): a brief mindfulness-based intervention designed to enhance resilience and is delivered to interdisciplinary primary care teams.Background:Burnout is a pervasive, international problem affecting the healthcare workforce, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased professional effectiveness. Delivery models of mindfulness-based resilience interventions that enhance feasibility for onsite delivery, consider cultural considerations specific to primary care, and utilize team processes that are integral to primary care are now needed.Methods:We conducted a mixed-methods feasibility and acceptability trial of MBWR. Primary feasibility and acceptability outcomes were assessed by number of participants recruited, percent of MBWR treatment completer, and attrition rate during the 8-week intervention, and four items on a Likert-type scale. Secondary outcomes of perceived effects were measured by focus groups, an online survey, and self-reported questionnaires, including the Brief Resilience Scale, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form. Participants included 31 healthcare providers on interdisciplinary primary care teams employed a safety-net medical center. In the MBWR group, 68% identified as Latinx, compared to 64% in the control group.Findings:All criteria for feasibility were met and participants endorsed high levels of satisfaction and acceptability. The results of this study suggest that MBWR provides multiple perceived benefits to the individual healthcare provider, cohesion of the healthcare team, and enhanced patient care. MBWR may be a feasible and acceptable method to integrate mindfulness, resilience, and teamwork training into the primary care setting.
