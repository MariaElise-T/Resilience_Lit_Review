Historic urban areas are the beating heart of the city, but neglecting them can lead to low resilience. Therefore, paying attention to their regeneration can create a sustainable city. The purpose of this study was to determine the resilience of neighborhoods in Tehran and evaluate effective criteria for the resilience increase. In this study, to evaluate the resilience of Tehran, initially, 18 criteria were considered. Then, using the Delphi technique, 14 criteria among them were selected for final analysis. Using the AHP multi-criteria decision-making method, the importance of each criterion was determined. Using GIS capabilities, the parameters map was prepared, and by combining the prepared maps with AHP weights, a resilience map was created. Finally, 20 neighborhoods with the lowest resilience were identified as priorities for stabilization and regeneration measures, and the criteria status used in them was examined. Results showed that deteriorated urban areas (19.53%) and construction materials (18.51%) were the most important criteria. Non-resilience areas were generally in the southern half of the city. 78% of 20 selected neighborhoods had deteriorated urban areas, while only 14% of the city deteriorated. Finally, by examining the criteria in neighborhoods with the lowest resilience, suggestions were made to regeneration, sustainability, and increase the resilience of these neighborhoods.
