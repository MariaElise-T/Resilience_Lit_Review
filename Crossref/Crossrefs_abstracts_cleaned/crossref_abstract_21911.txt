Early life heat stress leads to either resilience or vulnerability to a similar stress later in life. We have previously shown that this tuning of the stress response depends on neural network organization in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) thermal response center and is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we expand our understanding of stress response establishment describing a role for epitranscriptomic regulation of the epigenetic machinery. Specifically, we explore the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation in long-term response to heat stress. Heat conditioning of 3-d-old chicks diminished m6A RNA methylation in the hypothalamus, simultaneously with an increase in the mRNA levels of the m6A demethylase, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). Moreover, a week later, methylation of two heat stress-related transcripts, histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were downregulated in harsh-heat-conditioned chicks. During heat challenge a week after conditioning, there was a reduction of m6A levels in mild-heat-conditioned chicks and an elevation in harsh-heat-conditioned ones. This increase in m6A modification was negatively correlated with the expression levels of bothBDNFandEZH2. Antisense “knock-down” of FTO caused an elevation of global m6A RNA methylation, reduction ofEZH2andBDNFmRNA levels, and decrease in global H3K27 dimethylation as well as dimethyl H3K27 level alongBDNFcoding region, and, finally, led to heat vulnerability. These findings emphasize the multilevel regulation of gene expression, including both epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulatory mechanisms, fine-tuning the neural network organization in a response to stress.
