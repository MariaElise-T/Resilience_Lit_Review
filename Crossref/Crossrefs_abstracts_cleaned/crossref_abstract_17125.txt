Resilience is an important property of transport infrastructure networks. Resilient transport infrastructure networks can retain the performance in case of disturbances and quickly recover to the original performance level after the disturbances. This study proposes a new approach that can measure the resilience of transport infrastructure networks. The new approach gives a unified conceptual framework for measuring the resilience of transport infrastructure networks. A network simulation-based method is used to analyze the influential factors of transport infrastructure network resilience. A new measuring method is developed based on network diversity characteristic to quantitatively measure the system resilience and node resilience of transport infrastructure networks. China railway and air transport networks are selected as a case study to applicability of new approach. This new approach provides strong supports for academic and industrial fields to measure, analyze, enhance, and optimize the resilience of transport infrastructure networks.
