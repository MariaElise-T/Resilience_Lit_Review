Achieving sustainable development and reducing climate change require a shift to green energy sources. Yet, switching to green energy sources necessitates substantial research and development, as well as regulatory and policy adjustments. Additionally, a number of obstacles are impeding the development of green energy innovation. This study identified several key barriers and sub-barriers that obstruct the development of green energy innovation. Thus, this study identified multiple strategies to overcome those barriers. Therefore, this study uses the fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods to assess and rank the barriers and strategies to building resilient energy systems in China. First, the fuzzy AHP method identifies the four barriers and sixteen sub-barriers, while the fuzzy TOPSIS method classifies six strategies for the green energy innovation system in China. According to AHP results, funding and policy constraints are the most crucial barriers to green energy innovation. The fuzzy TOPSIS findings show that providing incentives for green energy investment and strengthening policy implementation and enforcement are the most significant strategies for overcoming the barriers to green energy projects.
