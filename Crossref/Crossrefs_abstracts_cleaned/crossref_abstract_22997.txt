AbstractNotwithstanding the fundamental role that environmental microbes play for ecosystem functioning, data on how microbes react to disturbances are still scarce, and most factors that confer stability to microbial communities are unknown. In this context, antibiotic discharge into the environment is considered a worldwide threat for ecosystems with potential risks to human health. We therefore tested resilience of microbial communities challenged by the presence of an antibiotic. In a continuous culture experiment, we compared the abundance, composition and diversity of microbial communities undisturbed or disturbed by the constant addiction of tetracycline in low (10 µg/L) or intermediate (100 µg/L) concentration (press disturbance). Further, the bacterial communities in the three treatments had to face the sudden pulse disturbance of adding an allochthonous bacterium (Escherichia coli). Tetracycline, even at low concentrations, affected microbial communities by changing their phylogenetic composition and causing cell aggregation. This, however, did not coincide with a reduced microbial diversity, but was mainly caused by a shift in dominance of specific bacterial families. Moreover, the less disturbed community (10 µg/L tetracycline) was sometimes more similar to the control and sometimes more similar to heavily disturbed community (100 µg/L tetracycline). All in all, we could not see a pattern where the communities disturbed with antibiotics were less resilient to a second disturbance introducing E. coli, but they seemed to be able to buffer the input of the allochthonous strain in a similar manner as the control.
