The intervention study explored the resilience needs of retrenched workers aged between 27 and 57 years. Purposive sampling was used to select a sample size of 19 participants. The sample size was determined by the saturation level which occurred when the participants were repeating responses. The participants had varied educational backgrounds and previous work-related experiences. In-depth interviews were conducted, using semi-structured interview guides, to collect data on the resilience needs of the sample. Data were grouped into themes, categories, subcategories and analysed using content analysis. The study found out that prematurely loss of employment through retrenchment brings a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, uncertainty, guilt and shame. It was found that social connectedness, relational structures and emotional regulation are important protective factors of building resilience in the face of employment loss. Functional cognitive skills enabled the retrenched workers to exercise positive thinking.Â  Professional mental health counselling services helped to restore the lost hope and confidence among the retrenched workers.
