 Electric rates in Plattsburgh, New York are among the least expensive in the United States. Plattsburgh’s rates are set by a preference power program that was enacted in 1957 to promote rural economic development. A survey distributed to customers of Plattsburgh’s municipally-owned electric utility inquired about familiarity with local electric rates and energy systems, conservation behaviors, and attitudes towards policy interventions intended to encourage conservation. Results indicate that energy consumers in Plattsburgh hold a moderate degree of familiarity with the community’s energy system and implement strong conservation actions. Support for policy interventions are mixed. Survey results reveal income inequality, as differences in conservation attitudes and behaviors are apparent among respondents that report varying degrees of financial vulnerability. Today, Plattsburgh is in need of a resilient energy system, yet inexpensive rates discourage investment in infrastructure. This research reveals the complex social, economic and policy forces interacting to determine Plattsburgh’s energy future.
