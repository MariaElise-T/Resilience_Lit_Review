The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious psychological impact on society, including young people. Teenagers experience various problems such as anxiety, depression, stress which of course will affect the decline in resilience (resilient) in dealing with life. Resilience is a person's ability to respond in a healthy and productive way when faced with adversity. To build resilience, young people need to pay attention to the aspect of religiosity. Religiosity is a condition, understanding and obedience of a person in believing in a religion that is manifested in the appreciation of values so as to encourage someone to behave according to religious teachings in everyday life. This condition of religiosity is explored through ideological, ritual, appreciation, intellectual and experiential dimensions. This study aims to discuss the relationship of religiosity in increasing the resilience of adolescents during the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between religiosity and resilience of adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stages of the research method are firstly to capture teenagers as research subjects who are still in junior and senior high school through convenience sampling by filling out a questionnaire in the form of a scale. Then the incoming data is processed and analyzed. From the data processing, conclusions can be drawn as a basis for intervention for adolescents so that they have qualified resilience. After the implementation of the first phase of research, the expected output is an article published in a national journal. The results showed that religiosity was related to adolescent resilience (r = .758 and p < .01). The higher the level of religiosity, the higher the resilience of teenagers in the current pandemic era.
