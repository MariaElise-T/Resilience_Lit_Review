 This study contends that the growth trajectory of disadvantaged youth does not need to follow the expected negative path. Diversified developmental patterns may be observed due to the resilience acquired in the process. To consider the cultural background of Taiwan, we selected five parent-youth dyads from economically poor families and explored possible mechanisms contributing to the educational success of children. Data are taken from in-depth interviews of Taiwan Youth Project (TYP). Drawing from memories of both parent and youth on how family practice and family relations contribute to resilience, we are able to document that educational resilience is the key to alter the negative developmental course. Among various individual and family strategies examined, parents’ high aspiration and expectation of children’s educational achievement is found to be the most pronounced factor leading to the positive outcome in terms of educational mobility. Analyzing the retrospective accounts of both generations, it is clear that parental expectation needs to be well perceived and accepted by children in order to achieve its goal. Furthermore, supportive parenting, actively monitoring children’s homework since young, and providing better educational resources are conducive to constructing educational resilience. The implication of shared educational norms across different social classes is briefly discussed.
