 Caring for children with cancer is stressful for parents and leads to psychological distress, which is mainly manifested as depressive symptoms and anxiety. This study explored the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between stress and psychological distress in parents of children with cancer. We recruited 258 parents of children with cancer in three tertiary hospitals in Mainland China. The results revealed that the mediating effect of resilience for the relationships between stress and depressive symptoms and between stress and anxiety accounted for 23.4% and 11.4%, respectively, of the total effect. Resilience was confirmed as a protective factor that can be incorporated into future intervention programmes to improve the psychological well-being of parents of children with cancer. Future studies could develop resilience training programmes to enhance the resilience of parents of children with cancer to alleviate parentsâ€™ psychological distress.
