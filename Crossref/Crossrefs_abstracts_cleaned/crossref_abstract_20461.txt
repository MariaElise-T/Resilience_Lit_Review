AbstractWith the advances in modern medicine and the adaptation towards healthier lifestyles, the average life expectancy has doubled since the 1930s, with individuals born in the millennium years now carrying an estimated life expectancy of around 100 years. And even though many individuals around the globe manage to age successfully, the prevalence of aging‐associated neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer’s disease has never been as high as nowadays. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease is anticipated to triple by 2050, increasing the societal and economic burden tremendously. Despite all efforts, there is still no available treatment defeating the accelerated aging process as seen in this disease. Yet, given the advances in neuroimaging techniques that are discussed in the current Review article, such as in positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pivotal insights into the heterogenous effects of aging‐associated processes and the contribution of distinct lifestyle and risk factors already have and are still being gathered. In particular, the concepts of resilience (i.e. coping with brain pathology) and resistance (i.e. avoiding brain pathology) have more recently been discussed as they relate to mechanisms that are associated with the prolongation and/or even stop of the progressive brain aging process. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resilience and resistance may one day, hopefully, support the identification of defeating mechanism against accelerating aging.image
