Abstract
This study aims to analyze mathematical resilience based on the level of mastery of students’ mathematical skills in solving word problems. This research was a mix-method study with selected research subjects who were four independent learners, three instruction learners, and three frustration learners of class VII in Baleendah. The instruments of this study were test and non-test (interviews and mathematical resilience questionnaires). The results showed that: (1) the excellent mathematical resilience of the independent learner impacted the positive outcomes of students in overcoming difficulties that existed in mathematical application problems. But, students’ who had good mathematical resilience (medium category) didn’t affect overcoming obstacles in word problems; (2) good mathematical resilience (medium category) from the instruction learner had a positive impact on overcoming challenges in word problems. Mathematical resilience in frustration learner (medium category, but partly low group) had an effect on the complexity of solving mathematical problems, and (3) mathematical resilience in frustration learner who got very low/low grade affects the challenge of solving mathematical application problems. However, students at the level of frustration have an excellent resilience ability (medium category) but do not modify the difficulties they experience (still having trouble) in solving word problems.
