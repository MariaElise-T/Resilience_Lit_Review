For the purposes of disaster prevention and disaster mitigation against the upcoming Nankai Trough Earthquake, various efforts are being carried out. The undertaking is on the basis of lessons learned from the experience of the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku and other disasters. In the Kochi Prefecture, where serious damage is expected, significant effort is being directed towards preparing social infrastructure countermeasures for the earthquake and, particularly, the tsunami. This paper focuses on the efforts towards local resilience being made in the Kochi Prefecture and discusses new disaster-prevention countermeasures with respect to sea dikes, liquefaction, and tsunami fires.
