Two groups of government workers were involved in career portfolio development workshops that were designed to expand the workers' thinking about their career accomplishments, enhance their sense of career resilience, and create portfolios. Focus groups conducted after the workshops indicated that participants began to engage in “portfolio thinking” and to think of an expanded range of career options, which were reflective of increased levels of career resilience.
