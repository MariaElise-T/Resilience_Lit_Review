The paper presents laboratory methods of testing the prototype resilient mats, used in rail track systems in order to reduce vibrations transmitted to the vicinity of the railroad and to improve the resistance of the railroad structure. The laboratory testing program was carried out for elastomeric materials (polyurethane based). The key parameters being investigated in the Warsaw University of Technology laboratory unit were used in order to determine the insertion loss vibration level by applying analytical method. The paper presents the influence of selected parameters i.e. static and dynamic moduli on the reduction of vibration and structure-borne sound level â€“ i.e. the value of insertion loss parameters.
