The present study was a first attempt to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relationships between fear of happiness and affect balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing. Participants consisted of 256 Turkish adults (174 males and 82 females) and aged between 18 and 62 years (M = 36.97, SD = 9.02). Participants completed measures assessing fear of happiness, affect balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing. The results showed that fear of happiness was negatively correlated with resilience, affect balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing, while resilience was positively correlated with affect balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing. The results of mediation analysis showed that (a) resilience fully mediated the effect of fear of happiness upon flourishing, and satisfaction with life, (b) partially mediated the effect of fear of happiness upon affect balance. These findings suggest that resilience helps to explain the associations between fear of happiness and affect balance, satisfaction with life, and flourishing. This study elucidates the potential mechanism behind the association between fear of happiness and indicators of well-being.
