 Individuals with personality disorders (PDs) comprise 30% to 40% of individuals receiving mental health treatment. Treatment of PDs is exceedingly difficult; therefore, research has focused on PD etiology and preventative factors. One known influence on PD etiology is adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). ACEs are associated with increased prevalence of several health risk behaviors (HRBs), including engagement in substance use, criminal, and risky sexual behavior. One protective factor, childhood resiliency, predicts lower prevalence of PDs and engagement in HRBs. We hypothesized that increased prevalence of ACEs would predict higher levels of PD symptoms and HRBs engagement. Furthermore, we predicted that childhood resiliency would moderate the relation between ACEs, PD symptoms, and HRBs. In the present study, students (N = 531) completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences survey, the Self-Administered – Standardized Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale, and the Childhood Youth and Resiliency Measure-28. They also responded to questions about substance use, criminal, and sexual behavior which were used to define a latent HRB variable. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine study hypotheses. As hypothesized, we found positive relations between ACEs, PD symptoms, and our HRB latent variable. Childhood resiliency moderated both ACE and PD symptom paths. At lower levels of reported ACEs, individuals high in childhood resiliency reported fewer PD symptoms and HRBs than individuals low in childhood resiliency. At high levels of ACEs, childhood resiliency did not serve as a protective factor. Additionally, study findings suggest that childhood resiliency factors are integral for protecting against the development of these disorders.
