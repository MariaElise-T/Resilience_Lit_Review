AbstractThe resilience of buildings can be improved by revising the methods of building management. This paper discusses the development of a new building management system for continuity of important operations. In the early stages after a disaster, it is important to assess what happened, the actual conditions, whether important operation spaces can be used, the causes of malfunctions, and what should be done to achieve continuity or early restoration of functions. This report presents a methodology to support the process of systematically confirming the actual conditions, judgment, adjustment, and actions for the building manager.
