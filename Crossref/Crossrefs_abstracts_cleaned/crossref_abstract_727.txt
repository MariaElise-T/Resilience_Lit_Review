This study assessed local leadership necessary for developing city resilience in the phase of more escalating, complicated and critical disaster phenomenon. The study departed from an assumption of the need for an effective and creative model of local leadership in order to transform risks into resilience, so that the city possesses a local capacity to develop Semarang as the resilient city. Leadership competency can be taught and trained by a leadership education and training under the Center for Education and Training of the Provincial Government of Central Java.
