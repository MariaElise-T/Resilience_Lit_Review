 Impact and adjustment to a drainage enterostomy are measured mainly through health indicators. To investigate the relationship between resilience and adaptation to the placement of a drainage enterostomy. Prospective observational study with a sample of 125 patients (64 men/36 women) with a temporary or permanent drainage enterostomy and a mean age of 66.72â€‰years. High quality of life (mean, 80.5) and resilience (mean, 79.57) scores and a positive relationship between both were found. There seems to be a positive relationship with general quality of life and health-related quality of life. The logistic regression model shows that the main predictor as regards health-related quality of life is resilience.
