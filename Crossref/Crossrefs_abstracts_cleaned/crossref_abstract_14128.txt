The concept of disaster response routes for damage reduction has emerged owing to recent large-scale earthquakes. Disaster response routes play an important role in the initial disaster response and recovery by evacuating populations and transferring supplies for disaster response. This study estimated the importance of each road that can be used as a disaster response route after the outbreak of disaster from the viewpoint of disaster resilience and network centrality and developed six types of priority indexes for road recovery based on the purpose of disaster recovery and the function of the disaster response route. Using these priority indexes developed in this study, critical roads for disaster recovery can be identified in short- and long-term periods. Disaster recovery is assumed to improve if disaster response routes are promptly assigned and restored based on these priority indexes.
