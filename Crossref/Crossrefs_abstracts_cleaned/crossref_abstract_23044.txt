Upon chronic stress, a fraction of individuals shows stress resilience, which can prevent long-term mental dysfunction. The underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and have not yet been fully understood. In this study, we performed a data-driven behavioural stratification together with single-cell transcriptomics of the hippocampus in a mouse model of chronic social defeat stress. Our work revealed that in a sub-group exhibiting molecular responses upon chronic stress, the dorsal hippocampus is particularly involved in neuroimmune responses, angiogenesis, myelination, and neurogenesis, thereby enabling brain restoration and homeostasis after chronic stress. Based on these molecular insights, we applied rapamycin after the stress as a proof-of-concept pharmacological intervention and were able to substantially increase stress resilience. Our findings serve as a data resource and can open new avenues for further understanding of molecular processes underlying stress response and for targeted interventions supporting resilience.
