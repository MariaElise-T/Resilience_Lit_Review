Crossfit facilities in dense, multi-use facilities are growing in numbers every day. Even minimally sensitive receivers can be very significantly impacted by Crossfit activities. Consequently, vibration and vibration induced noise in structures as a result of heavy weight drops are a never ending issue. This paper compares data recorded from heavy weight drops in an ASTM E492 floor/ceiling testing suite. The resultant sound pressure level in the receiving room and vibration levels in the structure are measured. Several different standard and high performance resilient sports floorings are compared. These sports floors are tested on single concrete slabs as well as various floating slabs. The floating slabs include continuous rubber underlayments, discrete rubber isolators and spring jack-up floating floors. In addition, laboratory impact and airborne isolation performance results of a spring jack-up floating floor are reported.
