AbstractBackgroundβ‐amyloid (Aβ) positive (A+) cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals who maintain normal cognitive function at follow‐up may have good cognitive resilience (CR). A+/CU Individuals with high CR may have hypermetabolism. In this study, we explored the cortical glucose metabolism features of CR in A+/CU elderly adults.MethodWe analyzed 855 ADNI participants with Aβ PET (18F‐florbetapir (FBP) or 18F‐florbetaben (FBB)), CSF p‐Tau181, 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and longitudinal residual hippocampal volume (rHCV) and cognitive assessments. A+/T+/N+ were defined as AD summary cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for FBP ≥1.11 or FBB ≥1.08, CSF p‐Tau≥23pg/ml, and rHCV≤‐0.67 respectively. We compared intensity‐ and spatial‐normalized FDG SUVR images between 96 A‐/T‐/N‐/CU individuals (Reference group) and 68 A+/CU individuals who maintained CU at follow‐up regardless of T+ or N+ (CR group). Cortical regions with higher FDG SUVR in the CR group were identified as the CR_metaROI. Baseline CR_metaROI FDG‐SUVRs were compared between different stages of AD. Finally, we determined whether CR_metaROI FDG‐SUVR can modulate the association of Aβ PET and CSF p‐Tau with longitudinal changes of cognition, controlling for age, sex, and education.ResultCR_metaROI was primarily located in the precentral and postcentral regions (Fig. 1). AD dementia patients had lower CR_metaROI FDG SUVRs than the CU (standardized β (βstd) = ‐0.326[95% confidence interval (ci): ‐0.534, ‐0.119], p = 0.002) and MCI (βstd = ‐0.303[95%ci: ‐0.496, ‐0.111], p = 0.002) groups (Fig. 2A), and A+/CU group had higher (βstd = 0.605[95%ci: 0.352, 0.859], p<0.001) CR_metaROI FDG SUVRs than the A‐/CU group (Fig. 2B). A‐/T+ and A+/T‐ individuals had lower (βstd = ‐0.248[95%ci: ‐0.4474, ‐0.022], p = 0.031) and higher (βstd = 0.305[95%ci: 0.093, 0.516], p = 0.005) CR_metaROI FDG SUVRs than the A‐/T‐ group respectively (Fig. 2C). The A+/T‐/N+ group had higher (βstd = 0.466[95%ci: 0.153, 0.779], p = 0.004) CR_metaROI FDG SUVRs than the A‐/T‐/N‐group (Fig. 2D). Moreover, higher baseline metaROI FDG‐SUVRs were associated with slower rates of decline in memory, executive function and preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite scores upon the same levels of Aβ PET (Fig. 3A‐C) and CSF p‐Tau (Fig. 3D‐F).ConclusionWe identified a metabolism signature of CR in A+/CU elderly adults. These findings may provide novel insights into understanding the hypermetabolism patterns of CR in aging people.
