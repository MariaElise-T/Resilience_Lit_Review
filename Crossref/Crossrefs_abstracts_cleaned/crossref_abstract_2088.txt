 A research project was conducted in 2020 to assess the sustainability and resiliency of various buried drainage structures relative to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. As a result of this project, a risk assessment and rating system was proposed that calculates the risks that various extreme weather events, natural disasters, and other threats pose to buried drainage structures. One thing that differentiates this proposed risk assessment methodology from others is its holistic approach to sustainability and resiliency. The basis for this holistic approach is that the use of less sustainable materials contributes more to climate change, which in turn exacerbates the magnitudes and frequencies of extreme weather events, thereby increasing the importance of resiliency in buried drainage structures. Because of this relationship, the proposed risk index calculations and vulnerability ratings take into account factors assessing both the sustainability and resiliency of buried drainage structures.
