Abstract
This study aims to determine the level of resilience of the people of Baleendah Village in dealing with floods. This research uses a holistic approach that considers all aspects as a whole. The approach known as mixed research methods. The mixed research method strategy used is concurrent triangulation strategy, where researchers collect qualitative and quantitative data together, then compare the two data to find out the difference or a combination. The community resilience variable used in this study refers to guidelines for measuring disaster resilience issued by GOAL (2015) that has 30 variables that are grouped into 5 thematic areas. These variables include knowledge and education; emergency preparedness and response; and risk management and vulnerability reduction. Based on the analysis of 3 variables and 10 aspects of community resilience, it can be concluded that the Baleendah Village community currently has a resilience level at the “RESILIENT” level, which means that the community can adapt and have a solution to overcome the floods. Based on the study findings, there are two main problems in increasing the resilience of the Baleendah Village community, namely access to financial assistance for people who are economically in the low income community category, and sanitation.
