AbstractThis study shows how inherent energy resilience for process systems can be conceptualized from the perspectives of material resilience. Equations are derived to assess inherent energy resilience properties of constituent process systems of a gas sweetening unit (GSU). A new method is introduced for identifying thermodynamically efficient operating capacity regime for optimization of energy usage in GSU. It is found that the GSU operating capacity range of 80â€“100% is the most thermodynamically efficient operating capacity regime. It is evaluated that operation of the GSU below 80% of its design capacity will incur higher percentage of wastage of valuable work in spite of spending lesser total work. Process simulator, Pro/II has been utilized for this study.
