AbstractAgriculture is one of top best-selling non-oil-and-gas products. However, environmental-related purposes for production, based on the Regulation of Forestry Ministry of Republic of Indonesia No P50/Menhut-II/2010 for the Right to Exploit, not meet the Ecosystem Reforestation Rights. Land degradation means loss of the productive capacity of the soils that has huge risk to food insecurity, loss of ecosystem biodiversity and climate change. In Tapin, one of the most productive agriculture in South Kalimantan Province, dramatic decline in the productivity of croplands can be one of the most important contributors of climate change. The action of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by adapting innovation has been a solution of reducing vulnerability and increase climate change resilience to combat rising demands for agriculture product and the agricultural production system. Smallholder farmers and rural community need to intensify the production of food for sustainable agriculture and food security, as mentioned in Sustainable Develompent Goals (SDGs) Goals 15.
