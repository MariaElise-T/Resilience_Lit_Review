Abstract
Global society is pursuing sustainable community and city which are integrated and resilient against great disaster. This paper insists that traditional wisdom cultivated in Japan here should be reappraised in such modern contest. “Waju”, or “circle and collaboration” is a traditional and vernacular culture in Aichi, Japan. In this field, autonomous sprit has developed for some hundred years, independent of government by Kyoto and Edo – giving birth to global automotive industry today. Historical citizens in Waju community have promoted autonomy for disaster prevention and local supply of infrastructure and logistics for adaptation to hazardous environment. In fact they have built circle river levee, shared water supply inside and private ships in case of flood. This autonomous Waju spirit is realized and sustained in an advanced industry island in Aichi, with modern context of business continuity planning. 100 companies here are now collaborating for not only tsunami evacuation, self-ambulance system, partnership with infrastructure companies but also for building new bridge and road for logistics. These days, Waju sees new evolution by advanced technology. Local government and automotive companies in Aichi are now discussing holistic strategy for sustaining global automotive industry. More than 100 people are acting on large hazard map using augmented reality in the same time. They are making a circle surrounding the map, inheriting Waju spirit. Japanese community here has been struggling with disaster and making precious cultures in complete history with adaptive evolution. Traditional spirit and advanced modern technology will create Wajus all over the world in the future.
