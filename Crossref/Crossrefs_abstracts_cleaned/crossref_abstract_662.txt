US Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) projects have reduced coastal vulnerability and helped communities anticipate and mitigate toward improved resilience. This study proposes the Coastal Resilience Index (CRI) to quantify storm damage reduction benefits due to beach restoration projects in the context of resilience. The CRI considers metrics of the beach and dune system and disturbance factors such as storm surge and waves, using five non-dimensional factors: Protective Elevation (PE), Volume Density (VD), Protective Width (PW), Crest Freeboard (CF) and wave run-up (WR). The CRI is the summation of these five non-dimensional factors. This study developed a geographic information systems (GIS) based tool to automatically extract morphologic features from historic profiles and profiles extracted from LiDAR data to quantify beach resilience over time.
