Objectives: Positive mental health in school predicts positive mental
                        health throughout the lifetime. Positive Psychology interventions (PPIs) in
                        secondary schools have been shown to improve mental health outcomes for
                        students. The Hummingbird Project, a brief, multi-component PPI, educates
                        secondary school students in a variety of Positive Psychology concepts, in
                        the hope of improving mental health outcomes in this cohort.
Design: Over a 4-year period (pilot, N = 90; full study year 1, N =
                        1,054; year 2, N = 876; year 3, N = 907), this intervention educated
                        secondary school students on the concepts of happiness, gratitude, kindness,
                        mindfulness, character strengths, hope, and growth mindsets.
Outcomes: The intervention led to improvements in; student well-being,
                        as measured by the World Health Organisation Well-Being Index (WHO-5);
                        resilience, as measured by the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS); hope, as
                        measured by the Children’s Hope Scale (CHS); symptoms of mental distress, as
                        measured by the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation
                        (YP-CORE).
Conclusions: These results show that a brief, multicomponent, PPI,
                        delivered by non-specialist staff, can improve mental health outcomes in
                        secondary school settings. This masterclass will show some of the methods
                        employed in the delivery of the Hummingbird Project, discuss some of the
                        various pitfalls one might encounter when attempting to deliver such
                        psychological interventions in a school setting, and give participants an
                        opportunity to try some of the activities involved in sessions. Participants
                        will leave with a clearer understanding of some quick, simple exercises that
                        can be performed with their students to improve mental health outcomes and
                        academic attainment.
