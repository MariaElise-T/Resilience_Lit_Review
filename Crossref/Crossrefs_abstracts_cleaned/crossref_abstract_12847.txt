Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the lives of pediatric oncology social workers. Challenges include difficulty building rapport with the use of telephone/computers, lack of clarity around who is designated as “essential”, structural challenges, isolation, and witnessing distress. This study aimed to describe the ways that the pandemic has personally impacted pediatric oncology social workers. Methods: Participants were recruited through the Association of Pediatric Oncology Social Workers (APOSW) listserv. In total, 101 participants from 31 states and the District of Columbia completed an online survey containing quantitative and open-ended questions. Qualitative data analysis included thematic analysis of participants’ optional survey responses to three open-ended questions. Results: Fifty-seven of the participants provided responses that revealed 3 first level codes and 11 second level codes. First level codes were developed a priori from the questions: Experiences that stay with you, Wisdom gained and Impact on your work. Pandemic-related challenges caused moral suffering and professional challenges for participants but also created opportunities to find meaning in their work. Conclusion: Data illuminated moral suffering, unrecognized resilience, new ways of maintaining self-and family care, and creative approaches to care of children with cancer and their families at diagnosis, during treatments and at the end of life.
