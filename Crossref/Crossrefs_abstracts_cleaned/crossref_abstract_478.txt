AbstractVarious heat pump technologies are examined from an environmental perspective using a life cycle assessment approach. The investigated heat pump systems utilize air, ground, and water as their energy sources. Additionally, an innovative heat pump powered by green hydrogen is investigated in this study, to evaluate its environmental impacts and potential to commercialise on a large scale. A range of supply chain scenarios is explored, considering the main suppliers of the UK market. The reshoring heat pump industry and supply chain are evaluated to enhance energy resilience and security within the UK. The findings indicate that the hydrogen-based heat pump presents a promising option for the UK market, offering the advantages of reducing stress on the national grid network and minimizing the environmental impacts associated with the supply chain. Furthermore, a forecasting analysis is conducted based on the UK's net-zero emission plan to provide insight into future developments.
