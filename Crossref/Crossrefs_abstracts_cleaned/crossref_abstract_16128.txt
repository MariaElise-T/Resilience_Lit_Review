Reputation systems aim to reduce the risk of loss due to untrustworthy participants by providing a mechanism for establishing trustworthiness between mutually unknown online entities in an information asymmetric e-market. These systems encourage honest behavior and discourage malicious behavior of buyer and seller agents by laying a foundation for security and stability in the e-market. However, the success of a reputation system depends on its built-in resilience capabilities to foil various attacks. This paper focuses on how to safeguard buyers from dishonest sellers and advisors by incorporating an attack resilient reputation computation methodology. The objectives of the proposed dynamic reputation system in the distributed environment are to reduce the incentive for behaving dishonestly, and to minimize harm in case of attacks by dishonest participants with the inherent purpose of improving the quality of services in the e-market.
