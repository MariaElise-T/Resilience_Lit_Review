Topic

This is the first study to focus on the self-attribution
bias in financial decision and resilience relation. Resilience is one of the
empowering factor to
alleviate the negative effects of stressors and adversities, to comply with the
new situations and to think in realistic way. When considered this point of
view, self-attribution bias in
financial decision and resilience relation could be an important subject.

 

Background

There is no any
scientific work about the subject of the self-attribution bias in financial
decision and resilience relation. In this study it is aslo analyzed the effect
of resilience trainings on self attribution bias and resilience. 

 

Purpose/Aim

One of the
aims of this work is to invesitegate the self-attribution bias in financial
decision and resilience correlation. The other aim is to find an evidence of how
the self-attribution bias in financial decision and resilience changes with
resilience centered trainings.

 

Scope/Method

For this
reason individual self-attribution bias and resilience scores are measured. In
order to measure the self attribution bias, specific statemens about the bias
are conducted. To evaluate the resilience scores, The Turkish version of the
Resilience Scale for Adults is used.                


 

Results

The results
show firstly, there is a negative relation between the self attribution bias and
the resilience. Secondly it is seen that, the self attribution bias scores are
decreased and the resilience scores are increased after the resilience centered
trainings. 

 

Conclusions

Importantly,
our results provide the evidence about the relation of self attribution bias
and resilience and the effect of resilience centered trainings on these
factors. On the other hand, it is needed more research studies to validate and understand
these findings.
