Land use transition and its eco-environmental effects are important research topics. Its essence is the process that human activities exert interference to the ecological environment in the process of social and economic development, and the ecosystem resists interference and recovers and adapts to interference. The article starts from the transition of land use dominant morphology and takes ecological resilience as the breakthrough point. Based on four periods of land use data, this article studied the spatio-temporal evolution of land use and ecological resilience and the response of ecological resilience to land use transition in China from 1990 to 2020. The results showed as follows: (1) During the study period, the construction land in China continued to increase, and the forest land, grassland, and farmland showed a fluctuating trend. (2) The spatial distribution pattern of ecological resilience showed the characteristics of “high in the southeast and low in the northwest”. The mean value and total value of ecological resilience in the region decreased first and then increased, taking 2010 as the dividing line. The difference in ecological resilience increased first and then decreased. (3) Ecological land and construction land are the main types of land that affect the changes in ecological resilience. The higher the proportion of ecological lands such as forest land, grassland, and waters, the smaller the variable coefficient of ecological resilience. The higher the proportion of construction land, the greater the difference in ecosystem elasticity among different types of areas.
