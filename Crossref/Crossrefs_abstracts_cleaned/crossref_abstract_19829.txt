Rooted in natural and engineering sciences, the concept of resilience has attracted growing attention in social science and public policy. The evolving resilience paradigm assumes the concept is at odds with state control, and instead emphasises the coping capacities of communities and individuals. This assumption might overlook the multifaceted and context-specific nature of resilience. Drawing on an empirical study of state-led reconstruction planning, this article argues that it is the deep and active involvement of the state, rather than its retreat, that helps promote resilience building in Chinaâ€™s earthquake-hit areas. Through a combination of online questionnaire survey and interviews, the article assesses how the Chinese state mobilises and coordinates a wide range of state and non-state actors to enable communities to achieve different aspects of resilience, while also sometimes constraining them from doing so.
