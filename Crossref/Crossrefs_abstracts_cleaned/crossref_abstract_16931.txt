The ability to respond to stress, defined as resilience, was measured by white blood cell counts in C57BL/6 mice of various ages receiving a nonlethal dose of cyclophosphamide (CYP). Neutrophil counts dipped and then rebounded in a consistent and age-dependent manner. Low neutrophil rebound correlated with improved learning in middle-age mice suggesting CYP-nduced neutrophil response may predict resilience to aging.
