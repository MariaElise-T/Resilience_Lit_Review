Based on Freud’s personality theory, 839 nurses from 5 public hospitals in Shandong Province were selected by the convenience sampling method. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the correlation among resilience, work-family conflict (WFC), and anxiety (SAS). The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship among resilience, WFC, and SAS of these nurses and to provide evidence with reducing WFC and SAS for the nurses. The results showed that the total score of resilience, WFC, and SAS was

It is suggested that hospital managers should pay attention to the mental health of nurses, take active intervention measures according to the influencing factors of SAS, improve nurses’ psychological resilience, reduce WFC and anxiety, improve nurses’ mental health and well-being, and ensure nursing safety.
