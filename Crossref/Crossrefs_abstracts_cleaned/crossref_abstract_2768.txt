There are strong indications that the built environment has had a great influence on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-disaster recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected both human and global development, while efforts to combat this menace call for an integrated human social capital index. This research seeks to enhance understanding of how the built environment can be enhanced through resilience against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the impact of a resilient built environment on increasing resilience in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The quantitative studies test the impact of four built environment resilience indices (built environment capital, disaster management indices, awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, and built environment adaptive strategies) on human social capital and COVID-19 pandemic indices. This study reveals the role of human social capital in achieving a resilient built environment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Built environment capital, disaster management indices, and awareness of COVID-19 also indirectly affect the COVID-19 pandemic indices through human social capital. This studyâ€™s implications are useful for post-COVID-19 recovery, which is important for future planning of the built environment in Nigeria.
