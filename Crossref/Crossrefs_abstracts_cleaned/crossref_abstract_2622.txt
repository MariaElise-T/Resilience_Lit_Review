Abstract
New challenges for delivering more resilient and less energy-dependent office buildings require a better understanding of thermal comfort in different contexts and opportunities for adaptation. This study aims to determine comfort temperatures in 18 office buildings located in two Chilean cities. The methodology was based on a longitudinal fieldwork during 1 day in winter, spring and summer at each building, collecting data from surveys to the occupants and measurements. The results showed that comfort temperature varied consistently between both contexts and between different seasons, with wider seasonal variation of comfort temperatures in buildings where occupants are allowed to operate windows.
