Abstract
          Background The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically affects children’s
                    and adolescents’ mental health. The accumulation of stress factors and a
                    lack of social support complicate a healthy development. Since the beginning of
                    the pandemic, there has been almost a doubling of mental health problems in
                    children and adolescents. Promoting resilience is a possible approach to reduce
                    the incidence of mental health problems despite these adverse circumstances.
          Objectives This literature search aims at identifying and evaluating
                    interventions to promote resilience mechanisms, with a special focus on
                    feasibility in a crisis situation.
          Materials and methods This scoping review is based on a systematic
                    literature search including the databases Cochrane Library, PubMed, Psyc-Info,
                    Psyndex and Google Scholar (2006–2020). Of 1733 identified articles 75
                    were included.
          Results Out of 72 identified intervention studies 28% were
                    feasible under pandemic conditions. The most effective resilience trainings seem
                    to be individualized interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy elements.
                    However, many approaches primarily show short-term success.
          Discussion Few evidence-based programs are feasible online or under
                    pandemic restrictions. Most of them show short-term effects and focus on parents
                    and individuals. Multiple programs are ready for use, but still lack proof of
                    efficacy. The development and improvement of (digital) resilience interventions
                    should be an essential part of preventive health care, especially for risk
                    groups.
