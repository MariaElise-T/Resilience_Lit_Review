The aim of this study is to examine threats related to informal fish vending business among urban-based women and to propose strategies for overcoming the threats. Specifically, the study ascertains the threats associated with the fishing business and strategies for coping and the capacity to cope. Based on the multi-layered social resilience framework, this study used a qualitative design and a sample size of 30 participants obtained both randomly and purposively. The findings revealed that threats experienced by the vendors include stigma, fish scarcity, higher fish prices, inadequate business capital, various forms of gender-related violence such as sexual harassment, lack of legal status, and various forms of crime including robbery, theft, and pickpocketing. Findings further indicated that vendors managed to develop both reactive and proactive strategies for coping with the threats. Reactive strategies include joining small self-helping groups popularly known as Village Community Banking (VICOBA) and soliciting family and relative support against insecurity threats. Proactive strategies include securing business financing from credible institutions, business diversification and adopting new kinds of business, business registration and licensing, searching for and participating in education and capacity-building programs, as well as business advocacy. It is recommended that government support, provision of education, and access to credit, should be considered in supporting women fish vendors to cope with the threats in their fishing business activities.
