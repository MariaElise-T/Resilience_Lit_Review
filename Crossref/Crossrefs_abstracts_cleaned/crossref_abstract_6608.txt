Many children in the world grow up without good enough opportunities under challenging conditions such as poverty, violence, neglect, abuse, family discord and diseases. These conditions hinder the mental, emotional and social development of children and young people, making it difficult for them to reach their potential to become healthy adults. In addition to all these, there are children who can survive even in the most severe conditions and continue their development with health and functionality. Psychological resilience is a resource that protects and develops the psychological well-being of children and adolescents, rather than an invariable, innate feature, it is a dynamic process that can be developed, continuous and shaped by the interaction of the individual with his own internal factors and environmental factors. The aim of this study is to present a review of the literature on resilience research from past to present. The article includes the definition of resilience, the history of resilience research, components of resilience, models, measurement, interventions, and future directions in resilience research. Investments in the development of resilience in children and adolescents will produce health-promoting outcomes that balance individual and community-based psychological well-being throughout life, including positive outcomes and potential improvements.
