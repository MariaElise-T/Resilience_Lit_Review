This paper studies resilient coordinated control over networks with hybrid dynamics and malicious agents. In a hybrid multi‐agent system, continuous‐time and discrete‐time agents concurrently exist and communicate through local interaction. We introduce the notion of heterogeneous robustness to capture the topological structure and facilitate convergence analysis of hybrid agents over multiple subnetworks, where the exact number and identities of malicious agents are not known. A hybrid resilient strategy is first designed to ensure group consensus of the heterogeneously robust network admitting completely distributed implementation. We then develop a scaled consensus protocol which allows different clusters within each subnetwork, providing further flexibility over the resilient control tasks. Finally, some numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.
