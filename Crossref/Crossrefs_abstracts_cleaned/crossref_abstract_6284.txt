Drought resiliency strategies combine developmental, physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms. Here, we compare drought responses in two resilient spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes: a well-studied drought-resilient Drysdale and a resilient genotype from the US Pacific North-West Hollis. While both genotypes utilize higher water use efficiency through the reduction of stomatal conductance, other mechanisms differ. First, Hollis deploys the drought escape mechanism to a greater extent than Drysdale by accelerating the flowering time and reducing root growth. Second, Drysdale uses physiological mechanisms such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) to dissipate the excess of harvested light energy and sustain higher Fv/Fm and ϕPSII, whereas Hollis maintains constant NPQ but lower Fv/Fm and ϕPSII values. Furthermore, more electron donors of the electron transport chain are in the oxidized state in Hollis than in Drysdale. Third, many ROS homeostasis parameters, including peroxisome abundance, transcription of peroxisome biogenesis genes PEX11 and CAT, catalase protein level, and enzymatic activity, are higher in Hollis than in Drysdale. Fourth, transcription of autophagy flux marker ATG8.4 is upregulated to a greater degree in Hollis than in Drysdale under drought, whereas relative ATG8 protein abundance under drought stress is lower in Hollis than in Drysdale. These data demonstrate the activation of autophagy in both genotypes and a greater autophagic flux in Hollis. In conclusion, wheat varieties utilize different drought tolerance mechanisms. Combining these mechanisms within one genotype offers a promising strategy to advance crop resiliency.
