Abstract: This research aimed to investigate the relationship between infidelity and resilience among young adults in romantic relationships. The research included young adults aged 18-25 who were or had been in a romantic relationship, while excluding individuals outside this age range or those who had never been in a romantic relationship. Two scales were used to collect data: The Infidelity Scale, consisting of 35 items and developed by Logue et al. in 2010, and the Resilience Scale, consisting of 14 items and developed by Wagnild in 2009. The participants, totaling 120 individuals, were from the Delhi-NCR region. The research demonstrates that there is a significant relationship between infidelity and resilience among young adults in romantic relationships. It also reveals a significant difference in infidelity between males and females, with females exhibiting higher levels of infidelity. However, there was no significant difference in resilience between males and females in the context of romantic relationships. These findings suggest that infidelity may impact relationship quality and resilience differently for males and females
