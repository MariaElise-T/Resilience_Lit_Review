AbstractThis article studies the bipartite resilient event‐triggered consensus control for a class of the heterogeneous multi‐agent systems. Due to the external cyberattacks, some agents may become the Byzantine agents and will affect the behavior of the other agents. To improve the security of the multi‐agent systems against the Byzantine agents, a novel bipartite event‐triggered heterogeneous mean‐subsequence‐reduced algorithm is designed. First, to handle the heterogeneous multi‐agent systems, a state transformation is carefully designed, to facilitate the design and analysis of the bipartite resilient consensus algorithm. Based upon the designed state transformation, the bipartite resilient control inputs are constructed, where the structural balance analysis shows that the resulting effective signed graph and the equivalent signed graph are both structurally balanced, if the signed graph of the multi‐agent systems is structurally balanced. In addition, a dynamic event‐triggered mechanism is proposed, where a set of dynamic factors are introduced into the event‐triggered functions to prevent the usage of the global topology information. By virtue of the designed algorithm, it is guaranteed that the heterogeneous multi‐agent systems can achieve the bipartite consensus in the presence of the Byzantine agents, and the communication burden among the agents can be reduced. The numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
