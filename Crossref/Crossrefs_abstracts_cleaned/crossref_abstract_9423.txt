Ice disasters have frequently occurred worldwide in recent years, which seriously affected power transmission system operations. To improve the resilience of power grids and minimize economic losses, this paper proposes a framework for assessing the influence of ice disasters on the resilience of power transmission systems. This method considers the spatialâ€“temporal impact of ice disasters on the resilience of power transmission systems, and the contingence set for risk assessment is established according to contingency probabilities. Based on meteorological data, the outage models of power transmission components are developed in the form of generic fragility curves, and the ice load is given by a simplified freezing rain ice model. A cell partition method is adopted to analyze the way ice disasters affect the operation of power transmission systems. The sequential Monte Carlo simulation method is used to assess resilience for capturing the stochastic impact of ice disasters and deriving the contingency set. Finally, the IEEE RTS-79 system is employed to investigate the impact of ice disasters by two case studies, which demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed framework. In turn, the results help recognize the resilience of the system under such disasters and the effects of different resilience enhancement measures.
