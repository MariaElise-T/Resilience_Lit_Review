AbstractObjectivesResilience is the ability to bounce back or recover from major life stressors. The aim of this study was to investigate resilience in dental students and how it may or may not vary across demographic characteristics such as gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, self‐reported health, and parental educational level.MethodsData were collected from 151 dental students at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Dentistry with an anonymous survey that included the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and various demographic variables. Associations between RSA and variables of interest were assessed using linear models.ResultsDental students demonstrated relatively high levels of resilience. Resilience was significantly associated with gender (with females showing more resilience than males (P = 0.0395)), race (P = 0.0025), overall health (P = 0.0101), and mental health (P < 0.0001). Results from Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) supported a 5‐factor solution that explained 82.6% of the variability of resilience in the sample of dental students. The 5 factors were nearly identical to the 5 subscales originally described by the RSA demonstrating validity in this population. Overall health ratings were significantly related to resilience, suggesting that perceived resilience in dental students may protect against negative health outcomes. This study can inform internal and external support systems of dental students as well as institutional programmatic development to better support their educational experiences.
