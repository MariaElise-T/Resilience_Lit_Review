The dynamic nature of resilience necessitates that children from high-risk backgrounds who

are functioning adaptively despite experiences of adversity must be examined over time. In the

current investigation, the adaptation of school-age maltreated and nonmaltreated

socioeconomically disadvantaged children was examined over 3 consecutive years. In accord

with predictions, a higher percentage of nonmaltreated children than of maltreated children were

found to be resilient. Moreover, a higher percentage of maltreated than of nonmaltreated children

were shown to exhibit functioning consistently in the low adaptive range. Differential predictors

of resilience were found in maltreated and nonmaltreated children. Specifically, for maltreated

children, positive self-esteem, ego resilience, and ego overcontrol predicted resilient functioning,

whereas relationship features were more influential for nonmaltreated children. These findings

are discussed in relation to the unfolding of resilient self-organizational strivings in maltreated

and nonmaltreated children.
