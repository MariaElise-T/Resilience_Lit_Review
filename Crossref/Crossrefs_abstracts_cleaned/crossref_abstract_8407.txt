 From a project management perspective, coping with the negative consequences of disruptions is considered a great challenge. This article aims to present the concept of project resilience and to validate, through quantitative analysis, the indicators that were developed by Rahi et al. (2019) to assess its two key dimensions: awareness and adaptive capacity. As a result of this exploratory research, eight indicators composed of 29 items that measure IT project resilience were retained. Future research, as part of the scale development process, is needed to make the project resilience scale more robust and accurate.
