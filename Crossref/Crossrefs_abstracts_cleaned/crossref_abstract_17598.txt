It is of practical significance for rural revitalization to clarify the gap in resilience development among different rural areas and improve the ability to cope with external interference. Combined with the strategic policy of rural revitalization in China, the evaluation index system of rural comprehensive resilience was constructed from the five dimensions of productive resilience, ecological resilience, social resilience, institutional resilience, and economic resilience. The advantages and disadvantages of rural development are determined based on a quantitative evaluation of the comprehensive resilience of rural development. This could provide a reference for decision making in rural development. This study uses the rural statistical data of nine cities (prefectures) in Jilin Province in 2019 and 2020 as an example as well as the entropy weight method to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on rural resilience development. The results showed that the pandemic situation has an obvious impact on rural economic resilience; rural areas with high ecological resilience have a strong ability to cope with the panidemic situation; and rural areas with excellent ecological environment resources have strong comprehensive resilience.
