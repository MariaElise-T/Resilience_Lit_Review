AbstractThis community‐based study explored resilience practices among people living with physical disabilities (i.e., stroke, spinal cord injury, and other physical disabilities) during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In this photo elicitation study, during 1:1 interviews, participants shared and described photos that reflected their pandemic‐related experiences. Data were analyzed thematically to identify resilience‐related practices. Our analysis revealed three themes: (1) reflecting on the importance of family, friends, and community (e.g., recalling past memories and strengthening existing connections); (2) engaging in social and recreational activities (e.g., experiencing the outdoors and gardening); and (3) reframing personal contexts and social environment (e.g., adjusting to new social norms and overcoming physical barriers to navigating safely during the pandemic). The resilience that participants identified encompassed not only individual strategies but also family and community supports. Resilience can be fostered through community initiatives that support more equitable responses to health emergencies for people with disabilities.
