To adapt to the emergent global climate impacts, the local communities of Khulna, Satkhira and Bagerhat districts in South-Western Bangladesh have spontaneously promoted a number of social innovation using their innovative ideas and traditional knowledge. The present study highlights on this practice called as Community Mangrove Aqua-Silvi-Culture (CMAS) to cultivate some floral and faunal species of the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem. CMAS is a plot of swampy land with 1 to 1.5 feet deep water bordered by a dyke of 0.5 to1.5 feet height from the water level. The mangrove plant species in CMAS includes Goalpata (Nypa fruticans), Goran (Ceriops tagal), Keora (Sonnerata species), Hargoza (Alanthus ilicifolius), and Baen (Avicennia Species). Besides, there is a canal of about 2-2.5 feet depth that runs along the farm dykes where fish (Telapia, Vetki, Amadi, Tengra, Carps), shrimp (Bagda) and crabs are cultured. For in depth analysis of CMAS, face-to-face interview was conducted in 18 CMAS farms to know about the cultivation method, cost-benefit aspects, environmental and social impact of this unique culture. The farm owners opined that after 13 to 14 months of plantation, which is the shortest in comparison with traditional practice, Golpata and Goran can be harvested usually in January to February. On the other hand, farming seasonality of fish and shrimps varies species to species. However, most of the fish species can be harvested in between May to June in each year. Interestingly, CMAS culture doesn’t need much care and maintenance costs. It is expected that the detailed analysis of CMAS will help the Sundarbans depended local communities more climate resilient.
