AbstractResilience is a key characteristic to study in families, particularly those who have experienced significant systemic risk factors. While much resilience research focuses on ethnic and cultural minorities, little research focuses specifically on American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) families. The parent–child relationship has been demonstrated to be a key characteristic in families, and this relationship may also serve as a protective factor for AI/AN families. Positive parent–child relationships are consistently linked to positive child outcomes, and parental psychological symptoms are linked with child psychological symptoms in non‐Native families. These associations warrant further examination among AI/AN families. We hypothesized that the parent–child relationship would moderate the link between parent distress (i.e., depressive and anxious symptoms) and child internalizing problems in a sample of 57 AI/AN parents of children 3–5 years of age. As expected, the parent–child relationship moderated the associations between parent anxiety symptoms and child internalizing symptoms, and between parent depressive symptoms and child internalizing symptoms. Furthermore, the strength of the parent–child relationship buffered the effects of parent distress on child internalizing symptoms. Results highlight the potentially protective role of strong parent–child relationships in AI/AN families.
