INTRODUCTION:
The prevalence of burnout among US physicians is estimated to be 40-60%, which is higher than in workers in other fields. Additionally, obstetricians and gynecologists have one of the lowest resiliency scores compared to other medical specialties.


METHODS:
For the 2021-2022 academic year, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Walter Reed) obstetrics and gynecology residents were divided into the four Hogwarts houses to take part in a year-long competition called the House Cup, during which they participate in monthly wellness challenges to earn points for their team. Additionally, residents are awarded points by demonstrating clinical excellence and outstanding work ethic. Quantitative data and qualitative feedback will be collected throughout the year to assess for feelings of wellness, burnout, and resiliency as well as academic participation.


RESULTS:
In a preintervention 2020 survey of Walter Reed obstetrics and gynecology residents, only 66% of residents believed our program had a culture of wellness. Interim data from a recent resident survey, with a response rate of 93.3% (14 of 15), showed that 84.7% (12 of 14) of residents believed our program has a culture of wellness, notably improved from last year. Additionally, 84.7% (12 of 14) of residents believed the House Cup has improved their resiliency, and 100% (14/14) of residents believed the House Cup has a positive impact on the program.


CONCLUSION:
Initial response to the House Cup competition has been overwhelmingly positive with residents reporting increased feelings of wellness and improved resiliency. Our goal is to create a sustainable, easy-to-implement initiative to improve resident wellness and resiliency not only at our program but across the country and across specialties.
