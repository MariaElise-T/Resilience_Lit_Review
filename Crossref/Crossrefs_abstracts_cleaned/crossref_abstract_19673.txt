Background: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the world's socio-economic structure must adjust to operate within the new normal for each country for its citizens to survive. Many jobs are now operating online, which has changed regular workers into “digital workers”. The abrupt shift in the nature of work has caused pandemic-related stress among workers and raises the question - can these digital workers thrive during the pandemic? The study aims to evaluate pandemic-related stress faced by digital workers and their resilience and ability to thrive during the pandemic.  Methods: A qualitative research methodology in the form of a thematic approach was used to gauge digital workers’ pandemic-related stressors and resilience strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 digital workers from various backgrounds were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire.  Results: Five themes were identified as the pandemic-related stressors among digital workers. These include anxiety about COVID-19 infections, mental exhaustion, physical exhaustion, feeling insecure and uncertain about financial concerns. The resilience factors include an active approach towards problem-solving, a positive outlook even during suffering, staying focused on responsibility for others, managing  one’s well-being and a strong reliance on faith.  Conclusions: The outcomes of the study were derived from the culmination of a qualitative approach that comprehended the feelings, ideas, and experiences of digital workers. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a quantitative analysis in order to test the hypotheses and assumptions of the study.
