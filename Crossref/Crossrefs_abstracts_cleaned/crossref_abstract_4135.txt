Resilience was a concept introduced in the study of responses and
                        positive adaptation of people living in risky environments, contexts and
                        situations that posed potential threats to normal development like poverty,
                        disease and violence. Subsequently introduced in the study of developmental
                        phenomena and processes that occur in all ages and stages of the life cycle,
                        including the later stages. The resilience´s perspective has modified the
                        previous model of aging that associated losses with a more comprehensive in
                        that people have high levels of positive functioning, despite adverse
                        circumstances, limitations and impairments. This conception is convergent
                        with the approach of resilience and the idea that a resilient person is
                        normal, isn´t exceptional. Two psychobiological processes support
                        psychological resilience in old age: neuroplasticity and
                        psychoneuroimmunology. To finish, are highlighted the personal resources and
                        requirements called resilient contributing to successful aging, including
                        longevity.
