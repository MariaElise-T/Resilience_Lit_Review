Moroccan cooperatives and like any other economic actors have suffered adverse repercussions from the health crisis, mainly in terms of sales volumes following the measures imposed by Morocco to stem the spread of the Coronavirus, such as the ban on gatherings, which has complicated the situation of the cooperatives which have found themselves faced with the difficulty of promoting and selling their products knowing that their practices for selling them revolve around gatherings, namely trade fairs and other ways such as "Dlala". Persuaded by the importance of digital, cooperatives have opted for digital transformation, namely online sales, as an adequate solution to the health situation. In this regard, this work aims to assess the role of the digital transformation of the sales process in the resilience of cooperatives in the face of the health crisis. To do this, we adopted an approach of exploring the case of the cooperatives through a field survey conducted in May 2022 at the level of the BZOU commune / Province of Azilal. The population studied is composed of fifteen (15) cooperatives, meaning 50 members/employees an average.
