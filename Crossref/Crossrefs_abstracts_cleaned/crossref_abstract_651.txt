ABSTRACT
As part of the Deepwater Horizon Medical Settlement, the University of South Alabama's Coastal Resource & Resiliency Center is charged with preparing Community Health Workers (CHWs) to serve in areas affected by the oil spill. The immediate objective of this effort is to enhance primary and behavioral healthcare capacity and health literacy, especially among disadvantaged and underserved populations. A review of previous research confirms the utility of CHWs in accomplishing this objective. Findings further suggest that CHWs could play a crucial role in the area of oil spill response and recovery, but fulfilling this role will require appropriate training. In this paper, we provide an outline of CHW training that includes: 1) educational outreach to enhance literacy and promote preparedness; 2) identification and management of diseases and conditions associated with or exacerbated by such technological disasters; and 3) essential elements in the recognition and referral of psychosocial problems associated with the oil spill experience. Community Health Workers have great potential to contribute in the area of oil spill response and recovery by motivating maximum preparedness, speeding recovery, and increasing resiliency for future spills. It is important that institutional actors involved in the area recognize this potential and contribute to its realization.
