Abstract
The manufacturing process is an important factor related to the compression-resilience performance of corrugated metal gaskets, especially stainless steel gaskets. A finite element method was employed to research the mechanical properties of corrugated metal gasket based on the stamping and spring back process analysis. On this basis, the influence of structural parameters of corrugated metal gasket related to the mechanical properties was analyzed. Prediction models of mechanical properties were proposed and validated in this paper. The result shows that the maximum contact stress and resilience rate in the finite element model are in accordance with the experimental results with the relative error of 1.21% and 8.76%, respectively. Critical structural parameters affecting the properties of the corrugated metal gasket are pitch (P), lip height (H), and material thickness (T). The compression and resilience curves obtained from the prediction models are consistent with the finite element method (FEM) simulation. The models can accurately reflect the compression-resilience performance of corrugated metal gaskets with different structural parameters.
