Herbal infusions (HI) are a popular type of beverage known for their potential health benefits due to the extraction of phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is a well-known dietary pattern with beneficial effects on health, and Psychological Resilience (PsyR) is a key indicator of mental health and human well-being. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relationship between HI and the MD, as well as their association with PsyR. The study included 398 healthy adults from Greece who participated voluntarily in an online research survey. The results indicated that 45.9% of participants consumed HI more than twice per week. There was a statistically significant association between the weekly consumption of HI and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (14-MEDAS), which identified HI consumption as a prognostic factor of high adherence to the MD. Additionally, HI consumption was significantly associated with PsyR. St Johnâ€™s wort, green tea, and Greek mountain tea were associated with higher levels of PsyR. Greek mountain tea was also associated with a healthful and sustainable lifestyle. These findings suggest that HI are an integral part of the Mediterranean Diet, and their consumption is associated with PsyR. Promoting the consumption of HI such as Greek mountain tea and other herbs could be an effective way to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and sustainable practices. Further randomized control trials are needed to confirm the results of this study.
