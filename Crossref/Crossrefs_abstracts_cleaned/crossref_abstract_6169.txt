This paper provides details of a government funded national Values Education and Student Wellbeing Schools Project, implemented in Canberra, Australia. The Project focuses on student wellbeing and values education through curriculum implementation and staff development across early childhood, primary and secondary sectors. It comprises two stages: Stage 1. School-based project implementation and reporting of evidence related to the aims of the key objectives; and Stage 2. Research and evaluation conducted by university research teams on the impact of Stage 1 to provide an evidence base for further developing a whole school approach to values education, student wellbeing, resilience and positive education. The collaborative processes, development and findings from the Stage 2 research component form the basis of this paper and provided valuable information as the research proceeded. Mixed methodologies were adopted to capture the richness and impact of the work being conducted in schools. Data collected from ten schools saw the emergence of a number of themes and outcomes that highlighted the positive impact of the Project on teachers, students and the school culture and community. The findings of the study highlight the importance of a whole school approach to values education in promoting positive change in schools and student wellbeing through quality pedagogy and curriculum, increased opportunities for student participation and leadership and establishment of stronger school-community engagement.
