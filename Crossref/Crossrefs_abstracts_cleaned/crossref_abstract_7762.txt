A rebound resilience apparatus was developed to study the dynamic mechanical properties of polymeric materials from −196 to +180°C. Resilience data at a frequency of about 3500 Hz are obtained by measuring ball velocity near the sample with a photoelectric device. Frequency of impact is estimated using a microphone pickup. The results are recorded automatically with a data acquisition system designed for the test. The apparatus is virtually automatic in operation and has wide flexibility in sample configuration, temperature range, and temperature control. The results can be related to other dynamic mechanical properties data, and estimates of Young's modulus in the regions of high resilience can be made.
