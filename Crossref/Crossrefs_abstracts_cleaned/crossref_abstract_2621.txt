This paper derives expressions for the sound pressure due to free-space resilient and rigid disks using a spherical harmonic expansion. A method is derived for improving the convergence and reducing the error of the expansions for radii less than the disk radius. Low-frequency approximations are also derived which simplify calculation at low frequencies. The results are verified by comparison with numerical solutions and the error is compared with existing paraxial solutions.
