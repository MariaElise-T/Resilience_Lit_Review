The huge benefit of mobile application industry has attracted a large number of developers and attendant attackers. Application repackaging provides help for the distribution of most Android malware. It is a serious threat to the entire Android ecosystem, as it not only compromises the security and privacy of the app users but also plunders app developers’ income. Although massive approaches have been proposed to address this issue, plagiarists try to fight back through packing their malicious code with the help of commercial packers. Previous works either do not consider the packing issue or rely on time-consuming computations, which are not scalable for large-scale real-world scenario. In this paper, we propose FUIDroid, a novel two-phase app clones detection system that can detect the packed cloned app. FUIDroid includes a function-based fast selection phase to quickly select suspicious apps by analyzing apps’ description and a further UI-based accurate detection phase to refine the detection result. We evaluate our system on two sets of apps. The result from experiment on 320 packed samples demonstrates that FUIDroid is resilient to packed apps. The evaluation on more than 150,000 real-world apps shows the efficiency of FUIDroid in large-scale scenario.
