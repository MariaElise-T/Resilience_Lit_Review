Purpose
This study aims to examine contemporary research on organizational resilience and then propose an integrated dynamic model to study organizational resilience with a more inclusive concept and future research agenda developed.


Design/methodology/approach
This conceptual paper uses the literature review method to analyze and categorize current research on organizational resilience, and then based on the analysis of existing organizational resilience studies, this paper proposes an integrated model for a more inclusive and integrated concept of organizational resilience with refined future research directions.


Findings
A thorough analysis of current organizational resilience research shows that existing studies on organizational resilience have largely focused on isolated dimensions by treating organizational resilience as a state rather than a dynamic capability. This paper proposes that an integrated concept of organizational resilience consists of three dimensions including cognitive, behavioral and contextual resilience, and this dynamic capability should be examined from three different levels, including individual, group and organizational levels to better conceptualize organizational resilience and for better applicability in management practice.


Originality/value
The past decades have seen increasing interests in organizational resilience both from academic scholars and from management practitioners. However, research on this emerging field remains fragmented, and there is little consensus on the conceptualization of organizational resilience. This study contributes to the literature by thoroughly examining current research on organizational resilience and proposes an integrated dynamic model to study organizational resilience.
