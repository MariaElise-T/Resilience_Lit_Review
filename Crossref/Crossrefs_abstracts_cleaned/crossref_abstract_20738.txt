Resilience, the ability of a system to withstand disruptions and quickly return to a normal state, is essential for a low-Earth-orbit satellite communication system (LEO-SCS), as its large number of satellites, may encounter various disturbances. As a developing system with asymmetrical and insufficient data, it is with both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, which renders existing resilience measures inapplicable. This paper utilizes uncertainty theory to define belief instantaneous availability, based on which a new resilience measure for the LEO-SCS is proposed. As the resilience is mainly determined by the dynamic and uncertain characteristics of an LEO-SCS, an uncertain satellite network evolution model is developed to describe its operating patterns, and an evaluation method is proposed to estimate its resilience. To illustrate our proposed uncertain theory-based resilience evaluation method, an LEO-SCS case with 48 satellites is studied, and its resilience values under different backup strategies are compared to assist in system design decisions.
