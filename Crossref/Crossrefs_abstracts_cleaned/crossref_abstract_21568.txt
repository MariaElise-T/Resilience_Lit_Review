AbstractAimsThe aim of this research was to explore factors affecting the well‐being and resilience of healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID‐19.DesignQualitative content analysis of survey responses to a single, open‐ended question.MethodsThe study took place in June and July 2020 in the Mid‐Atlantic United States. Qualitative data from 452 HCWs were analysed with deductive content analysis, using a National Academy of Medicine model of factors affecting clinician well‐being and resilience. The study is reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research.FindingsThe findings reflect each of the seven domains of the National Academy of Medicine model, demonstrating the diverse factors that have impacted the well‐being and resilience of HCWs during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The results of the study show that factors within the workplace have significantly impacted the well‐being and resilience of HCWs during the pandemic, in particular, the practice environment and the rules and regulations implemented by healthcare organizations. At the same time, individual and even societal factors have also affected well‐being during the pandemic, but not to the same degree as factors within the workplace.ConclusionThe research findings illustrate how multiple, diverse factors have influenced the well‐being and resilience of HCWs during the pandemic. The study has practical relevance for healthcare leaders and important implications for future research.ImpactHealth system leaders can address the well‐being and resilience of healthcare workers by implementing solutions that address health system factors like the practice environment and the policies and procedures of the organization. Researchers should not only focus on individual factors associated with professional well‐being but must also expand research and interventional studies to include the system and environmental factors that significantly affect clinicians.
