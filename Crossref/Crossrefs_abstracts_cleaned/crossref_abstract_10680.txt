AbstractA society needs mature and confident nurse practitioners, who are able to think analytically and flexibly, recognize needs for further preparation, and willing to engage in self‐development. Concern is raised regarding how educators will build the capacity of resilient students with a knowledge base and a minimum set of skills in responding to various issues and for engaging in self‐reflection. Drawing on the framework of nursing competencies and global standards for the education of professional nurses, resilient students may contribute through their social competence, problem‐solving ability, sense of purpose, and persistence in the process to achieve the goal of the project. Educators should know how to build the resilient attribute in students by encouraging them to engage in self‐reflection. This article discusses four areas that help students build resilience from project‐based learning of a small group: the impact of problem‐based learning at clinical practice, project/problem‐based learning, resilient nursing student, and developing nursing students' resilience. Self‐assessment to check the promoting skills for teaching in a problem‐based learning program helps the faculty holding the empowerment to encourage or support the students to face the challenge within the small team.
