➤ Resilience is a dynamic psychological construct that refers to the ability to adapt and improve when facing adversity or other stressors.➤ Recent investigations in various orthopaedic subspecialties have demonstrated that resilience may contribute to favorable mental health and physical function after a surgical procedure.➤ More research, using well-designed prospective studies, is necessary to better define the role that resilience and other factors play in the health and outcomes of patients with orthopaedic conditions.➤ Orthopaedic surgeons can consider incorporating resilience assessments into their practices to aid in identifying patients who will do well with a surgical procedure and those who may benefit from specialized therapy to optimize their health and function.
