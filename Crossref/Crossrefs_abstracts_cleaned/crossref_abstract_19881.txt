Germany nowadays is known as one of the most robust economies in Europe. Yet, at the beginning of 20th Century Germany, poverty became a severe problem that caused a social and cultural impact on the children. Positive self-esteem and resiliency in children were needed to cope with the situation. The roman titled PÃ¼nktchen und Anton, written in 1931 by Erich KÃ¤stner, describes the childrenâ€™s life in Berlin dealt with the poverty problem.Â  This research aims to see how self-esteem and resiliency in children described as a life tool for the first figure (Anton) who classified as an adversity child in the novel. This question is answered by using descriptive qualitative method and self-esteem theory by Nathaniel Branden.Â  The result shows there is advocacy in describing a marginalized Anton to become a hero thank to his positive self-esteem (self-efficacy and self-respect). His positive self-esteem builts him to be resilient.
