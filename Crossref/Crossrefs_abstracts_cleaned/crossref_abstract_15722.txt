Research into supporting children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) has primarily focused on risk factors and deficit-based interventions. Studies are beginning to highlight the importance of protective factors that mitigate risks of SLCN, including supportive school environments that foster resilience. Teacher efficacy is an important consideration in fostering supportive environments for children. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the impact of short-term solution focused group SLCN coaching on teacher efficacy. The research employed a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group design. Sixty-two primary school teachers participated in the study, of which 37 attended a two-sessional solution focused coaching intervention and a non-equivalent control group consisted of 25 teachers. Measures of teacher efficacy were obtained pre- and post-intervention. The paired sample t-test results demonstrated an increase in student engagement in the intervention group compared to the control group, but not for overall efficacy score and instructional strategies/classroom management. No statistically significant differences were found in the control group. Coaching teachers to identify strengths, resources and whatâ€™s already working for children with SLCN fosters a more holistic, resilience-oriented focus and facilitates student engagement.
