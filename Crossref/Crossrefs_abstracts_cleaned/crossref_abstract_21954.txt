 Evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) applications on smartphones are a cost-effective way for employees to take proactive steps to improve well-being and performance. However, little is known about what sustains engagement on these applications and whether they could dynamically improve occupational outcomes such as resilience and mood. Using real-world data, this intensive longitudinal study examines (a) which employees would continually engage with a cognitive behavioural therapy-informed mHealth application (‘Intellect’); and (b) if daily engagement of ‘Intellect’ would relate to better occupational outcomes on the following day. A total of 515 working adults in Singapore and Hong Kong ( Mage = 32.4, SDage = 8.17) completed daily in-app items on mood and resilience components (i.e. sleep hours, sleep quality, physical activity, and stress levels). Our results revealed that employees with lower baseline resilience (β = −0.048, odds ratio (OR) = 0.953, p < 0.01), specifically poorer sleep quality (β = −0.212, OR = 0.809, p = 0.001) and/or higher stress levels (β = −0.255, OR = 0.775, p = 0.05), were more likely to resume engagement on the application. Among the 150 active users (i.e. ≥3 consecutive days of engagement) ( Mage = 32.2, SDage = 8.17), daily engagement predicted higher resilience (β = 0.122; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.039–0.206), specifically lower stress levels (β = 0.018; 95% CI 0.004–0.032), higher physical activity (β = 0.079; 95% CI 0.032–0.126), and mood levels (β = 0.020; 95% CI 0.012–0.029) on the following day even after controlling for same-day outcomes. Our preliminary findings suggest that engaging with a mHealth application was associated with higher dynamic resilience and emotional well-being in employees.
