This paper will provide the reader with a planning and engineering framework that addresses a broad range of dynamic coastal issues which are increasingly exacerbated by climate change. The exploration of our recent work in Charleston, South Carolina, will demonstrate how strategies can be implemented at a site-specific scale to tackle interconnected issues impacting community, infrastructure and environment. This will highlight the importance of how layered protection, ecological sensitivity, and holistic thinking to address coastal systems can facilitate innovative and thoughtful approaches to resilient coastal edge protection, resulting in effective long-term solutions that align with community character, robust ecosystems, and integrated infrastructure. Our involvement in a wide range of sea level rise projects has highlighted core principles to achieve coastal resilience. These include the need for rigorous site analysis to identify vulnerable communities and services, and proactive development of solutions to mitigate projected threats while supporting critical stormwater and transportation infrastructure. The goal is to prepare for the future without undermining current economic opportunity, quality of life, and connection to waterfronts.
