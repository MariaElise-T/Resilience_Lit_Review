Although research has explored the effects of protective factors on fostering resiliency within individuals, the same level of inquiry has not emerged investigating the causes of why high-risk organizations are resilient to serious violent delinquency. One type of organization that seems particular appropriate for research inquiry is the school. Using a sample of 307 school principals from the School Survey on Crime and Safety, this study investigates how protective factors are individually and cumulatively related to resiliency against serious violence within schools. The findings indicate schools may be more reactive than proactive in their efforts to remain resilient. The theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed.
