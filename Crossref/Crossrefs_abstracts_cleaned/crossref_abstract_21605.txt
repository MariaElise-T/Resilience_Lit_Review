Listing potential species for restoring areas has become a complex task considering the lack of information regarding the silvicultural behavior of native trees after planting and their responses to environmental conditions. Frost is an important meteorological phenomenon that regulates the distribution of plant species, especially in subtropical regions. Thus, we evaluated the effect of frost and the resilience potential of native forest species in restoration planting of a riparian forest in southern Brazil. The experimental design used was randomized blocks in a 6 × 2 factorial scheme (6 species and 2 containers). During the winter in 2014 (270 days after planting), the damage from the impact of frost was assessed through a rating scale ranging from 0 (100% of the leaf area and damaged stem) to 10 (no visual damage). In addition, to assess species resilience, the height and stem diameter were measured, prior to the winter of 2014 and at 270 and 360 days. Eugenia involucrata and Schinus terebinthifolius were considered frost tolerant species. Parapiptadenia rigida was classified as moderately frost tolerant, while Casearia sylvestris, Cupania vernalis, and Inga vera were very sensitive to frost. Casearia sylvestris, E. involucrata, P. rigida, and S. terebinthifolius showed potential for recommencement of growth. On the other hand, C. vernalis and I. vera were considered too sensitive to frost, with high mortality rates and/or no resilience potential.
