Abstract
We examined relevance of the key constructs of the stress and resilience framework in the urban Indian context. Analyses of interviews with urban Indian mothers (N = 47) of a 3â€“6 year old child with intellectual disability generated themes on maternal appraisals of the child's disability, perceived stressors, and resources. Mothers seemed to utilize a combination of fact-based and religious explanation to make sense of their child's disability. Parental stressors ranged from child-related factors (diagnosis, behavioral problems) to financial and family-level challenges. However, participants also reported a number of personal, family-level, and societal resources that helped them cope with the stressors. Study findings are discussed in the context of implications for practice, policy, and research.
