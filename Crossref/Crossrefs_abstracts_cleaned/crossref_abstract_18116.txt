AbstractPost‐traumatic stress levels and factors influencing the sexual abuse period may differ between victims. This cross‐sectional study conducted a secondary analysis of primary online survey data extracted from a previous study. We examined the extent of trauma (types, timing) and depression, pain, resilience, and social support associated with post‐traumatic stress affecting the post‐traumatic stress percentile. Among 3000 adults aged 19–65 years, 1223 adults experienced childhood sexual abuse, adulthood sexual abuse, or childhood and adulthood sexual abuse. We conducted descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression, and simultaneous quantile regression. Quantile regression analysis showed the 80th percentile groups in childhood sexual abuse, education, depression, and social support were significantly associated with post‐traumatic stress. Depression was significantly and positively associated with post‐traumatic stress. Resilience was significantly and negatively associated with post‐traumatic stress in adulthood sexual abuse victims. Depression and pain were significantly and positively associated with post‐traumatic stress in childhood and adulthood sexual abuse victims. Post‐traumatic stress severity and influencing factors differed according to victims' age when the sexual abuse occurred, implying interventions should be tailored to each victim's post‐traumatic stress level.
