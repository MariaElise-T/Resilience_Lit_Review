In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the Rebuild by Design competition was born to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration and resilience planning in coastal and flood protection design. The Living Breakwaters project is a layered resilience approach to promote risk reduction, enhance ecosystems, and foster social resilience. Following the competition, the project was awarded $60 million by HUD (US Department of Housing and Urban Development) in June 2013. It is currently in final design and permitting with construction anticipated to begin the summer of 2019. The Living Breakwaters Project is a unique design of an offshore breakwater system to promote coastal resilience in Tottenville, Staten Island, New York. It combines physical risk reduction through wave attenuation and erosion prevention functions with ecological enhancement and habitat creation as an integrated part of the design. This paper explores the modeling and design of these unique coastal engineering and ecological structures.
