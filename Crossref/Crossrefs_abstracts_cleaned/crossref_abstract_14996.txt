Abstract
This article examines the impact of the large-scale Upper Cisokan Pumped Storage Hydropower (UCPSH) development project, in West Java, Indonesia on household livelihoods. The process of land acquisition and resettlement has taken away land-based resources that are the source of livelihood for households in 4 villages around the project. This article discusses how the resilience of household livelihoods occurs 5 years after land acquisition and resettlement. This study was conducted by interviewing 134 households affected by land acquisition and resettlement living in the vicinity of the UCPSH project site. The level of severity is studied to see how the household can respond to disturbances. Livelihood resilience in affected households occurs when the householdâ€™s livelihood system can absorb disturbances, then responds by re-establishing livelihood capital and assets. Livelihood strategies are carried out based on the capacity possessed to maintain and improve the quality of life. As a result, there are two livelihood strategies carried out by the affected households, the agricultural intensification strategy has improved 9% of living conditions and the livelihood diversification strategy has improved 2.5% of living conditions.
