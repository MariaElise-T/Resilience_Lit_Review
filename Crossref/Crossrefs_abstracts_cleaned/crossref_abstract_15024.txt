This study compared predictors of active coping (people's tendency to actively cope with stress) among college students in the United States and Taiwan. In both samples, trait resilience predicted active coping and mediated the effect of self‚Äêefficacy on active coping. The findings indicate that trait resilience influences college students' active coping with stress, regardless of their cultural backgrounds. Implications on how to help college students enhance trait resilience are discussed.
