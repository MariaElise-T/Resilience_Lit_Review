Abstract
The presence of thematic villages in cities in Indonesia has increasingly sprung up and become one of the important programs to increase tourism by the local government. The existence of urban thematic villages is in densely populated areas, where the theme raised on average focuses on visual and spatial storytelling. With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting on the decline in tourist interest, the existence of resilient villages where the creation of a safe and comfortable ecosystem for activities for visitors and villagers has become a priority. This underlies the importance of the existence of a standard guide to create a healthy spatial environment in a densely populated residential area. This research was conducted to be able to find the model, so that it can be an early guide in the presence of a healthy and comfortable thematic village in the pandemic era. This research was conducted using the case study of Kampung Pradah Surabaya, with qualitative methodology using literature studies and design modelling. The goal of this are that this pilot research can be a foundation in the development of thematically covid healthy areas by using sustainable community housing concept.
