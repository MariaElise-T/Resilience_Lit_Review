This article examines the relationship between teacher efficacy, leadership, and how they intersect with complex and layered school system dynamics. Using the Listening Guide Method for Qualitative Inquiry (the Listening Guide, Gilligan, 1993), teacher interviews are examined, resulting in thematic expressions of resignation or resilience. These qualitative data revealed that effective classroom teachers can overcome the limitations of existing bureaucratic structures through resilience anchored in individual self-efficacy. Teacher resilience, anchored in demonstrated self-efficacy, played a major role in teachersâ€™ in-classroom experiences and ability to successfully navigate a complex and layered school system dynamics.
