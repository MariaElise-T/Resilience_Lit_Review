A stochastic reaction-diffusion model is studied on a networked support. In each patch of the network, two species are assumed to interact following a non-normal reaction scheme. When the interaction unit is replicated on a directed linear lattice, noise gets amplified via a self-consistent process, which we trace back to the degenerate spectrum of the embedding support. The same phenomenon holds when the system is bound to explore a quasidegenerate network. In this case, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, which governs species diffusion, accumulate over a limited portion of the complex plane. The larger the network, the more pronounced the amplification. Beyond a critical network size, a system deemed deterministically stable, hence resilient, can develop seemingly regular patterns in the concentration amount. Non-normality and quasidegenerate networks may, therefore, amplify the inherent stochasticity and so contribute to altering the perception of resilience, as quantified via conventional deterministic methods.
