Significance
Using network analysis of resting-state functional MRI data, we demonstrate that significant randomization of global network metrics, and greater resilience to targeted attack on network hubs, was replicably demonstrable in Chinese patients with schizophrenia, and was also demonstrated for the first time in their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives. These results support the hypothesis that functional networks are abnormally randomized and resilient in schizophrenia and indicate that network randomization/resilience may be an endophenotype, or marker of familial risk, for schizophrenia. We suggest that the greater randomization of the brain network endophenotype of schizophrenia may confer advantages in terms of greater resilience to pathological attack that may explain the selection and persistence of risk genes for schizophrenia in the general population.
