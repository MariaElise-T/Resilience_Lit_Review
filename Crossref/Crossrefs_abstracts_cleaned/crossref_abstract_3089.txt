 To prevent conflict and move away from fragility towards resilient societies, states increasingly adopt systematic efforts and institutionalised mechanisms to build the necessary capacities to manage conflict and promote peace. One such approach, ‘infrastructures for peace’, offers an inclusive and respectful response. This reflective essay describes the central features of infrastructures for peace and examines how they strengthen resilience within societies. It provides examples of such structures that are being supported by the United Nations Development Programme and its national partners, and examines how they have contributed to national governance and transformed conflict situations.
