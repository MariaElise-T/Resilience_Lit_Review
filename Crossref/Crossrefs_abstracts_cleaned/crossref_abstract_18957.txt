There is an abundance of research that reveals our society’s stereotyping of older adults and the negative cultural images of the process of ageing (DeMuth, 2004; Fealy et al., 2012). These stereotypes–disinformations–that are attached to older individuals suggest that as we age, we enter a stage of stagnation, decline, and decreased resilience. However, there is substantial evidence that as people age, they still maintain considerable adaptability, mental resilience, and overall well being (Friedan, 1993, as cited in DeMuth, 2004). Rise, Shine, Sing! is a weekly online research-creation program that investigates how music, dance, and theatre can affect and contribute to the resilience and wellbeing of older adults. Through our work as research assistants on this project, we have observed the leaps and limitations of music theatre participants within our research community. Drawing from our experiences with the program, and reflecting upon our positionality in our research contexts, we will explore the ways in which misinformation and disinformation affect older individuals and the limitations placed on them by both society and themselves. Specifically, we will confront the stereotypes associated with older adulthood, the ageism present in the theatre industry, and resilience through the ageing process. At the same time, we will examine the ways that intergenerational communities, the importance of pursuing new passions, and creating opportunities to be expressive can enhance the lives and PERMA wellbeing of older adults. Our collective research and work with Rise, Shine, Sing! suggests that older adulthood can be a time of vibrancy, creativity, and increased agency.
