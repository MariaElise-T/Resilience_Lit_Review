In high school students’ anxiety is very common problem for all. Nevertheless, the students predict to be stressful increasing with several sources of stress especially with Academic stress. How to respond to stress and challenges affect the entire life of them. The current study tries to investigate the relationship between resilience and personality traits. Moreover, the other important objective is to examine whether big five personality traits predict resilience of high school female students or not. Till now, very limited studies have been conducted in India in context to high school female students. Enrolled in academic session 2020-21, 85 students studying Humanities in 12th standard, in GGSSS, Delhi, India were selected to participate in the study. The standardized questionnaires of the Ego Resilience Scale and Big Five Personality Test were used as the tool of the study. The data was collected using both the questionnaires and interpreted using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression at a significance level p<0.05. As a result of analysis, Pearson Correlation shows that all the personality traits E, A, C, O have a significant positive correlation with Resilience (r= .539, r=.734, r=.792 and r=. 751 respectively) but N has a significant negative correlation with resilience (r=-.684). Furthermore, the results reveal a statistically significant relationship between the variables of Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness, and the participants’ resilience scores (R=.859, R2= .738, p<.05). These three personality traits together account for 73% of the total variance in resilience (F=75.94, p<.05). It is concluded that Understanding of the levels and relationship among Personalities and Resilience of adolescents can assist in predicting the performance level of the students and in future intervention programs can be developed accordingly for the students for a successful and satisfactory life.
