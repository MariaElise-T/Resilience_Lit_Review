Marginalized communities in Zimbabwe experience recurrent climate threats due to low-risk perception, lack of awareness, depletion of household assets, and marginalization from the mainstream economy. The Doma community has had their livelihoods undermined by recurrent droughts and floods perennially. The study analyzed the causes of vulnerability and evaluated approaches employed by CBO Focus in building community resilience to hazards in this community in Mbire district. A case study design was employed. Focus group discussions, interviews, and community hazard mapping were used as data collection tools during the assessment. Training, sports, theatre arts, and functional adult literacy approaches were used in building resilience to shocks. Village heads, community leaders and the ward councillor led the activities and discussions. The Doma community is reserved and rarely interacts with outsiders, thus ill-prepared for disasters. Risk perception is low, and they lack the literacy skills to process early warning alerts. Lack of household productive assets and poorly constructed dagga huts that are susceptible to floods increase their vulnerability. Their nomadic practices are limited by national parks and conservancies. This has led to a sedentary life with little agronomic skills. The community produced a draft disaster preparedness plan and has sought collaborations with stakeholders in addition to initiating resilience-building strategies. Scaling up agronomic training, accelerated non-farm economic activities and market linkages will improve resilience to hazards. The integration of traditional knowledge into CMDRR approaches will promote project sustainability and enhance community resilience. Government support through infrastructure development and drafting policies that will promote disaster preparedness is desirable.
