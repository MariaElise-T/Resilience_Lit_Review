The Philippines is the third most disaster prone country in the world, mainly due to its location and geographical context (Jha, 2018). This descriptive study ascertained the level of preparedness and resiliency in disaster management among the twenty - three (23) island schools-communities in the Municipality of Concepcion, Province of Iloilo, Philippines. Likewise, it determined the gaps and needs in disaster preparedness and resiliency building among the local residents. Results revealed that as an entire group and whether classified as to the type of school, school population, and school location, island schools-communities were “highly prepared” for disasters. Further, findings indicated that they also have a “high level of resiliency”.  These were validated by the participants’ claim that the values of “self-reliance” and “sense of community” enabled them to survive, thrive, and recover from disaster situations. The study has further shown the need to put up food and water supply shelters or storage facilities among the different island schools-communities.
