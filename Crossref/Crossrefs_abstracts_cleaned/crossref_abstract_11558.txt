This study aims to investigate the role of locus of control, resilience, gender, talent, on student academic achievement and the relationship between these variables. There were 550 students participated in the study who were grouped based on the focus locus of control both internally and externally. The research method used was factorial design analysis with the aim of investigating the correlation between locus of control variables, resilience, gender, IQ, and student academic achievement. Researchers used ANOVA to investigate the relationship between these variables. The results showed that the internal locus students had superior academic resilience and achievement than the external locus students. Students who focus on internal aspects (internal locus of control) are more resilient and better at overcoming difficulties. The female gender tends to have better resilience compared to males and intelligence or IQ greatly contributes to student resilience. In addition, student resilience also affects the ability to solve student academic challenges. The implication of this research is that teachers must develop resilience and internal focus during the learning process in order to obtain better academic achievement.
