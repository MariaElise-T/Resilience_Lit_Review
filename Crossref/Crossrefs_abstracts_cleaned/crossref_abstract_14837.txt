AbstractSmart cities do not exist without robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the case of the COVID-19 pandemicÂ shows, they can assist in combating the novel coronavirus and its effects, and preventing its spread. However, their deployment necessitate the most secure, safe, and efficient use. The purpose of this article is to address the regulatory framework for AI and robotics in the context of developing resilient organisations in smart cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study provides regulatory insights necessary to re-examine the strategic management of technology creation, dissemination, and application in smart cities, in order to address the issues regarding the strategic management of innovation policies nationally, regionally, and worldwide. To meet these goals, the article analyses government materials, such as strategies, policies, legislation, reports, and literature. It also juxtaposes materials and case studies, with the help of expert knowledge. The authors emphasise the imminent need for coordinated strategies to regulate AI and robots designed for improving digital and smart public health services globally.
