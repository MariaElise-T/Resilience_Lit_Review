 Psychopathy has been shown to be a risk factor for antisocial behavior, aggression, violence, and criminal offending. Elucidating the variables that predict the likelihood of psychopathy, therefore, is important. The current study used the risk and resiliency approach to test the possible risk and protective factors of primary psychopathy using a noninstitutionalized college-aged sample. Of particular interest, we tested the individual and cumulative risk of several defining features of emerging adulthood (assessed using the Inventory of the Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood measure), sex of participant, and trait mindfulness. Participants ( N = 822) from various colleges and universities in the United States completed questionnaires used to assess the pertinent variables using a correlational design. Results showed that sex (i.e., male), low mindfulness, low identity exploration, and low other-focused orientation were risk factors for primary psychopathy. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of emerging adulthood development.
