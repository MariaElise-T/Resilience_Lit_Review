The implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility boosts the EU's power to transform Member States, especially in the field of public management. The conditioning of the Member States to link proposed investments in their plans in order to overcome the effects of the crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to boost the implementation of the Green Pact on structural reforms transforms this temporary instrument in the main driver for deepening European integration. In the case of Romania, one of the important results pursued as part of the reforms related to the public administration sector, correlated with those related to the reform of public finances, refers to the improvement of the planning system of public policies and programs in accordance with budgetary scheduling. In this context, it is expected that following the implementation of these structural reforms, the national system for public policies and programs evaluation will strengthen significantly. The article aims to discuss certain aspects related to the dynamics of the use of public policies and programs evaluations in various stakes specific to the public management sector. Thus, in the first part of the article, the dynamics of the institutionalization of the national system for public policies and programs evaluation is described and analysed. In the second part, the strengthening premises of the national evaluation system for public intervention are analysed as a result of the implementation of a package of structural reforms which are specific to strategic planning and public management.
