This study aims to address the gaps in the existing literature on the use of biomaterials in achieving SDG 9, identify gaps in current knowledge, and provide insights for future research directions. A narrative review of 62 papers published between 1996-mid 2023 in which use of biomaterials in achieving SDG 9 ( build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation) shows that biomaterials have great potential to transform the construction and infrastructure industries by providing sustainable, biodegradable, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional materials. The use of biomaterials and new technologies in various industries has the potential to create significant economic, social, and environmental impacts. However, realizing these benefits requires investment in research and development, improving production processes, and creating policies that support the use of sustainable biomaterials. There is a need to consider the sustainability and environmental impact of biomaterials in various applications, including medical devices, orthopedic biomaterials, and biofuels, among others. Their development and implementation may require supportive policy and governance frameworks. Future research directions can focus on several areas such as optimization of biocompatibility and biodegradability of biomaterials, developing scalable and cost-effective manufacturing processes for sustainable biomaterials.
