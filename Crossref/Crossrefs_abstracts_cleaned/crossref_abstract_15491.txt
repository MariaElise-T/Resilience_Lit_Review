Obando, Wright and Hill's (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2022) study of young children exposed to community violence in Colombia is a most welcome addition to the literature on risk and protective pathways related to callous and unemotional (CU) traits. The key contributions of this study can be viewed in light of calls for a new wave of global research into resilience in children and youth. These contributions also highlight the need for further research into CU traits in diverse sociocultural contexts, and in particular, research addressing questions concerning (a) multiple pathways to CU traits; (b) community violence and other forms of adversity; and (c) the developmental timing of adversity.
