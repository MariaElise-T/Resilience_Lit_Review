Schools are a fundamental context for processes of promotion and generation of resilience, since they focus not only on aspects of academic development, but also of personal and social development. Resilience in the teacher has a dual function. On the one hand, as resilient professionals, teachers can foster the development of resilience in their students; on the other hand, teaching resilience facilitates their own personal and professional well-being. Despite research highlighting the benefits of resilience in education, there is scarce research focused on assessing resilience in teachers. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of Connor and Davidson’s 10-item resilience scale (CD-RISC 10©) in a sample of 290 teachers. A confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) is performed, which shows that the 10 items on the CD-RISC 10© Resilience Scale form a one-dimensional structure, with high reliability, McDonald’s Omega coefficient (ω = 0.80) and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α = 0.87). The results obtained in this work support the use of the scale for the assessment of resilience in teachers of Infant, Primary and Special Education, which is considered very useful, not only to know their degree of resilience, but also to assess the effectiveness of training programs.
