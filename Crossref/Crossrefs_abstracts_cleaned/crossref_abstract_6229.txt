Purpose: Late adolescence is widely noted as significant for laying the foundation for distinctive neurologic, cognitive, and social changes as well as functional maturity.  As this stage is the foundation for ongoing development throughout one's life, any maladjustment at this age may affect the whole life of the individual. Young adults are the population most at risk of adverse childhood experiences (ACE), a traumatic occurrence that happened before the age of eighteen.  Resilience helps individuals bounce back from adversity and achieve success in their lives. The connection between adverse childhood experience (ACE) and resilience can aid individuals in overcoming challenging circumstances and shield them from acquiring mental health issues.
Methodology:  A cross-sectional research approach was used to collect information from 154 late young adult students from Mangalore, ranging in age from 18 to 25 years. 
Results: The study emphasizes the significance of identifying and addressing ACEs early in a child's life to reduce their long-term consequences on resilience. A significant but weak correlation was found between adverse childhood experiences and resilience. 
Originality: The present research is of interest since it examines the relationship between adversity in childhood (ACE) and resilience, which can aid individuals in overcoming challenging circumstances and shield them from acquiring mental health issues. A further improvement in this area may benefit the total well-being of humanity in many aspects
