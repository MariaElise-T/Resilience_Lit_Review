The complexity, internal and external risks, and significant social impact of megaprojects make their organizational resilience particularly important. To survive potential adversities, megaproject organizational resilience depends on collective mindfulness. Drawing on an attention-based view, this study investigates the mechanisms of collective mindfulness for megaproject organizational resilience as a process that functions prior to, during, and after recovery from crises. The results from analyzing six embedded crisis events in two megaprojects indicate that collective mindfulness influences organizational resilience processes through the mechanisms of awareness allocation, emotional detachment, and attention alignment. The study's theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
