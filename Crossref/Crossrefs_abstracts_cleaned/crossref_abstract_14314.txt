The concept of resilience is particularly applicable to urban planning if the complexity and various interconnected systems of a city are considered. The city of Porto Alegre has long been studied in academic circles for its tradition of citizen participation in local decision-making. Porto Alegre recently embarked on the development and implementation of a resilience strategy under Rockefeller's Foundation 100 Resilient Cities Project umbrella. This article uses descriptive exploratory methods to document the development and implementation of a Porto Alegre resilience strategy, which relied on the city's previous success in implementing innovative participatory methods. The institutionalization and regulatory frameworks necessary for the implementation of resilience strategies were also documented, uncovering a tripod of resilience that articulates relationships between civil society, government, and academia to achieve a successful implementation.
