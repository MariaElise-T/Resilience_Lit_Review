 Adolescent mothers and their children are among the most vulnerable and challenging clients that social workers serve. With the profession's strong commitment to evidence-based practice in mind, we synthesize current research and theory within a framework that promotes enhanced awareness of the client, practitioner, and larger sociopolitical environment by utilizing risk and resilience and feminist practice approaches. These approaches complement one another and provide a strong conceptual and empirical base for intervention. First, we outline key risk and resilience factors, paying specific attention to potential cumulative trauma. Then we explore the feminist practice perspective as an organizing conceptual framework and empowerment tool for adolescent mothers. A case example illustrates the model in a hypothetical practice situation.
