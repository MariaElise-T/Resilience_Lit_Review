Hosting Mega Sport Events (MSEs) is a formidable expedition that requires enormous investments and that has the potential to reform the nation’s future and create a lasting legacy. However, the increase in environmental concerns is pushing host cities to adopt a compact event approach. Compactness increases the concentration of the load on host cities’ infrastructures, which have to preserve an acceptable level of functionality under any possible disturbance; in other words, they should be resilient. Among these infrastructures, the road network plays the most prominent role in the fans’ experiences and the event’s success. To assess its resilience during MSE, we proposed a multilevel assessment approach that focuses on the network cohesion and critical trips performance under several disturbance scenarios, including natural hazards, intentional attacks, and accidents. The framework was applied to the Doha road network, since Doha will be a host city for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022, which exhibited a high level of resilience to intentional attacks and accidents scenarios. However, during the natural hazard scenario (flooding), the network experienced severe fragmentation, signaling weak resilience and highlighting the need to improve storm management plans. Future research could investigate the use of weighted graphs to increase the accuracy or incorporate different assessment approaches into the framework.
