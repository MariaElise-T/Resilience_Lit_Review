AbstractThe goal of this study was to explore the individual, cultural–relational–communal, and systemic factors associated with refugee resilience. Using constructivist grounded theory, we explored the concept of resilience through individual and focus group interviews with 21 refugees and 25 staff members working with this population in the United States. Our findings illustrate a multilayered and dynamic model that presents resilience in refugees as a fluid and complex phenomenon involving (a) individual, (b) community, and (c) societal conditions that either facilitate or hinder refugees’ ability to bounce back from the trauma(s) they have experienced. The authors discuss the implications of this model for developing a range of intervention strategies that aid in fostering refugee resilience at individual, community, and societal levels.
