 A recent review of the FHWA Emergency Relief Program identified the need for standardized procedures to guide states and FHWA when emergency relief projects are developed and reviewed and when eligibility decisions are made. This study builds on the risk analysis and management for critical asset protection approach developed to assess risk for critical infrastructure and reflects the requirements of the FHWA emergency relief program and manual. The approach outlined provides a process for state highway agencies and FHWA division offices to assess the reduced risk and improved resilience of design alternatives as compared with the restore-in-kind design for sites that qualify for emergency relief funds. The process outlined is also applicable to state highway agencies' all-hazards-risk analysis required for their risk-based asset management programs. The extent of damage that occurred from the September 2013 Colorado flood provides a rich environment to test this process and approach. In addition, the Colorado Department of Transportation's desire to provide as much insight as possible to its peer states through this recovery effort provides FHWA with a unique opportunity to develop and refine procedures with full cooperation from a leading state highway agency.
