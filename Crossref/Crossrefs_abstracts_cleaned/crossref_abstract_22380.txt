AbstractWhile conceptual definitions have provided a foundation for measuring inequality of access and resilience in urban facilities, the challenge for researchers and practitioners alike has been to develop analytical support for urban system development that reduces inequality and improves resilience. Using 30 million large-scale anonymized smartphone-location data, here, we calibrate models to optimize the distribution of facilities and present insights into the interplay between equality and resilience in the development of urban facilities. Results from ten metropolitan counties in the United States reveal that inequality of access to facilities is due to the inconsistency between population and facility distributions, which can be reduced by minimizing total travel costs for urban populations. Resilience increases with more equitable facility distribution by increasing effective embeddedness ranging from 10% to 30% for different facilities and counties. The results imply that resilience and equality are related and should be considered jointly in urban system development.
