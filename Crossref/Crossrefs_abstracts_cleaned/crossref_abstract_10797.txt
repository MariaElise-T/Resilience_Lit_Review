 The Walsh Family Resilience Questionnaire (WFRQ; Walsh, 2016) attempted to operationalize family resilience in three domains: belief systems, organization patterns, and communication/problem-solving. However, neither the reliability nor validity of the questionnaire has been established. This study examined the WFRQ among 603 adults from a community-based sample with a focus on (1) descriptive statistics and (2) factor structure. Preliminary results suggest that most WFRQ items are suitable for measuring family resilience. Findings also suggested that there are two additional domains that may comprise family resilience. Recommendations for future evaluation and use of the WFRQ are provided.
