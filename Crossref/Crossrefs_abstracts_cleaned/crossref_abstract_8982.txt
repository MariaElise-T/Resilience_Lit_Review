AbstractPopulation mobility has become an inevitable trend of social transformation in contemporary China. Parental migration has changed family structure patterns and brought great uncertainty to the psychological well‐being of left‐behind children. By comparing left‐behind children to children of non‐migrants, this study examines the impact of parental migration on children's psychological well‐being and the potential support of schools for children's resilience development along three dimensions: children's school belonging, teacher–student relationships and peer support. Using a mixed‐method approach, this study draws on an original survey of children (N = 605) and in‐depth interviews with children, parents, grandparents, and teachers (N = 41) in Hunchun City, Northeast China. Overall, maternal migration has a negative impact on children's psychological well‐being. In addition to teacher–student relationships, school belonging and peer support significantly mitigate this negative impact; qualitative data further suggest that peer support distracts from, rather than offsets, children's poor psychological well‐being associated with maternal migration.
