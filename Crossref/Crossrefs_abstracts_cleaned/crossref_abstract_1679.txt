The adoption of the Strategy for the Spatial Development of the Russian Federation marked a new stage in the development of the practice of territorial strategizing. However, the lack of terminological clarity is one of the factors limiting the potential of this institution. Thus, the sustainability of socio-economic development, which is somehow present as the main goal in most territorial strategies, raises a number of questions. Taking into account the accumulated domestic and world experience, there are several interpretations of this concept: sustainability as stable rates of economic growth; sustainability as a concept developed at the UNO, requiring a balanced account of the environmental, social and economic components of social development; resistance to counteraction to various challenges and shocks. This article attempts to outline the main problems that arise due to the lack of clarity in the “dilution” of these concepts. In the world scientific literature and practice, the territorial potential for resilience to disasters has long been described by the concept of “resilience”, the content of which is considered in the paper.
