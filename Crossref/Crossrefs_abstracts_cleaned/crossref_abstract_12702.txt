Abstract  Research into Aboriginal health has tended to focus on the morbidity of babies and young children, or on the chronic illnesses of adults. Adolescent Aborigines are rarely the target of health research. While health services for Aboriginal people, even in remote areas, have improved enormously over the last few years with the provision of Aboriginal‐controlled organizations, health services alone do not prevent the major causes of morbidity. In any case, young people, particularly adolescent boys, are poor users of these facilities. The major causes of adolescent Aboriginal morbidity and mortality are preventable: they have to do with ways of living, with the social, cultural and physical environments which surround adolescents. The paper draws on anthropological fieldwork which pays close attention to these issues. The paper examines the concept of ‘adolescence’ among Aboriginal groups, and explores the reasons for the resilience of some populations to a particular health problem, that of petrol sniffing among the young.
