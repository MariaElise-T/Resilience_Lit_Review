AbstractOffshore wind energy (OWE) production is a crucial element for increasing the amount of renewable energy. Consequently, one can observe a strong and constant rise of the OWE industry, turning it to an important contributor of national energy provision. This trend, however, is accompanied by increasing pressure on the reliability, safety, and security of the OWE infrastructure. Related security threats are characterized by high uncertainty regarding impact and probability leading to considerable complication of the risk assessment. On the other hand, the resilience concept emphasizes the consideration of the systemâ€™s response to such threats, and thus, offers a solution for dealing with the high uncertainty. In this work, we present an approach for combining the strengths of risk and resilience management to provide a solution for handling security threats in OWE infrastructures. Within this context, we introduce a quality assessment enabling the quantification of the trustworthiness of obtained results.
