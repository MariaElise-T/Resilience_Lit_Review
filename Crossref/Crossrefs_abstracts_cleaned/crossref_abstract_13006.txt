With the acceleration of global climate change and urbanization, many large and medium-sized cities in China have been frequently subjected to heavy rains and floods. Thus, the question of how to reduce the impact of floods and achieve rapid recovery has attracted much attention. We use the urban community as the basic unit to examine the living environment, internal facilities, and surrounding environment characteristics of six different types of communities in the Jianye District of Nanjing City. First, we use factor analysis and the binary logistic regression model to analyze pre-disaster preparation, disaster response, and post-disaster recovery. Second, we analyze the resilience of the community at different stages. Then, we explore the influencing factors of the built environment on the resilience of the community. Results show that the built-up environmental factors, such as topography, riverfront, building coverage ratio, green space rate, and land use diversity, have a significant impact on community resilience. Finally, we proposed several suggestions for improving the flood resilience of Nanjing City.
