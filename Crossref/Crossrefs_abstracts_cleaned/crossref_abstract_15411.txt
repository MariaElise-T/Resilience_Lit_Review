AbstractResearch suggests that the demands of parenting have increased during the COVID‐19 pandemic, especially for mothers. Widespread loss of childcare and in‐person schooling forced parents to make adjustments to care for their children in new ways, many while working remotely. This qualitative study, guided by Walsh's theory of family resilience, examines mothers' experiences with stress and resilience as they adapted to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data were gathered as part of a longitudinal, mixed‐methods study that examined family stress and resilience among mothers of children ages zero to five. The authors conducted in‐depth interviews between June and August 2020 with mothers (n = 15) of children under age six. Three themes emerged to characterize pandemic parenting: 24/7 parenting, changing expectations, and making it work. Recommendations are provided for researchers and practitioners working with mothers of young children, with emphasis on mothers' aptitudes for resilience in times of crisis.
