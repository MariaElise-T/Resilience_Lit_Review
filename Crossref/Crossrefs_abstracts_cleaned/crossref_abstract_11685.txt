AbstractFor the integrity monitoring of a multi-source PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing) resilient fusion navigation system, a theoretical framework of multi-level autonomous integrity monitoring is proposed. According to the mode of multi-source fusion navigation, the framework adopts the top-down logic structure and establishes the navigation source fault detection model based on the multi-combination separation residual method to detect and isolate the fault source at the system level and subsystem level. For isolated non-redundant navigation sources, the system level recovery verification model is used. For the isolated multi-redundant navigation sources, the sensor fault detection model optimized with the dimension-expanding matrix is used to detect and isolate the fault sensors, and the isolated fault sensors are verified in real-time. Finally, according to the fault detection and verification results at each level, the observed information in the fusion navigation solution is dynamically adjusted. On this basis, the integrity risk dynamic monitoring tree is established to calculate the Protection Level (PL) and evaluate the integrity of the multi-source integrated navigation system. The autonomous integrity monitoring method proposed in this paper is tested using a multi-source navigation system integrated with Inertial Navigation System (INS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Long Baseline Location (LBL), and Ultra Short Baseline Location (USBL). The test results show that the proposed method can effectively isolate the fault source within 5 s, and can quickly detect multiple faulty sensors, ensuring that the positioning accuracy of the fusion navigation system is within 5 m, effectively improving the resilience and reliability of the multi-source fusion navigation system.
