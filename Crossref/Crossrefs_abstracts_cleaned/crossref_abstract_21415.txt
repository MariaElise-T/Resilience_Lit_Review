Extreme climatic events (ECEs) are increasing in frequency and magnitude as part of global climate change, with severe consequences for both nature and human societies. While many restoration projects account for gradual climate change, ECEs are rarely considered. Through a literature search and the use of expert opinion, we reviewed the impacts of ECEs on habitat restoration projects, and the degree to which they were resilient. ECEs had overwhelmingly negative impacts on habitat restoration, although some projects also reported positive outcomes. The severity of impact varied among and within projects. Nearly all projects that included more than one focal species, life stage or genotype, restoration method, site, habitat type, or microhabitat reported better outcomes for at least one of these project aspects. We suggest that practitioners may be able to reduce risk from future ECEs through a portfolio approach, incorporating heterogeneity into project design, including in site selection and propagule choices.
