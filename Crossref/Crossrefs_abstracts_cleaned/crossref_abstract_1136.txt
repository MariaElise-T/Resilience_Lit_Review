Purpose
 – This case study aims to explore the findings and documented impacts of Volunteering Qld’s “Step Up” programme which is the largest community resilience building programme led by a non-government organisation (NGO) in Australia. 


Design/methodology/approach
 – It will describe the programme design and systems that support this type of qualitative work using evidence-based data collected by the project coordinators over the duration of the programme and contextualising these within a broader resilience framework. 


Findings
 – This case study will demonstrate and advocate for the need to create stronger partnerships and more significant opportunities for the sector to engage in resilience-building activities. 


Research limitations/implications
 – The scope of this project was limited by organisational capacity to conduct research into its own programme, as it was being delivered and with limited resourcing. There is a significant need for further research into the work of NGOs in the emergency management and disaster resilience and the impacts of these programmes on communities. 


Practical implications
 – The practical implications of this case study is a recognition that there are inherent challenges for disaster management agencies trying to engage communities in dialogue around planning risk-informed response and recovery plans for disasters. 


Social implications
 – However, NGOs are ideally placed to work in and with the communities which they service, to educate and support them at all stages of disaster management. 


Originality/value
 – This is a unique first-hand account of the experience of a NGO delivering community resilience programme in Australia and provides an important insight for practitioners and researchers alike.
