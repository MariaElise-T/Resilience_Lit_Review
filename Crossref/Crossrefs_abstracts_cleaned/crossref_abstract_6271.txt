Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the digital confidence of elder adults and identify behavioral patterns for technology that are related to cognitive abilities among elders. Method An observational study was conducted using a sample of 94 elders, aged 53 to 86 years. Neuropsychological and emotional measures were used, and technology use was assessed. Results Finding showed elders by resilient neuropsychological aspects can have a good affinity for technology. We examined the role of not only cognitive reserve levels but also demographic characteristics (i.e., age, educational level) and found that elderly were more adherent to digital resources. Technology can be a beneficial resource to those with medium levels of cognitive reserve and make them feel “like they are leading an active lifestyle.” Conclusions The focal point of our findings is the relevance of cognitive reserve during older adulthood as a key factor that should be examined in investigations on successful aging; it would be more interesting to examine these factors within the context of analyses on the impact of technology on aging and digital living.
