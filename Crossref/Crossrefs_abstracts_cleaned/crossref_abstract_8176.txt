This article addresses the many complex and traumatic losses wrought by the COVID‐19 pandemic. In contrast to individually based, symptom‐focused grief work, a resilience‐oriented, systemic approach with complex losses contextualizes the distress and mobilizes relational resources to support positive adaptation. Applying a family resilience framework to pandemic‐related losses, discussion focuses on the importance of shared belief systems in (1) meaning‐making processes; (2) a positive, hopeful outlook and active agency; and (3) transcendent values and spiritual moorings for inspiration, transformation, and positive growth. Practice guidelines are offered to facilitate adaptation and resilience.
