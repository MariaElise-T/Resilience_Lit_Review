 Introducing the Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training paradigm into live air combat training means introducing significant changes into a complex and established training system. To facilitate the transition, research was performed to identify possible new hazards that might emerge as a result of the changes and to assess the ability of the live training system to withstand them. Aircrew interviews were conducted and submitted to qualitative analysis, the results of which were further assessed by air combat experts, to identify both potential hazards and mechanisms the training system uses to withstand, or be resilient to, hazards. This paper focuses on those system resilience mechanisms and their adequacy for protecting system effectiveness and aircrew safety in the face of changes associated with the adoption of LVC training.
