AbstractModels to estimate economic impacts of disasters have recently been augmented to include resilience. However, most research has incorporated only a limited set of resilience tactics and has not estimated their individual loss reduction effect. We present a comprehensive framework for estimating the relative effects of a broad set of post‐disaster resilience tactics. Our methodological innovation is illustrated by adapting the TERM multi‐regional CGE model for a seaport disruption, distinguishing inherent resilience working through the price system from adaptive resilience and other inherent tactics to cope with input shortages. We also overcome a path‐dependency problem in the modelling process.
