AbstractAimsSexual and gender minorities are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety caused by COVID‐19. However, they also have specific variables that have been little studied but which may protect them from this adverse situation. The aim of this study was to find out whether there were differences in socio‐demographic and psychosocial variables in two groups of Spanish gay young people (high and low resilience), and predictors of risk and protective factors were examined.MethodsNine hundred and seventy‐nine young homosexuals (389; 39.73% self‐reported as women) aged between 18 and 26 years old who experienced mandatory confinement due to COVID‐19, completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Hope, perceived self‐efficacy, reappraisal index, coping humour, anxiety, depression were assessed along with socio‐demographic information. Data were collected between 15 and 26 April 2020.ResultsSocio‐demographic variables that were predictive of highly resilient behaviour included being between 24 and 26 years old, living with LGBTI+ peers and living in big cities, protective psychosocial variables included reframing in reappraising the confinement situation, humour as coping, social support from significant others and self‐efficacy.ConclusionThis is one of the first studies on this subject of compulsory COVID‐19 confinement on young homosexuals in Spain. Mental health professionals and organizations should also include work on psychosocial protective factors, not just risk factors, to enhance resilient outcomes in this group.
