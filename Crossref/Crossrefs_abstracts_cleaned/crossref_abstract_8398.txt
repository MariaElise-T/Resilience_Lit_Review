After the 1996 World Food Summit, the declaration of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, food security has become a priority in the international agenda. The high incidence of undernutrition in developing countries calls attention to the need for adopting effective measures towards achieving zero hunger by 2030. In line with the alarming statements, experts highlight the seriousness of the influence of climate change on agriculture in the developing countries of Africa and Asia, and therefore, on food security (IPCC 2014, 2019a, 2019b). This paper demonstrates the influence of climate change on food security by examining the impact of climate change on the agricultural systems in the regions most affected by climate change and with the highest proportion of undernourished people - Asia and Africa - to expose and advocate the use of climate-smart agricultural practices adapted to regional vulnerabilities in order to strengthen resilience to climate change and contribute to food security.
