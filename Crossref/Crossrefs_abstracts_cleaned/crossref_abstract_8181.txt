 Test-retest correlations provide the most appropriate estimate of reliability when short scales are used to measure complex constructs. A brief, 15-item hardiness scale was developed from a longer version known as the Dispositional Resilience Scale (DRS), which first appeared in 1989. This short hardiness scale (DRSâ€“15) has the advantages of brevity, good internal consistency, and validity (Barone, 1995, 1999); however, test-retest reliability has not yet been estimated. The present study addresses this issue, using a sample of 104 military academy cadets. The 3-wk. test-retest reliability coefficient was .78.
