The security and safety in fulfilling the roles of the institutions of a state are essential characteristics of any contemporary society. In order to understand the complex of threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the dynamics of their manifestation in generating crisis situations, it is required to take a comprehensive approach to the decision-makers in the societal domains: political/diplomatic, military, economic, social, critical infrastructural, informational and environmental. In this context, the development of the resilience capacity in the contemporary societal environment takes place in the perspective of the contribution of all the decision-making factors based on efficient inter-institutional planning and their proactive participation. Due to the specifics of each societal field, the situation can be understood under different coordinates, which causes difficulties in developing estimates of the crisis situations and initiating measures to prevent and counteract them. One of the solutions identified for the decision-makers to conduct a proactive behaviour in crisis situations specific to the contemporary societal environment can be expressed within the operational art of military action planning. Thus, we deem appropriate to extend the operational art specific to the military field to other societal fields and redefine the resilience capacity in the contemporary societal environment facing the new complex of threats and vulnerabilities as the COVID-19 pandemic situation.
