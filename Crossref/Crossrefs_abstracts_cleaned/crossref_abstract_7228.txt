This study aimed to explore the mediation effects of bullying on the connection between aggression and resilience among Azerbaijani adolescents. The research involved 623 participant from various regions in Azerbaijan, and data were collected using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Illinois Bully Scale, and the Brief Resilience Scale. To analyze the data, correlations and a bootstrapping procedure were employed. The results from bootstrapping indicated that the mediating role of bullying (bullying, victim, and fighter) was statistically significant. This implies that bullying, victim, and fighter partially mediated the relationship aggression and resilience among Azerbaijani adolescents. As a conclusion, to enhance adolescents&rsquo; resilience, it is crucial to address aggression and bullying. By focusing on these aspects, adolescents&rsquo; overall resilience can be negatively impacted, leading to improved well-being and performance in the school setting.
