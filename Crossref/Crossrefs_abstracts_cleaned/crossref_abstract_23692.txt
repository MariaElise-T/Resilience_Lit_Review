Current data show that resilience is an important factor in cancer patients’ well-being. We aim to explore the resilience of patients with lower grade glioma (LGG) and the potentially influencing factors. We performed a cross-sectional assessment of adult patients with LGG who were enrolled in the LoG-Glio registry. By phone interview, we administered the following measures: Resilience Scale (RS-13), distress thermometer, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test for visually impaired patients (MoCA-Blind), internalized stigmatization by brain tumor (ISBI), Eastern Cooperative Oncological Group performance status (ECOG), patients’ perspective questionnaire (PPQ) and typical clinical parameters. We calculated correlations and multivariate regression models. Of 74 patients who were assessed, 38% of those showed a low level of resilience. Our results revealed significant correlations of resilience with distress (p < 0.001, −0.49), MOCA (p = 0.003, 0.342), ECOG (p < 0.001, −0.602), stigmatization (p < 0.001, −0.558), pain (p < 0.001, −0.524), and occupation (p = 0.007, 0.329). In multivariate analyses, resilience was negatively associated with elevated ECOG (p = 0.020, β = −0.383) and stigmatization levels (p = 0.008, β = −0.350). Occupation showed a tendency towards a significant association with resilience (p = 0.088, β = −0.254). Overall, low resilience affected more than one third of our cohort. Low functional status is a specific risk factor for low resilience. The relevant influence of stigmatization on resilience is a novel finding for patients suffering from a glioma and should be routinely identified and targeted in clinical routine.
