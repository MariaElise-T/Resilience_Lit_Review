According to the latest PISA report, the level of mathematical competence of Spanish students is far behind the rest of the OECD countries. One of the main reasons for this is the animosity that students feel towards this subject. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the processes of overcoming the vicissitudes of mathematical anxiety with respect to motivation, metacognitive strategies and academic performance. This study involved 1742 high school students with an average age of 14.87. To analyze the variables of the study, descriptive statistical analyses and a model of structural equations were carried out. The results revealed a negative correlation between resilience and anxiety. In turn, resilience was positively related to motivation and metacognitive strategies, while anxiety was negatively related to motivation and metacognitive strategies. Motivation was positively related to metacognitive strategies and academic performance; finally, metacognitive strategies were positively related to academic performance.
