The purpose of this study was to examine the challenges and responses of senior high school Indigenous Peoples students in the Don Marcelino District secondary school regarding flexible learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed to determine the socio-demographic profile of the participants, their level of academic resiliency and performance, their level of acceptability of flexible learning, any significant relationship between acceptability responses and academic resiliency, and any significant relationship between acceptability responses and academic performance. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used, with qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews with 15 participants and analyzed using thematic analysis, and quantitative data gathered through a survey questionnaire administered to 60 respondents and analyzed using statistical analysis. The sample size was determined using purposive and stratified sampling methods. The qualitative findings revealed three major themes: consideration of students' difficulties, resolution of challenges, and gained concepts. The quantitative findings showed that respondents had high academic resilience and an acceptability response to flexible learning, and satisfactory academic performance. The results can guide schools in providing support, creating programs and activities, and increasing motivation and learning interest among Indigenous Peoples students during emergency health crises.
