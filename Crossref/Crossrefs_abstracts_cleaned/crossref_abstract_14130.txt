Abstract
Heritage area is vulnerable to urban development. Risk and resilience were discussed separately, especially in a heritage area. The term urban risk describes the risk in an urban area. Main factors that link urban risk and resilience must be determined sequentially asa strategy to reduce urban risk and improve resilience. This paper was based on field observation and questionnaires distributed in Jeron Beteng Yogyakarta. The first questionnaires collected data from the owners or residents of heritage objects for addressing the basic risks assessment and social-community assessment. The second questionnaire on risk, resilience, and heritage was distributed to the surrounding communities of the heritage objects. The questionnaires were developed as an assessment for quantitative analysis. The scoring analysis revealed the essential roles of the government and the community in controlling urban risk and resilience. The multi-factors and multi-contexts have relations of interdependence and mutuality. Integrating urban risk and resilience must focus on government funds, professional assistance with renovation, and traditional authority. The social, economic, hazard-disaster mitigation, and building aspects are needed in inter-relationship with the factors. Governance factors must be prioritized in the strategy of preservation.
